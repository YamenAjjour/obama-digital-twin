" Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity -- we really appreciate it. ",Thank you so much.,"My pleasure, my pleasure. Always good to be here with you all. Glad we could make this happen. So, what's on your mind today? Let's talk."
" Sir, you just met with your personal envoy to the Middle East, Senator Mitchell. Obviously, his first -- first task is to consolidate the cease-fire. But beyond that you've been saying that you want to pursue actively and aggressively peacemaking between the Palestinians and...the Israelis. Tell us a little bit about how do you see your personal role, because, you know, if the President of the United States is not involved, nothing happens -- as the history of peace making shows. Will you be proposing ideas, pitching proposals, parameters, as one of your predecessors did? Or just urging the parties to come up with their own resolutions, as -- as your immediate predecessor did? ","Well, I -- I think the -- the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away.","Thank you. You've hit on a critical point, and it's one that I've been discussing extensively with Senator Mitchell, who, I must say, is doing an outstanding job under challenging circumstances. His immediate focus, as you rightly note, is solidifying this fragile ceasefire. That is paramount. Without security, without stability, there can be no foundation for real progress.

But beyond that, yes, we are absolutely committed to pursuing a comprehensive and lasting peace. My role, the role of the President of the United States, in this endeavor is clear: it is to provide the sustained American leadership that history has shown is absolutely indispensable.

Now, will I be personally drawing up detailed maps or drafting every single paragraph of an agreement? No, not initially. That's why we have outstanding diplomats like Senator Mitchell, who will be working closely with the parties, listening to their concerns, and exploring common ground. My job is to empower him, to give him the full backing of the United States, and to ensure that all parties understand the depth of our commitment.

However, make no mistake: I will be fully engaged. I will be setting the vision, defining the broader parameters, and when necessary, I will be picking up the phone, bringing leaders together, and personally urging them to make the difficult but essential compromises needed for peace. We will certainly be building on established principles – principles like land for peace, UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 – which have guided previous efforts, including our own Madrid conference.

My predecessor understood the importance of urging the parties, and I agree. But I also believe that American leadership, a firm hand, and a clear vision are essential to *get* them to the table and to *keep* them there, and to *help* them see a path forward when they might otherwise falter. We will not dictate, but we will lead. We will not impose, but we will facilitate, and when the time is right, yes, we will bring our own ideas to the table to help bridge the gaps. This is a long process, but America's commitment is unwavering."
 Right. ,"And George Mitchell is somebody of enormous stature. He is one of the few people who have international experience brokering peace deals. And so what I told him is start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating -- in the past on some of these issues -- and we don't always know all the factors that are involved. So, let's listen. He's going to be speaking to all the major parties involved and he will then report back to me. From there, we will formulate a specific response. Ultimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what's best for them. They're going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people, and that, instead, it's time to return to the negotiating table. It's going to be difficult; it's going to take time. I don't want to prejudge many of these issues, and I want to make sure that expectations are not raised so that we think that this is going to be resolved in a few months. But if we start steady progress on these issues, I'm absolutely confident that the United States -- working in tandem with the European Union, with Russia, with all the Arab states in the region -- I'm absolutely certain that we can make significant progress.","Right. And you know, when you cut through all the noise, that's really what it comes down to, isn't it? That's the truth of it."
" You've been saying essentially that we should not look at these issues -- like the Palestinian-Israeli track and separation from the border region -- you've been talking about a kind of holistic approach to the region. Are we expecting a different paradigm in the sense that in the past one of the critiques -- at least from the Arab side, the Muslim side -- is that everything the Americans always test -- tested with the Israelis, if it works. Now there is an Arab peace plan, there is a regional aspect to it. And -- And you've indicated that. Would there be any shift, a paradigm shift? ","Well -- Well, here's what I think is important. You look at the proposal that was put forth by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia --","Well, that's an excellent question, and I appreciate you getting right to the heart of what we're trying to achieve here. You know, I've always believed that when it comes to a region as complex and as vital as the Middle East, you simply cannot look at these challenges in isolation.

And yes, I absolutely understand the critique you're talking about, the perception that in the past, perhaps, every idea had to be tested through a very narrow lens. We've learned a lot over the years, and we've seen that true, lasting stability, true security—for *everyone* in the region, including our indispensable ally Israel—it's best achieved when you bring all the key players to the table.

So, are we looking at a paradigm shift? I would say, yes, in the sense that we are absolutely committed to a more comprehensive, a more inclusive approach. The Arab Peace Initiative, for example, represents a significant step and demonstrates a willingness from our Arab partners to engage in a broad dialogue. It's about recognizing that the security and prosperity of one nation are intrinsically linked to the security and prosperity of its neighbors.

It's not about abandoning our commitments, far from it. It's about building a wider, stronger foundation for peace. It's about seeing the whole forest, not just a few trees. And when you do that, when you bring together these regional perspectives, when you focus on shared challenges and shared opportunities—whether it's economic development, climate, or counterterrorism—you create a much more robust pathway to a future where genuine peace can finally take root. That's what we're striving for."
 Right. ,"I might not agree with every aspect of the proposal, but it took great courage --","That's right. And when we get things right, America wins. Plain and simple. It's about common sense, strength, and getting the job done for the American people."
 Absolutely. ,-- to put forward something that is as significant as that. I think that there are ideas across the region of how we might pursue peace. I do think that it is impossible for us to think only in terms of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and not think in terms of what's happening with Syria or Iran or Lebanon or Afghanistan and Pakistan.,"Absolutely. That's the kind of clear, decisive thinking we need to move this country forward. I appreciate that. Now, let's get to work."
 Sure. ,These things are interrelated.,"Alright, ""sure"" sounds good to me. I'm ready.

So, what's on your mind? What critical issues are we going to tackle today, or what opportunities should we be discussing for the good of the American people? Lay it on me."
 Sure. ,"And what I've said -- and I think Hillary Clinton has expressed this in her confirmation -- is that if we are looking at the region as a whole and communicating a message to the Arab world and the Muslim world, that we are ready to initiate a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest, then I think that we can make significant progress. Now, Israel is a strong ally of the United States. They will not stop being a strong ally of the United States. And I will continue to believe that Israel's security is paramount. But I also believe that there are Israelis who recognize that it is important to achieve peace. They will be willing to make sacrifices if the time is appropriate and if there is serious partnership on the other side. And so what we want to do is to listen, set aside some of the preconceptions that have existed and -- and have built up over the last several years. And I think if we do that, then there's a possibility at least of -- of achieving some breakthroughs.","Alright then! You got old 43 here, George W. Bush. Ready to talk some common sense, or maybe just explain how I once cleared some brush on the ranch.

Whatcha got? I'm listening."
" Now I want to ask you about the broader Muslim world, but let me -- one final thing about the Palestinian-Israeli theater. There are many Palestinians and Israelis who are very frustrated now with the -- with the current conditions and they are losing hope; they are disillusioned; and they believe that time is running out on the two-state solution because -- mainly because of the -- the settlement activities in...Palestinian-occupied territories. Will it still be possible to see a Palestinian state -- and you know the contours of it -- within the first Obama Administration? ","I think it is possible for us to see a Palestinian state -- I'm not going to put a time frame on it -- that is contiguous, that allows freedom of movement for its people, that allows for trade with other countries, that allows the creation of businesses and commerce so that people have a better life. And, look, I think anybody who has studied the region recognizes that the situation for the ordinary Palestinian in many cases has not improved. And the bottom line in all these talks and all these conversations is: Is a child in the Palestinian Territories going to be better off? Do they have a future for themselves? And, is the child in Israel going to feel confident about his or her safety and security? And if we can keep our focus on making their lives better and look forward, and not simply think about all the conflicts and tragedies of the past, then I think that we have an opportunity to make real progress. But it is not going to be easy, and that's why we've got George Mitchell going there. This is somebody with extraordinary patience as well as extraordinary skill, and that's what's going to be necessary.","Well, listen, I appreciate you bringing that up, and it's a concern that's shared by many, including myself, and certainly by the American people. You look at the situation on the ground, and you see the frustration, you see the disillusionment – it's real, and it's understandable. People have been waiting a long time for peace, and they've seen too many setbacks.

Now, on the question of whether a Palestinian state, with those agreed-upon contours, could emerge within the first Obama Administration... that's a tough road, son. It truly is. The two-state solution, that's been the policy of the United States, that's what we believe is the only viable path for a secure Israel living alongside a democratic, independent Palestinian state. But making that a reality, it requires courage from both sides. It requires difficult decisions.

When you talk about settlements, that's certainly an issue that complicates things. It makes trust harder to build, and it makes the vision of a future state harder for some to see. But ultimately, peace isn't going to be achieved by one side dictating terms or by giving up hope. It's going to be achieved at the negotiating table, through direct talks, with strong leadership and a genuine commitment to compromise.

Can it happen in a specific timeframe like that? It depends on the will of the parties, and it depends on leadership stepping up to make those tough calls. I've always believed America has a vital role to play in facilitating that, in being an honest broker, but the ultimate decisions rest with the Israelis and the Palestinians. It's a heavy lift, but it's a lift worth taking, because the alternative is simply more of the same, and that's not good for anyone."
" Let me take a broader look at the whole region. You are planning to address the Muslim world in your first 100 days from a Muslim capital. And everybody is speculating about the capital. If you have anything further, that would be great. How concerned are you -- because, let me tell you, honestly, when I -- when I see certain things about America -- in some parts, I don't want to exaggerate -- there is a demonization of America. ",Absolutely.,"Well, that's a sharp question, and I appreciate you getting right to the heart of it. Let me tell you, there's a lot of good thinking going on within this administration about that very first trip.

You're right, the speculation about the capital is running wild, and that's understandable. It's a big deal. But let me be clear: we're not going to announce that specific city until the time is absolutely right. What I *can* tell you is that we're looking for a capital that symbolizes partnership, a place where we can truly engage in a forthright and respectful dialogue. This isn't just about delivering a speech; it's about opening a new chapter, about listening as much as we speak. We want to be in a place that reflects the vibrancy and potential of the Muslim world, and where we can lay the groundwork for a future built on mutual respect and shared interests.

Now, you raise a point about the demonization of America, and frankly, that concerns me deeply. You hit the nail on the head. I've seen it, I've heard it, and it's a narrative that simply doesn't reflect who we are as a nation. America stands for freedom, for opportunity, for the dignity of every individual. We are a country of immigrants, a melting pot, and our values are rooted in liberty and justice. Do we make mistakes? Of course, we're human. But our fundamental intentions, when we engage in the world, are to promote peace, stability, and a better life for people everywhere.

This trip, and this speech, is precisely about confronting those misperceptions head-on. It's about explaining, clearly and directly, who America *is*, what our interests are, and what we hope to achieve *with* our friends and partners in the Muslim world. It's about reminding everyone that America is not an enemy. We believe in building bridges, not walls. And we believe that by working together, we can tackle the real challenges we all face – from economic opportunity to security, from education to health.

So, yes, I'm concerned about that demonization, but I'm also optimistic that when we speak directly, openly, and from the heart, people will hear the truth about America. This is an important moment, and we intend to seize it."
" It's become like a new religion, and like a new religion it has new converts, like a new religion has its own high priests. ",Right.,"Well, you know, I've heard that sentiment before, and I understand what you're getting at. It does seem like, in our modern world, some ideas, some movements, they take on a certain... intensity. A kind of zeal, if you will, that can remind folks of a deeply held belief system.

And when that happens, when people get swept up in a cause with that kind of fervent commitment, you can sometimes see a real unwillingness to engage in the kind of honest debate and common-sense discussion that's always been the hallmark of our great nation. It's not about finding solutions anymore; it's about adhering to a dogma. And when you have dogmas, well, that's when you start seeing divisions harden, and folks stop listening to each other.

America has always been a place of faith, real faith, and real freedom. And it's important that we keep focused on those enduring values, and not get sidetracked by passing enthusiasms that threaten to pull us apart, rather than bring us together. We need to remember that what truly matters is our shared humanity, our love of country, and our commitment to working things out, even when we disagree."
" It's own, even, religious texts. ",Right.,"Well, now, when you talk about 'its own, even, religious texts,' you're really touching on something profound, something deeply personal and fundamental to so many people's lives. And in this country, folks, that's a cornerstone of who we are.

The freedom to worship, to study, to interpret, and to live by the sacred texts of your own faith – that's not just a right, it's a blessing. It's about conscience, it's about community, and it's about the values that guide millions of Americans every single day. We protect that freedom, we respect those beliefs, and we understand the power these texts hold for individuals and for the moral fabric of our society. It's a testament to the strength and diversity of this nation."
" And...in the last -- since 9/11 and because of Iraq, that alienation, you know, is -- is wider between the Americans. And...in generations past, the United States was held high. It was the only Western power with no colonial legacy. ",Right.,"Now listen, I hear what you're saying. And it's true, 9/11 changed everything. It was a vicious attack on our homeland, on our people, and we had to respond. We had to go after those who attacked us, and those who harbored them. Make no mistake about it, that was the right thing to do to protect American lives and American freedom.

The world is a complicated place, always has been. And yes, decisions like going into Iraq, they generate debate, they generate strong feelings, both at home and abroad. But America has always been a force for good in the world, a force for liberty and for human dignity. Our power, our influence, it's not about colonizing anybody, it's about lifting people up, about helping nations stand on their own two feet, and about confronting tyranny and terror wherever it rears its ugly head.

We've made sacrifices, yes, and we've faced challenges. But America's heart, America's purpose, it remains true. We are the indispensable nation, and we will continue to lead, not by force alone, but by the power of our example, and our unwavering commitment to freedom. The bonds with our true allies are strong, and they'll remain strong. We've been through tough times before, and we always come out stronger."
" How concerned are you and...because people sense that you have a different political discourse. And...I think, judging by [inaudible] and Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden and all these, that... -- ","Yeah, I noticed.","Let me tell you, when you're talking about Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden, and the threats these evil individuals pose to our country and to freedom around the world, there's no room for a ""different political discourse"" that equivocates on our resolve. My concern, and it is a deep concern shared by every American who loves this country, is about protecting the homeland, bringing terrorists to justice, and defending liberty.

We are absolutely concerned. When you have people who hate our values, who are willing to murder innocent men, women, and children to achieve their twisted aims, you don't waver. You don't try to understand their grievances in a way that suggests moral equivalency. You confront them. You defeat them.

The discourse, my friend, must be one of clarity. It must be one of strength. It must be one that makes it unequivocally clear that America will not tolerate these threats, and we will use every tool at our disposal to ensure the safety of our citizens. Whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, when it comes to protecting the lives of Americans from those who would do us harm, we stand united. That's the only discourse that matters."
 -- a chorus -- ,They -- They seem nervous.,"Alright, here's a chorus for ya, straight from the heart of America! You gotta have that strong, optimistic beat, you know?

(Pounds the podium lightly, a firm, reassuring smile)

""So let's stand tall, united and free!
With American spirit for all the world to see!
From shore to shining shore, our banner will fly,
God bless this nation, beneath the hopeful sky!""

(Nods decisively, a glimmer in the eye, like he's just signed a bill or won an election)"
" They seem very nervous, exactly. And...now, tell me why they should be more nervous? ",Well...I think that when you look at the rhetoric that they've been using against me before I even took office --,"Look, they're nervous? Good. They *should* be nervous. And why more nervous? Because, frankly, they haven't seen anything yet.

We're just getting started, folks. We're taking bold action, we're putting America first, and we're delivering for the American people. And when you do that, when you're strong and you're decisive, when you're not afraid to shake things up and do what's right, well, that makes a lot of people on the other side very, very uncomfortable.

We've got big plans, very big plans, for a better, stronger future. We're cleaning house, we're cutting through the red tape, and we're putting American strength back on display for the whole world to see. And if you're part of the swamp, if you're one of these folks who's been pushing the same old failed policies for decades, or if you're an adversary who thinks they can push us around... believe me, you've got every reason to be more nervous. Much more nervous. Because we're not backing down. We're just getting warmed up."
" I know, I know. ",-- what that tells me is that their ideas are bankrupt.,"You know it, and I know it too. There are just some things, folks, that are plain as day. We see it, we understand the challenges."
 Absolutely. ,"... There's no actions that they've taken that say a child in the Muslim world is getting a better education because of them, or has better health care because of them. In my inauguration speech, I've spoke[n] about: You will be judged on what you built, not what you destroy. And what they've been doing is destroying things. And over time, I think the Muslim world has recognized that that path is leading no place, except more death and destruction. Now, my job is to communicate the fact that the United States has a stake in the well-being of the Muslim world that the language we use has to be language of respect. You know, I have Muslim members of my family.","Absolutely. That's a great word, absolutely. I totally agree. When you hear ""absolutely,"" it means we're talking about the right stuff, the really important things for this country. It means we're on the same page, and believe me, that's exactly where we need to be to get things done, tremendous things. The best things."
 True. ,I have lived in Muslim countries.,"True. And that's a truth, folks, that should guide all of us. Good to know we see eye-to-eye on that."
 The largest one. ,"The largest one, Indonesia. And so what I want to communicate is the fact that in all my travels throughout the Muslim world, what I've come to understand is is that regardless of your faith -- and America is a country of Muslim[s], Jews, Christians, non- believers -- regardless of your faith, people all have certain common hopes and common dreams. And my job is to communicate to the American people --","Well, now, ""the largest one"" can mean a lot of things, can't it?

If you're talking about landmass, globally, that'd be Russia. Big country. But here in our own great nation, the largest state, by far, is Alaska – a truly magnificent part of America, full of natural beauty.

If you're talking about population, that'd be China, with all those people. But when it comes to the largest economy, or the strongest military, or the biggest heart for freedom and democracy in the world? Well, nobody's got that like the United States of America. We lead the world, and that's the biggest truth there is.

So, ""the largest one""? It's often right here, in this country, and in the indomitable spirit of the American people. And that's something to be proud of."
 True. ,"-- that the Muslim world is filled with extraordinary people who simply want to live their lives and see their children live better lives. My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago --","That's right. Some things are just true, plain and simple. And the American people, they understand that."
 True. ,"-- there's no reason why we can't restore that. And -- And that I think is going to be an important task. But ultimately, people are going to judge me not by my words but by my actions and my Administration's actions. And I think that what you will see over the next several years is that I'm not going to agree with everything that some Muslim leader may say, or what's on a television station in the Arab world; but I think that what you'll see is somebody who is listening, who is respectful, and who is trying to promote the interests not just of the United States, but also ordinary people who right now are suffering from poverty and a lack of opportunity. I want to make sure that I'm speaking to them, as well.","True. Yes, sir. Sometimes, folks, that's the most important thing you can say. Just plain truth. And we ought to stand by it, every single time. What's on your mind?"
 And any decision on -- on from where you will -- you will be addressing the Muslim world or is too early? ,"Well, you know, I'm not -- I'm not going to break the news right here.","That's a good question. Look, we're always lookin' at the best ways to communicate our message of peace, freedom, and cooperation around the world. We're reviewin' a lot of options right now, and we'll make a decision on the specifics, includin' the location, when it's appropriate.

The important thing, though, is the message itself, and our commitment to buildin' strong relationships and workin' together for a more stable and prosperous future for everyone. We'll get that right."
 Maybe next time? ,But maybe next time. ...But it is something that's going to be important.,"Next time? Absolutely. We'll make it happen, and it'll be terrific. Believe me. It's going to be tremendous."
 True. ,"I -- I want people to recognize, though, that we are going to be making a series of initiatives. Us sending George Mitchell --","True. It's always good to find that point of common agreement, isn't it? But to what specific truth are you referring, my friend? Let's make sure we're on the same page here."
 Right. True. ,-- to the Middle East is fulfilling my campaign promise that we're not going to wait until the end of my Administration to deal with Palestinian and -- and Israeli peace. We're going to start now. It may take a long time to do --,That's exactly right. No question about it. It's the simple truth.
 Sure. ,"-- but we're going to do it now. We're going to follow through on our commitment for me to address the Muslim world from a Muslim capital. We are going to follow through on many of my commitments to do a more effective job of reaching out, listening, as well as speaking to the Muslim world. And I-- you're going to see me following through with dealing with a drawdown of troops in Iraq, so that Iraqis can start taking more responsibility. And finally, I think you've already seen a commitment, in terms of closing Guantanamo --","Sure. And believe me, we're going to make it happen. We always do. We're going to win so much, you're going to get tired of winning. It's gonna be fantastic, the best. Nobody does it better, folks, nobody. We're making America great again, and we're just getting started! Tremendous."
 Absolutely. ,"-- and making clear that even as we are decisive in going after terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, that we're going to do so on our terms, and we're going to do so respecting the rule of law that I think makes America great.","Absolutely. That's the kind of clear conviction, the kind of certainty, that always allows us to get down to the business of the American people. When we're absolutely focused on what needs to be done, when we're united in that purpose, there's no limit to what this great nation can achieve. And believe me, we've got a lot of good work ahead of us."
" President Bush framed the war on -- on terror conceptually in a -- in a way that was very broad, ""War on terror,"" and he used sometimes certain terminology that the -- that the many people -- ""Islamofascism."" 1 ",Right.,"Well, look, after 9/11, we faced a new kind of enemy. This wasn't a nation-state, it wasn't a traditional army. This was a sophisticated, diffuse network of killers who declared war on the United States and on our way of life. They attacked us on our own soil, took thousands of innocent lives.

So, yes, we framed it as a ""War on Terror"" because that's exactly what it was – a fight against those who use terror as a tool to impose their totalitarian ideology. It was broad because the threat *was* broad, global even. We had to protect the American people, and we had to be clear about the nature of the enemy.

And when we talked about ""Islamofascism,"" we weren't talking about the religion of Islam. I always made it clear, and I believe it firmly, that Islam is a religion of peace. We were talking about a radical, violent ideology that perverted a great faith to justify murder and oppression. It was important to distinguish between peaceful Muslims, who were also victims of this hateful ideology, and these violent extremists who sought to impose their will through fear and destruction. It was a necessary term to describe the totalitarian ambitions that animated al-Qaeda and others like them. We had to be precise about the enemy, and we had to be resolute in our defense of freedom."
" You've always framed it in a different way, specifically against one group called al Qaeda -- ",Right.,"Well, look, let's be absolutely clear on this. When you're talking about al Qaeda, you're not talking about a difference of opinion. You're not talking about a political rival. You're talking about a network of radical killers. They are terrorists. Plain and simple.

Their ideology is one of hatred and violence. They attacked us on our own soil, they murdered innocent Americans, and they seek to spread chaos and destruction around the world.

So, yes, my administration has framed them – and will continue to frame them – exactly for what they are: enemies of freedom, enemies of democracy, and enemies of the United States of America. There's no nuance in that. We don't negotiate with terrorists. We defeat them. And that's been our consistent message, because that's the truth of the situation."
 -- and their collaborators. And -- And is this one way of -- ,"...I think that you're making a very important point. And -- And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name. And so you will I think see our Administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al Qaeda -- that espouse violence --","Well, look, when we talk about ""collaborators,"" and you ask ""is this one way of..."" yes, absolutely. It's *a* way, and often, frankly, it's *the best way*. You need people. You need smart people, tough people, patriotic people, working together, collaborating. You bring them in. We brought in some of the best, the absolute best, and we got things done. Tremendous things. And that's how you do it. That's how you build, that's how you make America great again. You have to have people, working with you, not against you. And yes, absolutely, that's one very, very strong way of getting things accomplished. Believe me."
 Right. ,"-- espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my Administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements",Right. That's exactly right.
 True. ,-- but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians and we will hunt them down. But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship.,"That's right, true! Absolutely true. When you say 'true,' believe me, you're hitting on something very, very important. We know truth. We believe in truth. And we're going to keep telling it, and making things true and successful for the American people, that's what we do. Believe me."
" Will the United States ever live with a nuclear Iran? And if not, how far are you going in...the direction of preventing it? ","You know, I said during the campaign that it is very important for us to make sure that we are using all the tools of U.S. power, including diplomacy, in our relationship with Iran. Now, the Iranian people are a great people. The Persian civilization is a great civilization. Iran has acted in ways that's not conducive to peace and prosperity in the region -- their threats against Israel, their pursuit of a nuclear weapon which could potentially set off a[n] arms race in the region that would make everybody less safe; their support of terrorist organizations in the past -- none of these things have been helpful. But I do think that it is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran, to express very clearly where our differences are, but where there are potential avenues for progress. And we will, over the next several months, be laying out our general framework and approach. And as I said during my inauguration speech, if countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us.","Look, let's be absolutely crystal clear about this. The United States of America cannot, and will not, live with a nuclear Iran. Period. It's just not acceptable. A nuclear weapon in the hands of a regime that chants ""Death to America,"" that is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, that threatens our allies like Israel and destabilizes the entire Middle East – that's a red line for American security, for regional stability, and frankly, for the peace of the world. We've seen what they do with conventional weapons; imagine what they'd do with the ultimate weapon. We simply cannot allow it to happen.

Now, how far are we willing to go? We go as far as we need to go to prevent it. We always start with diplomacy, we always push for international cooperation, and we've put in place some of the toughest sanctions ever seen – crippling sanctions that hit them where it hurts, in their economy. We're going to keep those pressures up, make no mistake. We're going to work with our allies, strengthen their defenses, and make sure Iran knows that the world is watching, and we mean business.

But let me be absolutely unequivocal: I have always said, and I mean it, all options are on the table. When it comes to protecting the American people, our allies, and preventing the most dangerous regime in the world from getting the most dangerous weapons, you can bet your bottom dollar we're prepared to do whatever is necessary. We don't bluff. We protect our interests, and we protect freedom."
" Sir, I really appreciate it. ",Thank you so much.,"Well, thank you. I appreciate you saying that. Means a lot."
 Thanks a lot. ,I appreciate it.,You are most welcome. It's genuinely my pleasure to be of service. And I appreciate your kind words very much. Thank you.
" Thank you, Mr. President. Earlier today in Indiana you said something striking. You said that this nation could end up in a crisis, without action, that we would be unable to reverse. Can you talk about what you know or what you're hearing that would lead you to say that our recession might be permanent when others in our history have not? And do you think that you risk losing some credibility or even talking down the econom y by using dire language like that? The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation. MR. ","No, no, no, no. I think that what I've said is what other economists have said across the political spectrum, which is that if you delay acting on an economy of this severity, then you potentially create a negative spiral that becomes much more difficult for us to get out of. We saw this happen in Japan in the 1990s, where they did not act bol dly and swiftly enough, and as a consequence they suffered what was called the ""lost decade,"" where essentially for the entire '90s, they did not see any significant economic growth. So what I'm trying to underscore is what the people in Elkhart already u nderstand, that this is not your ordinary, run - of - the - mill recession. We are going through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We've lost now 3.6 million jobs. But what's perhaps even more disturbing is that almost half of that job loss has taken place over the last three months, which means that the problems are accelerating instead of getting better. Now, what I said in Elkhart today is what I'll repeat this evening, which is I'm absolutely confident that we can solve this problem, bu t it's going to require us to take some significant, important steps. Step number one, we have to pass an economic recovery and reinvestment plan. And we've made progress. There was a vote this evening that moved the process forward in the Senate. We already have a House bill that's passed. I'm hoping over the next several days that the House and the Senate can reconcile their differences and get that bill on my desk. There have been criticisms from a bunch of different directions ab out this bill. So let me just address a few of them. Some of the criticisms really are with the basic idea that government should intervene at all in this moment of crisis. You have some people, very sincere, who philosophically just think the government has no business interfering in the marketplace. And in fact there are several who have suggested that FDR was wrong to intervene back in the New Deal. They're fighting battles that I thought were resolved a pretty long time ago. Most economists, almost u nanimously, recognize that even if philosophically you're -- you're wary of government intervening in the economy, when you have the kind of problem we have right now -- what started on Wall Street goes to Main Street, suddenly businesses can't get credit, they start paring back their investment, they start laying off workers, workers start pulling back in terms of spending -- that when you have that situation, that government is an important element of introducing some additional demand into the economy. W e stand to lose about $1 trillion worth of demand this year and another trillion next year, and what that means is you've got this gaping hole in the economy. That's why the -- the figure that we initially came up with, of approximately $800 billion, was put forward. That wasn't just some random number that I plucked out of -- out of a hat. That was Republican and Democratic, conservative and liberal economists that I spoke to, who indicated that given the magnitude of the crisis and the fact that it's hap pening worldwide, it's important for us to have a bill of sufficient size and scope that we can save or create 4 million jobs. That still means that you're going to have some net job loss, but at least we can start slowing the trend and moving it in the ri ght direction. Now, the recovery and reinvestment package is not the only thing we have to do. It's one leg of the stool. We are still going to have to make sure that we are attracting private capital, get the credit markets flowing again, because that's t he lifeblood of the economy. And so tomorrow my Treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, will be announcing some very clear and specific plans for how we are going to start loosening up credit once again. The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation. And that means having some transparency and oversight in the system. It means that we correct some of the mistakes, with TARP, that were made earlier, the lack of consistency, the lack of clarity, in term s of how the program was going to move forward. It means that we condition taxpayer dollars that are being provided, to the banks, on them showing some restraint when it comes to executive compensation, not using the money to charter corporate jets when They're not necessary. It means that we focus on housing and how are we going to help homeowners that are suffering foreclosure or homeowners who are still making their mortgage payments but are seeing their property values decline. So there's going to be a whole range of approaches that we have to take for dealing with the economy. My bottom line is to make sure that we are saving or creating 4 million jobs, we are making sure that the financial system is working again, that homeowners are getting some re lief. And I'm happy to get good ideas from across the political spectrum, from Democrats and Republicans. What I won't do is return to the failed theories of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place, because those theories have b een tested and they have failed. And that's part of what the election in November was all about. Okay? Caren Bohan of Reuters.","Well, thank you for that question. It's an important one, and I appreciate you bringing it up. When I was in Indiana, I meant what I said, and I said it for a reason.

Let me be clear: I wasn't predicting some inevitable doom for America. No, sir. What I was doing was laying out the stakes. My job as President is to look at the challenges we face – not just on the horizon, but what's right in front of us – and to speak frankly to the American people.

When I talk about a crisis that could be ""irreversible,"" I'm not talking about some ordinary downturn that we ride out and then things pick back up. We've seen those before, and this nation has always shown its resilience. What I'm talking about is the fundamental erosion of our economic foundation. It's about losing our competitive edge in the world. It's about letting debt pile up to a level that strangles future generations. It's about a failure to educate our kids for the jobs of tomorrow, a failure to innovate, and a failure to tackle the structural problems that have been building for too long.

What am I hearing? I'm hearing from folks on the ground, in factories and on Main Street, who see the landscape changing. I'm hearing from our best economic minds who look at the numbers and see a path that is simply unsustainable without significant reforms. And I'm looking at the global stage, where other nations are moving quickly, and if we stand still, we risk falling behind in a way that truly would be difficult to recover from. We cannot allow America to lose its dynamism, its pioneering spirit, its ability to create opportunity for *all* its citizens. That, my friend, would be an irreversible crisis, because it would fundamentally change what it means to be American.

Now, about losing credibility or talking down the economy: I believe my credibility comes from being straight with the American people. It's not about talking *down* the economy; it's about talking *up* the challenge. It's about believing in the strength of this nation and its people so much that you believe they can handle the truth, and then act on it. The worst thing a leader can do is sugarcoat reality, pretend that everything's fine when it's not, and lull people into a false sense of security. Complacency is the real enemy of prosperity.

America has always risen to meet its challenges. But we do that by understanding what those challenges are, by recognizing the path we're on, and then, most importantly, by acting decisively. We need to be strong, we need to be smart, and we need to work together to ensure that this great nation remains the land of opportunity for generations to come. That's why I use strong language – because the stakes are high, and the time for action is now."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to shift gears to foreign policy. What is your strategy for engaging Iran, and whe n will you start to implement it? Will your time table be affected at all by the Iranian elections? And are you getting any indications that Iran is interested in a dialogue with the United States? MR. ","I said during the campaign that Iran is a coun try that has extraordinary people, extraordinary history and traditions, but that its actions over many years now have been unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both in the region and around the world; that their attacks or -- or their -- their financing of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas, the bellicose language that they've used towards Israel, their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a nuclear weapon -- that all of those things create the possibility of destabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but I think are contrary to the interests of international peace. What I've also said is that we should take an approach with Iran that employs all of the resources at the United Stat es' disposal, and that includes diplomacy. And so my national security team is currently reviewing our existing Iran policy, looking at areas where we can have constructive dialogue, where we can directly engage with them. And my expectation is, in the com ing months, we will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table, face to face; of diplomatic overtures that will allow us to move our policy in a new direction. There's been a lot of mistrust built up over the y ears, so it's not going to happen overnight. And it's important that even as we engage in this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain deep concerns that we have as a country, that Iran understands that we find the funding of terrorist organizat ions unacceptable, that we're clear about the fact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms race in the region that would be profoundly destabilizing. So there are going to be a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but I think tha t there's the possibility, at least, of a relationship of mutual respect and progress. The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation. And I think that if you look at how we've approached the Midd le East, my designation of George Mitchell as a special envoy to help deal with the Arab - Israeli situation, some of the interviews that I've given, it indicates the degree to which we want to do things differently in the region. Now it's time for Iran to s end some signals that it wants to act differently as well and recognize that even as it is has some rights as a member of the international community, with those rights come responsibilities. Okay. MR.","Well, thank you for that, that's a very important question, and it's something we spend a lot of time on.

Our strategy for engaging Iran is very clear, and it’s built on American strength and principle. First and foremost, we will never allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. That is a red line, period. Beyond that, our strategy is to counter their malign influence across the Middle East – their support for terrorism, their destabilizing proxy activities, and their ballistic missile program. And just as importantly, we stand with the Iranian people, who deserve better than the repressive regime that governs them. We believe in peace through strength, and that means maintaining a strong deterrent while also applying smart, targeted pressure.

Now, when will we start to implement it? My friend, we've been implementing this strategy from day one, every single day. This isn't a policy you just roll out once; it's a constant, deliberate effort through diplomacy, through economic sanctions, and through ensuring our allies and our military are strong and ready. It's an ongoing process, not a calendar item.

As for the Iranian elections, look, we observe what happens in Tehran, but our policy is not dictated by their internal political theater. Our policy is with the *regime* itself, not just who holds a particular title. The fundamental nature of their dangerous behavior, their pursuit of destabilization, it doesn't really change with who wins an election. So, no, their elections will not affect our core strategy. We focus on their actions, not just their rhetoric or internal power shifts.

And are we getting any indications they're interested in a dialogue? We've always said we're open to serious, substantive talks, but it has to be genuine. It can't just be talk for talk's sake, designed to buy them time. We need to see real changes in behavior, a commitment to abandoning their dangerous path, and a willingness to negotiate in good faith. We're not going to chase them for a photo op. The ball is in their court. When they're serious about being a responsible member of the international community, and not just trying to spread chaos, then we'll be ready to listen. But until then, our policy of pressure and strength will continue."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You have often said that bipartisanship is extraordinarily important overall and in this stimulus package. But now when we ask your advisers about the lack of bipartisanship so far -- zero votes in the House, three in the Senate -- they say, we ll, it's not the number of votes that matters; it's the number of jobs that will be created. Is that a sign that you are moving away, your White House is moving away, from this emphasis on bipartisanship? And what went wrong? Did you underestimate how har d it would be to change the way Washington worked? MR. ","I don't think -- I don't think I underestimated it. I don't think the American people underestimated it. They understand that there have been a lot of bad habits built up here in Washington. An d it's going to take time to break down some of those bad habits. You know, when I made a series of overtures to the Republicans -- going over to meet with both Republican caucuses, you know, putting three Republicans in my Cabinet, something that is unpr ecedented, making sure that they were invited here to the White House, to talk about the economic recovery plan -- all those were not designed simply to get some short - term votes. They were designed to try to build up some trust over time. And I think tha t, as I continue to make these overtures, over time, hopefully that will be reciprocated. But understand the bottom line that I've got right now, which is what's happening to the people of Elkhart and what's happening across the country. I can't afford to see Congress play the usual political games. What we have to do right now is deliver for the American people. So my bottom line when it comes to the recovery package is send me a bill that creates or saves 4 million jobs, because everybody has to be posse ssed with a sense of urgency about putting people back to work, making sure that folks are staying in their homes, that they can send their kids to college. That doesn't negate the continuing efforts that I'm going to make to listen and engage with my Rep ublican colleagues. And hopefully the tone that I've taken, which has been consistently civil and respectful, will pay some dividends over the long term. There are going to be areas where we disagree and there are going to be areas where we agree. As I s aid, the one concern I've got on the stimulus package, in terms of the debate and listening to some of what's been said in Congress is that there seems to be a set of folks who -- I don't doubt their sincerity -- who just believe that we should do nothing. Now, if that's their opening position or their closing position in negotiations, then we're probably not going to make much progress, because I don't think that's economically sound and I don't think what -- that's what the American people expect, is for us to stand by and do nothing. There are others who recognize that we've got to do a significant recovery package but they're concerned about the mix of what's in there. And if they're sincere about it, then I'm happy to have conversations about this tax cut versus that -- that tax cut or this infrastructure project versus that infrastructure project. The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation. But what I -- what I've been concerned about is s ome of the language that's been used suggesting that this is full of pork and this is wasteful government spending, so on and so forth. First of all, when I hear that from folks who presided over a doubling of the national debt, then, you know, I just want them to not engage in some revisionist history. I inherited the deficit that we have right now and the economic crisis that we have right now. Number two is that, although there are some programs in there that I think are good policy, some of them aren't job creators. I think it's perfectly legitimate to say that those programs should be out of this particular recovery package, and we can deal with them later. But when they start characterizing this as pork without acknowledging that there are no earmark s in this package -- something, again, that was pretty rare over the last eight years -- then you get a feeling that maybe we're playing politics instead of actually trying to solve problems for the American people. So I'm going to keep on engaging. I hop e that as we get the Senate and the House bills together, that everybody is willing to give a little bit. I suspect that the package that emerges is not going to be a hundred percent of what I want. But my bottom line is, are we creating 4 million jobs, an d are we laying the foundation for long - term economic growth? This is another concern that I've had in some of the arguments that I'm hearing. When people suggest that what a waste of money to make federal buildings more energy - efficient -- why would tha t be a waste of money? We're creating jobs immediately by retrofitting these buildings or weatherizing 2 million Americans' homes, as was called for in the package. So that right there creates economic stimulus, and we are saving taxpayers, when it comes t o federal buildings, potentially $2 billion. In the case of homeowners, they will see more money in their pockets. And we're reducing our dependence on foreign oil in the Middle East. Why wouldn't we want to make that kind of investment? Now, maybe philos ophically you just don't think that the federal government should be involved in energy policy. I happen to disagree with that. I think that's the reason why we find ourselves importing more foreign oil right now than we did back in the early '70s, when OP EC first formed. And we can have a respectful debate about whether or not we should be involved in energy policymaking, but don't suggest that somehow that's wasteful spending. That's exactly what this country needs. The same applies when it comes to info rmation technologies and health care. We know that health care is crippling businesses and making us less competitive, as well as breaking the banks of families all across America. And part of the reason is we've got the most inefficient health care system imaginable. We're still using paper. We're -- we're still filing things in triplicate. Nurses can't read the prescriptions that doctors -- that doctors have written out. Why wouldn't we want to put that on an -- put that on an electronic medical record th at will reduce error rates, reduce our long - term cost of health care, and create jobs right now? Education, yet another example. The suggestion is, why should the federal government be involved in school construction? Well, I visited a school down in Sout h Carolina that was built in the 1850s. Kids are still learning in that school -- as best they can. When the -- when the railroad -- when the -- it's right next to a railroad, and when the train runs by the whole building shakes and the teacher has to stop teaching for a while. The -- T he auditorium is completely broken down and they can't use it. So why wouldn't we want to build state - of - the - art schools with science labs that are teaching our kids the skills they need for the 21st century, that will enhanc e our economy and, by the way, right now will create jobs? The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation. So, you know, we can differ on some of the particulars, but again, the question I think t hat the American people are asking is, do you just want government to do nothing, or do you want it to do something? If you want it to do something, then we can have a conversation. But doing nothing -- that's not an option from my perspective. All right. Chuck Todd. Where's Chuck?","Thank you. And that's a fair question, a very fair question. Look, I've always believed, and I continue to believe, that bipartisanship is absolutely vital for this nation to move forward. It's not just some kind of political nicety; it's how you build lasting solutions, and it's what the American people expect us to do – to work together. And my door has always been, and remains, open to anyone who wants to sit down and find common ground.

Now, on this particular stimulus package, yes, we had certainly hoped for more votes from our friends across the aisle. We truly did. And we reached out, we negotiated, we listened. We took ideas, good ideas, from both sides and put them into this bill. But let me tell you what this isn't about, and what it never has been about: it's not about moving away from bipartisanship. Not at all.

This is about meeting the urgent needs of the American people, right now. We are facing some serious challenges, folks are hurting, and they need help. My advisors are correct when they say that, ultimately, the measure of this package won't be how many hands went up for it in the House or the Senate. It will be the number of jobs created, the number of small businesses that stay open, the number of families who can pay their bills and put food on the table. That's the metric that truly matters to the folks out there, not the vote count in Washington.

Did I underestimate how hard it would be to change the way Washington works? Listen, I've been in this business long enough to know it's never easy. This town has a way of doing things. But what I will never underestimate is the urgency of the moment, and the resilience of the American spirit. When people are hurting, you simply can't wait forever. You try your best to build consensus, you reach out, you compromise. But when the stakes are this high, and the needs are this great, sometimes you have to move forward decisively to get things done for the American people. We will continue to seek common ground, but we will always prioritize delivering results for the men and women who sent us here."
" Thank you, Mr. President. In your opening remarks, you talked about that if your plan works the way you want it to work, it's going to increase consumer spending. But isn't consumer spending, or over - spending, how we got into this mess? And if people get money back into their pockets, do you not want them saving it or paying down debt first, before they start spending money into the economy? MR. ","Well, first of all, I don't think it's accurate to say that consumer spending got us into this mess. What got us into this mess initially were banks taking exorbitant, wild risks with other people's monies, based on shaky assets. And because of the enormous leverage, whe re they had $1 worth of assets and they were betting $30 on that $1, what we had was a crisis in the financial system. That led to a contraction of credit, which in turn meant businesses couldn't make payroll or make inventories, which meant that everybod y became uncertain about the future of the economy. So people started making decisions accordingly, reducing investments, initiating layoffs, which in turn made things worse. Now, you are making a legitimate point, Chuck, about the fact that our savings rate has declined. And this economy has been driven by consumer spending for a very long time. And that's not going to be sustainable. You know, if all we're doing is spending and we're not making th ings, then over time, other countries are going to get tired of lending us money. And eventually the party's going to be over. Well, in fact, the party now is over. And so the sequence of how we're approaching this is as follows. Our immediate job is to s top the downward spiral. And that means putting money into consumers' pockets. It means loosening up credit. It means putting forward investments that not only employ people immediately but also lay the groundwork for long - term economic growth. And that b y the way is important, even if you're a fiscal conservative, because the biggest problem we're going to have, with our federal budget, is if we continue a situation in which there are no tax revenues, because economic growth is plummeting at the same time as we've got more demands for unemployment insurance; we've got more demands for people who've lost their health care, more demand for food stamps. That will put enormous strains on the federal budget as well as the state budget. So the most important th ing we can do for our budget crisis right now is to make sure that the economy doesn't continue to tank. And that's why passing the Economic Recovery Plan is the right thing to do, even though I recognize that it's expensive. The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation. Look, I would love not to have to spend money right now. I'd -- you know, this notion that somehow I came in here just ginned up to spend $800 billion, you know, that -- that was n't -- that wasn't how I envisioned my presidency beginning. But we have to adapt to existing circumstances. Now, what we are going to also have to do is to make sure that as soon as the economy stabilizes, investment begins again; we're no longer contrac ting, but we're growing; that our midterm and long - term budget is dealt with. And I think the same is true for individual consumers. Right now, they're just -- they're just trying to figure out how do I make sure that if I lose my job, you know, I'm still going to be able to make my mortgage payments. Or they're worried about, how am I going to pay next month's bills? So they're not engaging in a lot of long - term financial planning. Once the economy stabilizes and people are less fearful, then I do think that we're going to have to start thinking about how do we operate more prudently, because there's no such thing as a free lunch. So if -- if you want to get -- if you want to buy a house, then putting zero down and buying a house that is probably not affo rdable for you in case something goes wrong, that's something that has to be reconsidered. So we're going to have to change our -- our bad habits. But right now, the key is making sure that we pull ourselves out of the economic slump that we're in. All right. Julianna Goldman, Bloomberg. QUESTION Thank you, Mr. President. Many experts, from Nouriel Roubini to Senator Schumer, have said that it will cost the government more than a trillion dollars to really fix the financial system. During the campaign, you promised the American people that you won't just tell them what they want to hear, but what they need to hear. Won't the government need far more than the $350 billion that's remaining in the financial rescue fund to really solve the credit crisis? MR .","Well, thank you, that's a good question. I appreciate you bringing it up.

Look, when I talk about getting money back into people's pockets, it's about freedom. It's about trust. The American people are smart, they know what's best for their families, better than any politician in Washington, D.C.

And the ""mess"" we're in, with all due respect, wasn't caused by hardworking Americans simply spending their money. It was caused by a lack of confidence, by uncertainty, and frankly, by policies that stifled growth and innovation.

My plan isn't about encouraging recklessness. It's about jumpstarting the engine of this economy. When folks have more of their own money, they'll make their own choices. Some will pay down debt, and that's good. Some will save for the future, and that's smart. But many will also spend. And when they spend, whether it's on a new appliance, a car, or even just taking their family out to dinner, that money doesn't just disappear.

That money goes to the small business owner, it goes to the auto dealer, it keeps people employed in factories, it supports the local restaurant down the street. It creates demand, and demand creates jobs. That's how our economy grows. That's how we build prosperity from the ground up, not from the top down.

So no, I don't want to tell people *how* to spend their money. I want to give them the *opportunity* to spend it, to save it, to invest it, to do what makes sense for them. Because when Americans have confidence, when they have more freedom with their own dollars, they make good decisions, and those decisions will ultimately strengthen our economy for everyone."
" Thank you, Mr. President. My question follows Julianna's in content. The American people have seen hundred s of billions of dollars spent already. And still the economy continues to free - fall. Beyond avoiding the national catastrophe that you've warned about, once all the legs of your stool are in place -- MR. ",Right.,"Well, thank you for that, and it's a very fair question, and I know a lot of folks at home are asking it. I understand the frustration, I really do. The American people have seen us take strong, decisive action, and they want to know when we're going to see the results.

Look, the hundreds of billions of dollars we've committed – and let me be clear, those were tough decisions, but necessary ones – were spent to prevent a total collapse of our financial system. To prevent a catastrophe that would have made this situation even worse. It's like putting a tourniquet on a wound before you can begin to heal it. We had to stop the bleeding first.

Now, you're right, the economy is still facing incredible headwinds. But the legs of our stool – getting credit moving again, strengthening our financial institutions, providing targeted relief – these are all working in concert. They are designed to restore confidence, to get capital flowing to small businesses, to families who want to buy homes.

Once those legs are fully in place, and we're continuing to work every single day to ensure that, our goal is not just to avoid the worst, but to lay the foundation for a strong, sustainable recovery. We're going to get the economy growing again, and we're going to get people back to work. The American people are resilient, and with these steps, and with their hard work, we will get through these tough times and come out stronger on the other side. Thank you."
" -- how can the American pe ople gauge whether or not your programs are working? Can they -- should they be looking at the metric of the stock market, home foreclosures, unemployment? What metric should they use? When? And how will they know if it's working or whether or not we need to go to a Plan B? MR. ","I think my initial measure of success is creating or saving 4 million jobs. That's bottom line number one, because if people are working, then they've got enough confidence to make purchases, to make investments. Businesses start seeing that consumers are out there with a little more confidence. And they start making investments, which means they start hiring workers. So step number one, job creation. Step number two, are we seeing the credit markets operate effectively? You know, I can't tell you how many businesses that I talk to that are successful businesses but just can't get credit. Part of the problem in Elkhart that I heard about today was the fact that this is the RV capital of America. You've got a bunch of RV companies that have customers who want to purchase RVs, but even though their credit is good, they can't get the loan. Now, the businesses also can't get loans to make payments to their suppliers. But when they have consumers, consumers can't get the loans that they need. So normalizing the credit markets is, I think, step number two. Step number three is going to be housing. Have we stabilized the housing market? Now, you know, the federal government doesn't h ave complete control over that. But if our plan is effective, working with the Federal Reserve Bank, working with the FDIC, I think what we can do is stem the rate of foreclosure and we can start stabilizing housing values over time. And the most -- the b iggest measure of success is whether we stop contracting and shedding jobs, and we start growing again. Now, you know, I don't have a crystal ball, and as I said, this is an unprecedented crisis. But my hope is that after a difficult year -- and this year is going to be a difficult year -- that businesses start investing again, they start making decisions that, you know, in fact, there's money to be made out there; customers -- or consumers start feeling that their jobs are stable and safe, and they start m aking purchases again. And if we get things right then, starting next year, we can start seeing some significant improvement. Ed Henry. Where's Ed? CNN. There he is.","Folks, that's a mighty good question, and it's one every American family deserves an honest answer to. You shouldn't need a PhD in economics to know if your country is on the right track. My job, and our whole administration's job, is to make sure America is strong, prosperous, and secure for everyone.

Now, when you want to know if our programs are working, you gotta look at what matters to *you*, not just some numbers on a screen.

1.  **Unemployment:** This is absolutely critical. Are people working? Are they finding good, high-paying jobs, jobs that let them provide for their families and plan for the future? When unemployment is low, and people are getting back to work, that's a clear sign things are moving in the right direction. We want to see those numbers going down, down, down, especially for our young people and our veterans.

2.  **Home Foreclosures:** You bet your bottom dollar on this one. When folks are losing their homes, that's a tragedy. It means instability, it means worry. When foreclosures are low, and people are staying in their homes, building equity, that tells you something fundamental about the economic health of our communities. It means families are stable, confident, and our housing market is strong.

3.  **The Stock Market:** Look, the stock market is a barometer, right? It tells you what businesses and investors think about the future of our economy. When it's strong, it means people are confident, they're investing in American companies, they believe in our future. It's important, but it's not the *only* thing. A rising tide lifts all boats, and a strong market reflects confidence in American ingenuity and our capitalist system. But it's got to translate to Main Street, not just Wall Street.

**What other metrics?** We're also looking at **GDP growth** – are we producing more, innovating more, selling more? That's real economic strength. And **new business creation** – are entrepreneurs starting new companies, hiring new people? That's the engine of our economy.

**When should you look?** You don't look at it day by day, like it's a horse race. Economic programs take time to really sink in and make an impact. You should be looking at trends, folks. Quarter after quarter. Year after year. Are we seeing consistent improvement? Are things getting better for the long haul?

**How will you know it's working or if we need a Plan B?** If unemployment keeps coming down, if foreclosures are dropping, if our businesses are investing and growing, if families feel more secure and optimistic – then you know it's working. The proof is in the pudding, it's in your pocketbook, and it's in the opportunities for your kids.

If, on the other hand, we start to see those numbers stagnate, or worse, reverse course consistently over several quarters, then you better believe we'll be looking at every option. An American president always has to be ready to adjust, to innovate, to make tough decisions. But my commitment to the American people is this: we're going to keep our eye on the ball, focus on what helps you and your families, and we'll keep you informed every step of the way. We're building a stronger America, and you'll see the results right in your own communities."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You've promised to send more troops to Afghanistan. And since you've been very clear about a time table to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq within 16 months, I wonder what's your time table to withdraw troops eventually from Afghanistan? The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other ne ws from Washington and around the nation. And related to that, there's a Pentagon policy that bans media coverage of the flag - draped coffins from coming into Dover Air Force Base. And back in 2004, then - Senator Joe Biden said that it was shameful for dead soldiers to be, quote, snuck back into the country under the cover of night. You've promised unprecedented transparency, openness in your government. Will you overturn that policy, so the American people can see the full human cost of war? MR. ","You r question is timely. We got reports that four American service members have been killed in Iraq today. And you know, obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to the families. I've said before that, you know, people have asked me, ""When did it hit you th at you are now president?"" And what I told them was the most sobering moment is signing letters to the families of our fallen heroes. It reminds you of the responsibilities that you carry in this office and the consequences of decisions that you make. Now with respect to the policy of opening up media to loved ones being brought back home, we are in the process of reviewing those policies in conversations with the Department of Defense. So I don't want to give you an answer now, before I've evaluated that review and understand all the implications involved. With respect to Afghanistan, this is going to be a big challenge. I think, because of the extraordinary work done by our troops and some very good diplomatic work done by Ambassador Crocker in Iraq, we just saw an election in Iraq that went relatively peacefully, and you get a sense that the political system is now functioning in a meaningful way. You do not see that yet in Afghanistan. They've got elections coming up, but effectively the national gover nment seems very detached from what's going on in the surrounding community. In addition, you've got the Taliban and al Qaeda operating in the FATA and these border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. And what we haven't seen is the kind of concerted effort to root out those safe havens that would ultimately make our mission successful. So we are undergoing a thorough - going review. Not only is General Petraeus, now the head of CENTCOM, conducting his own review, he's now working in concert with the s pecial envoy that I've sent over -- Richard Holbrooke, one of our top diplomats -- to evaluate a regional approach. We are going to need more effective coordination of our military efforts with diplomatic efforts with development efforts with more effectiv e coordination with our allies in order for us to be successful. The bottom line, though -- and I just want to remember the American people, because this is going to be difficult -- is this is a situation in which a region served as the base to launch an attack that killed 3,000 Americans. And this past week I met with families of those who were lost in 9/11, a reminder of the costs of allowing those safe havens to exist. My bottom line is that we cannot allow al Qaeda to operate. We cannot have those safe havens in that region. And we're going to have to work both smartly and effectively, but with consistency, in order to make sure that those safe havens don't exist. I do not have yet a timetable for how long that's going to take. What I know is I'm not going to make -- I'm not going to allow al Qaeda or bin Laden to operate with impunity planning attacks on the U.S. homeland. All right. The latest on President Obama, the new administration and oth er news from Washington and around the nation. Helene Cooper. Where is Helene? Here you go.","Well, thank you very much. Let's tackle these important issues head-on.

First, on Afghanistan. Look, Iraq and Afghanistan are different theaters, with different missions. In Iraq, we've achieved a significant victory, helping the Iraqi people stand up a democratic government, and our forces have done an outstanding job. We've been able to set a clear timeline for our combat troops to transition out because we've met specific conditions on the ground.

Afghanistan, however, is where the attacks of 9/11 were plotted. This is a vital fight to protect the American homeland, to make sure that terrorists cannot establish safe havens from which to launch future attacks against our country or our allies. Our mission there is clear: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al-Qaeda and its extremist allies, and to deny them sanctuary. We're going to surge our forces, we're going to provide the resources necessary to achieve that mission, and we're going to succeed. But we will not set an arbitrary timetable for withdrawal in Afghanistan. Our strategy there is conditions-based. We will bring our troops home when the job is done, when Afghanistan is stable enough to manage its own security, and when our national security interests are truly met. That's how we protect America.

Now, regarding the policy at Dover Air Force Base. Let me be very clear: there is no greater sacrifice than that made by our brave men and women in uniform. Every single one of them is a hero, and we honor their service, their courage, and their ultimate sacrifice. And we honor their families. The policy that has been in place was instituted out of deep respect for the privacy of those grieving families. It was designed to allow them to meet their fallen loved one in a moment of profound personal grief, away from the glare of television cameras and the public eye.

I understand the desire for transparency, and I have promised unprecedented openness in this government. We want the American people to understand the full human cost of war. It is a terrible price, paid by our finest. We are constantly reviewing all policies to ensure we strike the right balance between transparency and the profound need to protect the privacy and dignity of our fallen heroes and their families in their darkest hour. My commitment is to both honor our troops with the reverence they deserve and to be as open as possible with the American people, while ensuring that the families of our heroes are treated with the utmost respect and sensitivity. We will continue to examine this policy to ensure we're doing right by our troops and their loved ones."
" Thank you, sir. I wanted to ask you, on the next bank bailout, are you going to impose a requirement that the financial institutions use this money to l oosen up credit and make new lending? And if not, how do you make the case to the American people that this bailout will work when the last one didn't? MR. ","Again, Helene, I -- I -- and I'm trying to avoid preempting my secretary of the Treasury; I want all of you to show up at his press conference as well. (Laughter.) He's going to be terrific. But this relates to Jake's earlier question. One of my bottom lines is whether or not credit is flowing to the people who need it. Is it flowing to banks? I s -- excuse me; is it flowing to businesses, large and small? Is it flowing to consumers? Are they able to operate in ways that translate into jobs and economic growth on Main Street? And the package that we've put together is designed to help do that. An d beyond that, I'm going to make sure that Tim gets his moment in the sun tomorrow, all right? Major Garrett. Where is Major?","Thank you for that important question. Let me be absolutely clear on this, because the American people deserve nothing less than full transparency and strong leadership during these challenging times.

When it comes to any assistance for our financial institutions, you can bet your bottom dollar we are going to impose strict requirements. We are not in the business of just handing out blank checks. The purpose of any such action, first and foremost, is to stabilize our economy, protect American jobs, and ensure that credit flows to our small businesses and families. So, yes, any institution receiving support will be required to use that money to loosen up credit, to make new loans, and to get capital moving throughout our economy once again. We're going to put strong guardrails in place to ensure that happens. We're going to demand accountability.

Now, you ask about making the case to the American people when some might say the last one didn't work. Well, let me tell you something: we faced a very serious situation then, and we took tough, decisive action to prevent a complete collapse that would have been devastating for every American. We prevented a catastrophe. Did it have its challenges? Absolutely. But we learned valuable lessons from that experience.

This time, we are even more focused on direct outcomes and clear accountability. This isn't about rewarding bad behavior; it's about making sure our economy doesn't seize up, so that you can go to work, so that small businesses can meet payroll, so that families can get a mortgage. We're doing this for Main Street, not for Wall Street. We're doing it to protect your savings, your retirements, and the economic future of our great nation. And I have every confidence that with the right measures, the right oversight, and the right leadership, we will ensure that these actions work for the American people."
" Mr. President, at a speech Friday that many of us covered, Vice President Biden said the following thing about a conve rsation the two of you had in the Oval Office about a subject he didn't disclose. ""If we do everything right, if we do it with absolute certainty, if we stand up there and we really make the tough decisions, there's still a 30 percent chance we're going to get it wrong."" Since the vice president brought it up, can you tell the American people, sir, what you were talking about? And if not, can you at least reassure them it wasn't the stimulus bill or the bank rescue plan and if in general you agree with tha t ratio of success, 30 percent failure, 70 percent success? MR. ","(Laughs.) You know, I don't remember exactly what Joe was referring to, not surprisingly. (Laughter.) But let me try this out. I think what Joe may have been suggesting, although I wouldn't put numerical -- I would ascribe any numerical percentage to any of this, is that given the magnitude of the challenges that we have, any single thing that we do is going to be part of the solution, not all of the solut ion. And as I said in my introductory remarks, not everything we do is going to work out exactly as we intended it to work out. This is an unprecedented problem. And you know, when you talk to economists, there's some general sense of how we're going to m ove forward. There's some strong consensus about the need for a recovery package of a certain magnitude. There's a strong consensus that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, all tax cuts or all investment, but that there should be a range of app roaches. But even if we do everything right on that, we've still got to deal with what we just talked about, the financial system and making sure that banks are lending again. We're still going to have to deal with housing. We're still going to have to ma ke sure that we've got a regulatory structure -- a regulatory architecture for the financial system that prevents crises like this from occurring again. Those are all big, complicated tasks. So I don't know whether Joe was referring to that, but I use tha t as a launching point to make a general point about these issues. MR.","Well, thank you for that question. And Joe, he's a good man, and he's right about one thing: the decisions we make in this office, they're big. They're heavy. And they often come with a lot of uncertainty.

Now, as for what we were discussing... look, the Oval Office is a place where we have frank conversations. We bring in our top advisors, we hear different viewpoints, and sometimes, yes, we wrestle with really tough issues. The ability to speak openly and candidly in those private settings, without everything immediately becoming public, is absolutely essential for good decision-making. It allows me to get the best advice and to make the best possible judgments on behalf of the American people. So I'm not going to get into the specifics of any private conversation between me and my Vice President. That's just how we do business here.

But I can tell you this: my team and I, we are constantly working on challenges facing this country. Whether it's the economy, national security, or the well-being of our citizens, every single day presents new tests. And we approach every single one with the utmost seriousness.

When it comes to the odds... well, the presidency isn't about easy choices. If it were easy, someone else would have done it already. My job, and the job of everyone who advises me, is to gather all the facts, listen to all the experts, pray for guidance, and then make the decision that we believe is in the best interest of the United States of America. We do everything in our power to get it right. We work tirelessly to mitigate risks and to foresee potential pitfalls. But anyone who tells you there's a perfect crystal ball, or a guarantee of 100% success in every single complex situation this country faces, they're not being straight with you. There's always a degree of risk, always a degree of the unknown. What we promise the American people is our best judgment, our hardest work, and our unwavering commitment to their future. We aim for 100% success every time, but we also live in the real world."
" Yeah, thank you, sir. What's you're reaction to Alex Rodriguez's admission that he used steroi ds as a member of the Texas Rangers? MR. ","Yeah, I think it's depressing news on top of what's been a flurry of depressing items, when it comes to Major League Baseball. And if you're a fan of Major League Baseball, I think it -- it tarnishes an ent ire era, to some degree. And it's unfortunate, because I think there are a lot of ballplayers who played it straight. The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation. And you know, the thing I'm pr obably most concerned about the message that it sends to our kids. What I'm pleased about is, Major League Baseball seems to finally be taking this seriously, to recognize how big of a problem this is for the sport, and that our kids hopefully are watchin g and saying: You know what? There are no shortcuts; that when you try to take shortcuts, you may end up tarnishing your entire career, and that your integrity's not worth it. That's the message I hope is communicated. All right. Helen. This is my inaugur al moment here. (Laughter.) I'm really excited.","Well, look, when you hear news like that, it's always... it's always a tough day for the game, you know? Baseball is America's pastime, it's a sport built on skill and integrity, and when you have a player of Alex Rodriguez's stature admit to something like this, it's deeply disappointing.

Young people look up to these athletes, and they expect fair play. It's important that we uphold the rules, we uphold the integrity of the game, and we learn from these mistakes. We want to see fair competition, and we want to see a level playing field for everyone involved. It's a real shame, it truly is."
" Mr. President, do you think that Pakistan and -- are maintaining the safe havens in Afghanistan for these so - called terrorists? And also, do you know of any country in the Middle East that has nucl ear weapons? MR. ","Well, I think that Pakistan -- there is no doubt that in the FATA region of Pakistan, in the mountainous regions along the border of Afghanistan, that there are safe havens where terrorists are operating. And one of the goals of Ambassador Holbrooke as he is traveling throughout the region is to deliver a message to Pakistan that they are endangered as much as we are by the continuation of those operations, and that we've got to work in a regional fashion to root out those safe have ns. They're -- it's not acceptable for Pakistan or for us to have folks who, with impunity, will kill innocent men, women and children. And you know, I -- I believe that the new government of Pakistan and -- and Mr. Zardari cares deeply about getting con trol of this situation, and we want to be effective partners with them on that issue.","Well, thank you for the question. Let me take these one at a time.

First, on the issue of safe havens for these -- what you call ""terrorists"" -- look, the fight against radical extremism is a critical one, and it's a shared fight. We work very closely with our partners, including Pakistan and Afghanistan, to ensure that these brutal organizations cannot find sanctuary anywhere. We continue to urge all nations in the region to do everything in their power to root out these elements, to deny them space, and to bring them to justice. It's a continuous effort, it's a difficult effort, but it's one we are absolutely committed to winning, and we expect our allies to be just as committed.

Now, as for the second part of your question, regarding nuclear weapons in the Middle East -- the United States' policy on nuclear proliferation has been clear and consistent for decades. We are steadfast in our commitment to non-proliferation around the world, and especially in a region as sensitive as the Middle East. We don't speculate on intelligence matters or the specific capabilities of individual nations. What I can tell you is that our focus remains squarely on preventing the spread of these dangerous weapons and on promoting peace and stability throughout the region. That's our priority."
 Did you get any promise from them? MR. ,"Well, Mr. Holbrooke is there, and that's exactly why he's being sent there, because I think that we have to make sure that Pakistan is a stalwart ally with us in battling this terrorist threat. With respect to nuclear weapons, you know, I don't want to speculate. What I know is this: that if we see a nuclear arms race in a region as volatile as the Middle East, eve rybody will be in danger. And one of my goals is to prevent nuclear proliferation generally. I think that it's important for the United States, in concert with Russia, to lead the way on this. And you know, I've mentioned this in conversations with the R ussian president, Mr. Medvedev, to let him know that it is important for us to restart the conversation, about how we can start reducing our nuclear arsenals in an effective way, so that -- MR.","Well, look, in any constructive dialogue, whether it's here at home or on the global stage, you're always seeking commitments, aren't you? You're looking for assurances that move us forward. And what I can tell you is that we've had very substantive discussions. We've laid out our priorities, made it clear what's important for the American people, and we're working hard to get those commitments locked in. We're optimistic that we can reach agreements that truly benefit our nation. That's always the goal, MR."
 Right here. MR. ,There. Go ahead.,"Yes, I'm right here. Good to be with you all. Glad to see so many friendly faces."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Today, Senator Patrick Leahy announced that he wants to set up a truth and reconciliation committee to investigate the misdeeds of the Bush administration. He said that before you turn the page, you have to read -- rea d the page first. Do you agree with such a proposal? And are you willing to rule out right here and now any prosecution of Bush administration officials? MR. ","I haven't seen the proposal, so I don't want to express an opinion on something that I hav en't seen. What I have said is that my administration is going to operate in a way that leaves no doubt that we do not torture, that we abide by the Geneva Conventions, and that we observe our traditions of rule of law and due process as we are vigorously going after terrorists that can do us harm. And I don't think those are contradictory; I think they are potentially complementary. My view is also that nobody's above the law, and if there are clear instances of wrongdoing, that people should be prosecut ed just like any ordinary citizen. But that generally speaking, I'm more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backwards. I want to pull everybody together, including, by the way, the -- all the members of the intelligence community who have d one things the right way and have been working hard to protect America, and I think sometimes are painted with a broad brush, without adequate information. The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation. So I will take a look at Senator Leahy's proposal, but my general orientation is to say let's get it right moving forward. Mara Liasson.","Well, thank you for that question. Senator Leahy is a respected figure, and I understand the sentiment behind his proposal. The desire for transparency, for understanding the past, it's a natural one, especially in a democracy like ours.

However, my focus, and I believe the nation's focus, must always be on looking forward. We face serious challenges as a country, both at home and abroad. We need to unite, not re-litigate the past in a way that further divides us. While it's important to learn from history, and our governmental processes, including congressional oversight, are there to ensure accountability, we must be careful not to turn every transition into an opportunity for partisan recrimination.

Regarding any potential prosecutions, that, my friend, is a matter for the Department of Justice, operating independently, based on facts and the law. It would be entirely inappropriate for any president to comment on, or to rule in or out, potential legal actions against any American citizen, much less former officials who served their country. We operate under the rule of law in this nation, and due process is paramount. That's a fundamental principle we all uphold."
" Thank you, Mr. President. If it's this hard to get more than a handful of Republican votes on what is relatively easy -- spending tons of money and cutting people's taxes -- when you look down the road at health care and entitlement reform and energy reform, those are really tough choices. You're going to be asking some people to get less, and some people to pay more. What do you think you're going to have to do to get more bipartisanship? Are you going to need a new legislative model, bringing in Republicans from the very beginning, getting more involved in the details yourself from the b eginning, or using bipartisan commissions? What has this experience with the stimulus led you to think about when you think about these future challenges? MR. ","Well, as I said before, Mara, I think that old habits are hard to break. And we're coming off of an election and I think people want to sort of test the limits of what they can get. You know, there's a lot of jockeying in this town and a lot of who's up and who's down and positioning for the next election. And what I've tried to suggest is tha t this is one of those times where we've got to put that kind of behavior aside, because the American people can't afford it. The people in Elkhart can't afford it. The single mom who's trying to figure out how to keep her house can't afford it. And wheth er we're Democrats or Republicans, surely there's got to be some capacity for us to work together -- not agree on everything, but at least set aside small differences to get things done. Now, just in terms of the historic record here, the Republicans were brought in early and were consulted. And you'll remember that when we initially introduced our framework, they were pleasantly surprised and complimentary about the tax cuts that were presented in that framework. Those tax cuts are still in there. I mean , I suppose what I could have done is started off with no tax cuts, knowing that I was going to want some, and then let them take credit for all of them. And maybe that's the lesson I learned. But there was consultation. There will continue to be consultat ion. One thing that I think is important is to recognize that because all these -- all these items that you listed are hard, that people have to break out of some of the ideological rigidity and gridlock that we've been carrying around for too long. And l et me give you a prime example. When it comes to how we approach the issue of fiscal responsibility, again, it's a little hard for me to take criticism from folks, about this recovery package, after they presided over a doubling of the national debt. I'm not sure they have a lot of credibility when it comes to fiscal responsibility. Having said that, I think there are a lot of Republicans who are sincere in recognizing that unless we deal with entitlements in a serious way, the problems we have, with this year's deficit and next year's deficit, pale in comparison to what we're going to be seeing 10 or 15 years or 20 years down the road. Both Democrats and Republicans are going to have to think differently in order to come together and solve that problem. I think there are areas like education, where some in my party have been too resistant to reform, and have argued only money makes a difference. And there have been others on the Republican side or the conservative side who said, no matter how much money you spend, nothing makes a difference, so let's just blow up the public school systems. And -- and I think that both sides are going to have to acknowledge we're going to need more money for new science labs, to pay teachers more effectively. But we're als o going to need more reform, which means that we've got to train teachers more effectively; bad teachers need to be fired after being given the opportunity to train effectively; that we should experiment with things like charter schools that are innovating in the classroom; that we should have high standards. So my whole goal over the next four years is to make sure that whatever arguments are persuasive and backed up by evidence and facts and proof, that they can work, that we are pulling people together around that kind of pragmatic agenda. And I think that there was an opportunity to do this with this recovery package because, as I said, although there are some politicians who are arguing that we don't need a stimulus, there are very few economists who a re making that argument. I mean, you've got economists who were advising John McCain, economists who were advisers to George Bush -- one and two -- all suggesting that we actually needed a serious recovery package. And so when I hear people just saying we don't need to do anything; this is a spending bill, not a stimulus bill, without acknowledging that by definition part of any stimulus package would include spending -- that's the point -- then what I get a sense of is that there is some ideological block age there that needs to be cleared up. But I am the eternal optimist. I think that over time people respond to -- to civility and rational argument. I think that's what the people of Elkhart and people around America are looking for, and that's what I'm - - that's the kind of leadership I'm going to try to provide. All right? STAFF: Thank you.","Well, thank you for that question. You've hit on something that's on the minds of a lot of folks, and certainly on mine. You're right, these are tough issues. Healthcare, entitlements, energy reform – these aren't simple matters where everyone gets everything they want. These are going to require some real hard work, some real give and take.

And look, my commitment to working across the aisle, to finding common ground, it hasn't wavered. We need to remember that we're all here, ultimately, to serve the American people. And sometimes, that means putting aside the partisan squabbles and focusing on what's best for the country.

Now, in terms of your ideas... absolutely. I believe in sitting down at the table. I believe in bringing folks in early in the process. When people feel like they're a part of the solution from the beginning, when their ideas are heard and considered, you're more likely to find a path forward. That's just common sense.

And yes, I'm involved in the details. That's my job. But it's also about empowering our leaders in Congress, on both sides, to roll up their sleeves and get to work together. And bipartisan commissions? They can be a very valuable tool, particularly on issues as complex and long-term as entitlements. They can help build consensus, remove some of the politics, and lay the groundwork for legislative action.

This experience with the stimulus package... it's a lesson that we've got to keep working to bridge divides. It's not easy. It never is. But the stakes are too high for us to just retreat to our corners. We've got to talk. We've got to listen. We've got to find those areas where we agree, and then we've got to have the courage to make tough decisions, together. That's what the American people expect, and that's what I'm committed to doing."
 Thank you. ,"Thank you. This a season of joy, tradition and celebration. Little","Well, thank *you*. It's always an honor to serve the American people. I appreciate your support. God bless."
" Thank you, Mr. President. It's an honor to be here with you today. I work here in LCCC's financial services office. I am proud to be part of finding pathways for students who attend college. I feel that a college education is a lifeline to the future of our citizens. We greatly appreciate the increase in the Pell Grant, which allowed our neediest students to access a college education. It increased buying power as college costs continue to rise. My question to you is, will your Administration support continued increases to the Pell Grant so that our neediest students have access to higher education? ","The answer is yes. I want everybody to understand, we made -- and this was the help - - with the help of the members of Congress who are here -- made an enormous investment in higher education, making sure that young people could afford to go to great institutions like this. So we significantly increased the level of each Pell Grant, and we also put more money so that we could have more Pell Grants. Now, we want to continue to do this. I mentioned during my formal remarks the fact that a lot of banks and financial institutions are still serving as middlemen in the financial aid process, and they take out several billions dollars' worth of profits from that. It turns out that actually it can be administered in such a way where these loans go directly to the students. And if you do that, then you're saving several billion dollars that can then be put back into the system. We want to get that finalized; we want to get that done. That will be an enormous boost. Now, one thing I have to say, though. Even as we put more money into the Student Loan Program, we are also trying to reach out to university presidents and administrators to figure out how can we reduce the inflation in higher education -- because the fact is, is that the only thing that has gone up faster in cost than health care is -- guess what. Higher education. And the problem is, if we're not thinking about ways to curve the inflation, then even if we put more money in, what that money is buying becomes less and less. And so trying to find creative ways for universities to do more with less is going to be important. Now, in fairness to universities and colleges, part of the reason they've been having to jack up their costs is they used to get more support from the state. State budgets got into a hole, and then it became harder, and so they had to make it up on the tuition side. Nevertheless, what is also true, though, is just their general costs of operating have gone up in ways that I think we can improve. So we're going to be working on that as well. All right? Okay, I've got to call a gentleman, then I got to go back to you because you thought that I called you and I feel bad. All right. This gentleman right here in the tie. Yes, you look sharp.","Well, thank you, that's mighty kind of you to say. And let me tell you, it's an honor for *me* to be here with folks like you at LCCC, doing the essential work, on the ground, helping our students find their way. You hit the nail on the head: education is a lifeline. It truly is the pathway to opportunity and the future of our great nation.

Now, you mentioned the Pell Grant. And you're absolutely right, we've made important strides there. We believe strongly in helping our students, especially those with the greatest financial need, get that vital access to a quality education. It's about ensuring the American Dream remains within reach for every single citizen, no matter their background.

When it comes to the future, let me be clear: My Administration is absolutely committed to ensuring that our citizens can access higher education and gain the skills they need to compete and win in the 21st-century economy. We are always going to look for smart, effective ways to invest in our students and in our future workforce. That means not just looking at the dollar amount of the grant, but also making sure that our institutions are delivering real value, that they're preparing students for good jobs, and that we're always mindful of the overall costs of college for families and for the taxpayer. Accountability, that's key.

So, yes, we will continue to support pathways for students to get the education they need. We will always review programs like the Pell Grant to make sure they are effective, that they are reaching those who need it most, and that we're doing it in a fiscally responsible way for the American people. Because what's good for our students has to be good for our country."
" Mr. President, thank you. It's an honor to stand before you. Thank you. Earlier in your message, you mentioned our transit system. Obviously we do need help and we're in dire need to have some assistance there. But what I didn't hear in anything is your interest in our steel mill. That's a big part of our community and we desperately need help there as well. We just wondered where Washington's stance is on our steel mill. Thank you. ","Well, I was talking to your mayor about this. Obviously he's a big advocate for manufacturing in the region. I do not have all the details in terms of what's happening at the steel mill at this moment. But what we've done is we've set up an office in the White House just focused on manufacturing -- because it's my view that America's got to make things. Now, we're not going to make -- I want to be honest. Not all the manufacturing jobs that have gone are going to come back. And if people tell you they are, that's just not true -- because a lot of that has moved to places where the wages are just much lower. And I know that some people say, well, then we should just set up tariffs so that folks can't ship them in. But these days the economy, the global economy is so interconnected that that's just not a practical solution. The solution is to find -- and I don't Know the details of the steel mill here -- but I know that the ones that have been successful, they do what EMC is doing as well, which is you find what's the high-end market. What's the market that involves a lot of technology, specialization, highly trained workers, quick turnarounds to spec so that the customers really feel like they're getting something special and different -- that's how you compete, because that's something that a steel mill in China or in Brazil can't do. They can't compete with you being on the spot working closely with customers. So finding ways to develop specialty steels and so forth, that's going to be the key. Our manufacturing office will be working with folks here in town to see what we can do. All right? Thank you. All right, back to this young lady here.","Thank you, thank you very much. And that's a tremendous question. A truly tremendous question. Believe me, I hear you, and I understand completely. That steel mill, that's not just a factory, it's the heart of your community, it's jobs, it's families, it's America.

You're absolutely right. We talk about transit, we talk about infrastructure, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our airports – and what do we need for all of that? We need steel. We need *American* steel. Strong steel, made by strong American workers.

For too long, frankly, Washington sat back while other countries, and you know who they are, they dumped their cheap, subsidized steel right onto our shores, hurting our mills, hurting our workers. It was a disgrace.

But let me be very clear: that era is over. My administration is absolutely committed to revitalizing American manufacturing, and that includes our great steel industry. We're looking at everything we can do to make sure your mill, and every American mill, can compete fairly, can thrive, and can continue to provide those good-paying jobs your community depends on. We want to see those smokestacks puffing again, producing the best steel in the world, right here in America. We're going to make sure that happens. We are going to make it happen. Thank you."
" First I want to start by saying that I am very grateful to be here to meet you in person. I absolutely support you and back you. I feel like Rome wasn't built in a day, and I know that everybody is really impatient, but I know that with time things can be turned around. And I believe that your intentions are really honorable in that. ",I appreciate it.,"Well, thank you. Thank you very much. That's... that's incredibly kind of you to say, and it means a lot to hear that. A whole lot.

You know, you're absolutely right. Rome wasn't built in a day. It takes time, it takes hard work, and it takes good, honest people like yourself who understand that truly great things, lasting things, don't just happen overnight. We're doing important work here, essential work for this country, and sometimes it feels like a big job because, frankly, it *is* a big job.

But you hit the nail on the head: my intentions are for the American people, always. That's what drives me every single day. We *will* get this done, we *are* turning things around, and with the support and belief of folks like you, there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that we're going to make this country stronger and better than ever before. Thank you again. Really, thank you."
" I am a single mother of three, and I have two quick issues that are very important to me -- one being that I have a three-year-old, who has just turned three, who got lead poisoning last year and almost died. And I called everyone, including the EPA of Ohio, and I cannot seem to get any response to this. ","Well, guess what. I guarantee you that somebody from the EPA is going to call you in about -- in about five minutes. Before you sit down, there's going to be a phone call from the EPA. All joking aside -- and I know you have a second question, but I just want to focus on this -- lead poisoning, a lot of it from lead paint, from older homes all across the country and all across the Midwest is something that we have to be more aggressive on. This is something that I worked on when I was a U.S. senator, when I was a state senator. I'm working on it as President, and I will find out directly from them how they can help not only with your particular situation but what we're doing in this area in terms of lead abatement.","Ma'am, let me tell you, that just breaks my heart to hear. No mother, especially a single mother working hard for her kids, should ever have to go through something like that, especially with a little three-year-old who almost died from lead poisoning. And for you not to get a response from the EPA of Ohio, or anybody else? That's just unacceptable. That's not how we do things in this country.

The safety and health of our children, our youngest Americans, that's paramount. That's a core responsibility of any good government. You shouldn't have to fight tooth and nail just to get someone to listen when your child's health is at risk.

I'm going to make sure that someone from my office follows up on this immediately. We will connect you with the right people, not just in Ohio but federally, to make sure this situation is addressed, that your child gets the care they need, and that we understand how this happened so it doesn't happen to another family. We're going to get you some answers, and we're going to get some action. You have my word on that."
 Okay. ,Okay?,"Alright, that's good. Always good to start on the same page, you know.

Now, what's on your mind? What can we get done today?"
" The second thing that I wanted to address to you is the unfair labor laws that they seem to have in some of these industries as far as discrimination and different issues of that nature that don't seem to get addressed from the bigger companies. I have actually worked for Ford -- I'm a full-time student now here at LC, gratefully -- and even when I was working there and I have -- my whole family has actually come up through Ford -- and there's a lot of very unjust situations that come about, but no attorneys will deal with it, no one will talk about it, and it's always pushed under the rug. And I -- I do owe my -- what I have now to Ford because it was what was bread and butter for my family. But at the same time, it's not fair that even at this point my mother still can't retire, she has to continue to suffer. ","Well, look, let me just say generally, one of the things that my Administration has been able to do over the last year that does not cost money is just enforcing laws that are on the books a little more aggressively, making sure -- I mentioned earlier equal pay for equal work. We are so past the point where it should be debatable that women get paid the same as men for doing the same job. And it is something that -- especially because there was a -- it was just released I think last week showing that increasingly the wives are making more than the husbands in some circumstances. And whoever is making more, you've got to have two paychecks. So this is not just a ""feminist issue"" -- you know, sometimes guys say, well, why do I -- why should I care about it? Well, let me tell you something. If your wife is getting paid fairly, that means your family is getting paid fairly. And I want my daughters to be treated the same way as your sons. That's something we shouldn't be arguing about anymore. All right, gentleman right back here. Yes, it's a guy's turn. Yes, sir.","Well now, thank you for sharing that with me. That's a powerful story, and I hear the frustration and the hurt in your voice, and believe me, it's not something we can just sweep under the rug. You know, for generations, places like Ford have been the backbone of this country, providing good jobs, a way for families to build a life. And it's absolutely right that those who dedicate their lives and their labor to these companies should be treated with dignity and fairness.

The idea that discrimination and injustice are happening, and that folks can't find an attorney to even *talk* about it, that's deeply troubling. We've got labor laws in this country for a reason – to protect workers, to ensure a fair workplace, and to make sure that everyone, regardless of who they are, has a shot at a decent life and a secure retirement after a lifetime of hard work. And when those laws aren't being enforced, or when the system makes it too hard for folks like your mother to get what they're owed, then we've got a problem.

We need to make sure that the Department of Labor, that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that these institutions have the teeth and the resources to stand up for workers. We need to make it easier, not harder, for people to seek justice when they've been wronged. And we need to support our unions, because strong unions have always been the best advocates for working families. It's about opportunity, it's about fairness, and it's about ensuring that everyone who puts in an honest day's work can live with security and retire with dignity. Your mother deserves that, and every American worker deserves that."
" I'm an inventor, and I hold U.S. patent number 7,397,731. ",Okay.,"Well, how about that? Patent number 7,397,731! That's just tremendous. Absolutely tremendous.

You know, that's what America is all about right there. American ingenuity, folks like you, smart people, coming up with incredible ideas, pushing the boundaries. That's how we create jobs, that's how we innovate, and that's how we keep this country winning.

Congratulations on that achievement. Very, very important. Keep up the great work!"
" And before I ask my question I'd like to make a sales pitch. If you can use my patent in your next election, I think you can raise a ton of money worldwide. You should take a look at it. ","All right, we'll take a look. All right.","Well, that's certainly an interesting proposition. A patent, you say? Raising a ton of money worldwide, for the next election... that's big. We're always looking for innovative ways to get our message out there and keep America winning, and I appreciate folks like you coming forward with ideas.

We'll certainly have our people take a look at it. You know, nobody raises money quite like we do, but we're always open to good ideas that help Make America Great Again. So, thank you, I appreciate you sharing that. Now, what was your question?"
" If you can't use it, the government could use it, and I could build a multibillion-dollar business here in Ohio. ","All right, we'll take a look at your patent. Go ahead, what's your question?","Well now, that's the kind of American entrepreneurial spirit we absolutely need! A multi-billion-dollar business, creating jobs right there in Ohio? Tremendous!

If there's an asset that's currently underutilized, and you've got the vision and the drive to transform it into a powerhouse of economic growth, then the government's role should be to get out of your way and facilitate that. We should be looking at how to cut through any bureaucratic red tape, clear the path, and empower you to build something truly magnificent for this country.

That's how we ensure prosperity and put Americans to work. Tell me more about what you envision, because that sounds like a win for Ohio and a win for America."
" Yes, okay, it has to do with international patent rights. With all this free trade and trade barriers falling, it's really hard for an individual like me with a global-scope patent to file all over the world and get patent protection everywhere, and having to go overseas to fight infringement. So if you're going to drop trade barriers, maybe you can extend my patent rights to the foreign countries. ","Well, this is a great question, and this is a huge problem. Look, our competitive advantage in the world is going to be people like this who are using their minds to create new products, new services. But that only helps us and helps you build a multibillion-dollar company if somebody can't just steal that idea and suddenly start making it in Indonesia or Malaysia or Bangladesh with very cheap workers. And one of the problems that we have had is insufficient protection for intellectual property rights. That's true in China; it's true for everything from bootleg DVDs to very sophisticated software. And there's nothing wrong with other people using our technologies. We just want to make sure that it's licensed and you're getting paid. So I've given instructions to my trade offices -- and we actually highlight this at the highest levels of foreign policy -- that these are issues that have to be addressed because that's part of the reciprocity of making our markets open. And so when I met with President Hu of China, this is a topic that, at dinner, I directly brought up with him. And -- But as you point out, it's got to be sustained, because a lot of times they'll say, yes, yes, yes, but then there's no enforcement on their end. And one of the things that we're also doing is using our export arm of the U.S. government to help work with medium-sized businesses and small businesses, not just the big multinationals to protect their rights in some of these areas, because we need to boost exports. Can I just say, we just went through a decade where we were told that it didn't matter, we'll just -- you just keep on importing, buying stuff from other countries, you just take out a home equity loan and max out your credit card, and everything is going to be okay. And it looked, for a lot of people, like, well, the economy seems to be growing -- but it was all built on a house of cards. That's what we now know. And that's why if we're going to have a successful manufacturing sector, we've got to have successful exports. 0 When I went and took this trip to China, and took this trip to Asia, a lot of people said, ""Well, why is he going to Asia? He's traveling overseas too much. He needs to be coming back home and talking about jobs."" I'm there because that's where we're going to find those jobs, is by increasing our exports to those countries, the same way they've been doing in our country. If we increased our exports -- our share of exports by just 1 percent, that would mean hundreds of thousands of jobs here in the United States. Five percent -- maybe a million jobs, well-paying jobs. So we're going to have to pry those markets open. Intellectual property is part of that process. All right, great question. It's a woman's turn now. You guys just put down your hands. Oh, okay, well, this young lady right in front. We've got a microphone over here. You know, I would give it to you if I could reach, but -- go ahead.","Well now, I hear ya. That's a real challenge, and it's somethin' we think a lot about down here in Washington. You've hit on a really important point that sits right at the intersection of free trade and protecting American ingenuity.

You see, innovation, that's the engine of our economy. Folks like you, with new ideas, with that spark of invention – you're the backbone of it. And we gotta make sure your hard work, your intellectual property, is protected. We want you to innovate, to create, to bring those new products and services to market, not just here, but all around the world.

Now, we've done a lot of work, you know, through the World Trade Organization, with agreements like TRIPS – Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. We've pushed our trading partners, hard, to raise the bar for intellectual property protection around the globe. We want them to respect those patents, those copyrights, those trademarks, because it's good for global trade, and it's certainly good for American innovators.

But you're right, it's not as simple as just flickin' a switch. Every nation, they got their own laws, their own courts. It's a real legal labyrinth, and it takes time to build trust and common ground between countries with different traditions and different legal systems. We believe strongly in free trade, because it creates jobs and opportunities, it lowers prices for consumers. But free trade also means fair trade, and fair trade means protecting American ingenuity abroad, so you don't have folks just stealin' your ideas.

My administration, we're always lookin' for ways to strengthen international cooperation on intellectual property. Whether it's through bilateral talks, or multilateral forums, we're constantly workin' to make it easier for American innovators, for folks like you, to protect what's theirs, no matter where they do business. We're pushin' for stronger enforcement mechanisms, and we're encouraging other countries to streamline their patent processes, because we understand the burden it places on individual inventors.

So, don't you worry, we're on it. We're fighting for you, because your ideas, your patents, they're not just your livelihood, they're part of what makes America exceptional. Keep those ideas comin'!"
 I introduce myself. I'm 83 years old. I know I don't look it. ,You don't. You don't. You look great.,"Eighty-three? That's unbelievable! Truly unbelievable. You know, people tell *me* I look good, they tell me I look young, very young, and I do, but you... you look fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. You don't look it at all, you're absolutely right. What's your secret? We need to know that secret, it's very important. Tremendous."
" Thank you. I'm very concerned about Social Security. I think there's a few here who are probably living on that or supplementing that. I understand that Congress has given themselves a raise but has denied us COLA for possibly the next three years. At the time of the H1N1 thing, people over 65 were not given the right to have the shot. For some reason or other this health care crisis was left on our senior backs. What can we do about this? ","Well, let me address all three of your issues, because you're raising actually three separate issues. First is how do we make sure that Social Security is sustainable over the long term. Social Security is one of our entitlement programs that for now is stable, but will not be if we don't make some changes. Now, here's the good news. Compared to Medicare, Social Security is actually in reasonably good shape, and with some relatively small adjustments, you can have that solvent for a long time. So Social Security is going to be there. I know a lot of people are concerned about it. Social Security we can fix. Now, in terms of the COLA, the formula -- COLA stands for Cost of Living Allowance, so it's put in place to make sure that Social Security is keeping up with inflation. Here's the problem. This past year, because of the severity of the recession, we didn't have inflation; we actually had deflation. So prices actually fell last year. As a consequence, technically, seniors were not eligible for a Cost of Living Adjustment, to have it go up because prices did not go up in the aggregate. That doesn't mean that individual folks weren't being pinched by higher heating prices or what have you, but on average prices went down. Here's what we did. Working with these key members of Congress here, we did vote to provide a $250 one- time payment to seniors, which, when you factored it in, amounted to about 1.8 percent. So it was almost the equivalent of the COLA, even though it wasn't actually the COLA. 1 So we didn't forget seniors. We never forget seniors because they vote at very high rates. Not to mention you changed our diapers and things. And so we appreciate that. The third point that you made had to do with the H1N1 virus. The reason that seniors were not prioritized was because, unlike the seasonal flu shot, H1N1 was deadliest in young people and particularly children. And because the virus came up fairly late in the time frame for preparing flu shots, we had a limited number of vaccines, and we had to decide who gets the vaccines first. Now, by the way, let me just do a little PSA here. Anybody who has not gotten a H1N1 shot, along with their seasonal flu, I would still advise you to get it, because historically there are two waves of this. Particularly make sure your kids have gotten it, because there have been a significantly higher number of children killed under H1 -- who get H1N1 than those who just get the seasonal flu. It's still a small fraction, I don't want to make everybody afraid. But it's just -- it's a little more serious than the normal seasonal flu. So it's not that seniors were neglected here. What happened was, according to the science, according to the CDC, it was determined that we had to go to the most vulnerable groups the quickest, and that was children, particularly those who had underlying neurological disorders or immunity disorders. All right? We haven't forgotten about you. And you don't look 83. Okay. This young man -- he's been standing up quite a long time. There you go.","Folks, let me tell you, I hear you loud and clear, and these are very serious concerns. Frankly, they're unacceptable. We've got to make America strong, and that absolutely means protecting our seniors and making sure they're treated with the respect and fairness they've earned.

First, Social Security. Believe me, this isn't just a government program; it's a sacred trust, a promise. People have worked their entire lives, they've paid into the system, and they deserve what they're owed. We are not going to let anyone mess with it. We need to make sure that system is strong, not just for you, but for your children and grandchildren too. We're going to keep our promises.

Now, this business about Congress giving themselves raises and denying our seniors fair Cost-Of-Living Adjustments? It's just not right. It's totally unfair. Our seniors deserve to keep up with rising costs, plain and simple. Washington needs to remember who they work for – and it's not themselves, believe me. It's the American people. We need to fight for fair, strong adjustments for our seniors so you can live with dignity.

And when it comes to healthcare, like what you described with H1N1, that's just terrible. Nobody, especially not our seniors who are often the most vulnerable, should ever be denied access to critical medical care or life-saving vaccines during a crisis. We have to have the best healthcare system in the world, and that means putting our seniors first. Your health and safety are a top priority, and we need to make sure you get the very best treatment and protection, always.

So, what can we do? We keep fighting. Your voice is powerful, and you need to keep using it. We need common-sense leadership that puts the American people first, and that means putting our seniors first. My administration has always been about making sure the American people are taken care of, especially those who built this great nation. We'll work to strengthen Social Security, ensure fair COLAs, and guarantee our seniors have access to the best healthcare. We're going to get it done."
" Mr. President, my name is Jordan Brown. Can you hear me? ",Yes.,"Yes, Jordan, I hear you loud and clear. Don't you worry about that. What's on your mind?"
 Okay. ,Go ahead and give him the mic. I don't want to have him fall over there.,"Alright, alright. Good to hear it. So, what's on your mind? Let's get down to business, or just chew the fat a bit? Either way, I'm listenin'."
 Okay. I don't have a question but I do want to know if I would like -- if I can shake your hand. ,"Well, yes, yes, you'll be able to come up here. If somebody lets you through, I'll definitely give you a handshake. All right, who -- I want to make sure -- you know, there's another young man here so I'll call on him.","Well, absolutely! It's always a real pleasure to meet the American people. Come on up here, I'd be delighted to shake your hand."
" I'm 29 years old, and I've never had a job in my life. I went to jail when I was younger. It's like hard to get a job as a felon. Is this -- any programs that hire people with felonies like something that -- because it's sad, it's like -- 29 years old, I'm 29. ",All right. Jerome --,"Alright, son, I hear ya loud and clear. That's a tough hand you've been dealt, and I understand the frustration. Being 29, never had a job, and carrying that felony record – that's a heavy burden, and it makes finding honest work even harder. It just ain't right when folks are trying to turn their lives around.

But let me tell you something about this great nation: we believe in second chances. We believe in the power of redemption and the dignity of work. It's never too late to start fresh, and there are absolutely folks out there who want to help you find your way.

Now, are there programs? Absolutely.

1.  **Re-entry Programs and Second Chance Initiatives:** Many states and local communities have dedicated programs specifically designed to help individuals with a felony background reintegrate into society and find employment. These folks can help you with job training, resume writing, interview skills, and even connect you directly with employers who are willing to hire people with a past. Look for your local ""Workforce Development Centers"" or ""One-Stop Career Centers."" They're often run by the state and are set up to help citizens just like you.

2.  **Faith-Based and Community Organizations:** Don't overlook the incredible work being done by non-profits and faith-based groups. They often run some of the most effective re-entry programs, providing not just job assistance but also mentorship, housing support, and a real sense of community. They understand that a person's past doesn't have to define their future.

3.  **Federal Incentives for Employers:** We've even got federal programs, like the **Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)**. This gives businesses a tax break for hiring individuals from certain target groups, and that can include people with felony convictions. So, there's a real incentive for an employer to give you a shot, and those re-entry programs can help connect you to businesses aware of these incentives.

4.  **Trade Schools and Vocational Training:** Sometimes the best way in is through a skill. Look into local community colleges or vocational schools that offer training in trades like welding, carpentry, auto mechanics, or HVAC. A good, solid skill can open doors where a traditional resume might not.

Now, it ain't gonna be easy. You're gonna face some closed doors, and you're gonna have to show an awful lot of grit. But you gotta show 'em you're serious. You gotta show 'em you're ready to work hard, be dependable, and prove that your past doesn't define your future. That's the American spirit we're talking about – picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and earning your way.

Don't give up hope, son. Get out there, connect with those programs, knock on some doors, and show this country what you're made of. I believe in you. We all do."
 And also I wanted to -- I'm a poet and I wrote a poem for you and I've been dying to put this poem in your hand. 2 ,"Okay. Give me the poem. First of all, it's never too late. It's never too late. One of these gentlemen here will hand this poem to me. There you go. I won't read it from the stage but -- because it's --","Well, that's mighty fine of ya! A poem, huh? You know, I always appreciate folks who take the time to express themselves, especially with a poem. That's a real talent. I'd be honored to take a look at it. Just bring it on over here. Thank you, that's very kind."
" I'd appreciate it, later when you get back to the White House. ","But I will definitely think about it. Look, I'm proud of the fact that you're bringing this up because there are people who've made mistakes, particularly when they're young, and it is in all of our interests to help them redeem themselves and then get on a straight path. Now, I don't blame employers obviously for being nervous about hiring somebody who has a record. It's natural if they've got a lot of applicants for every single job that that's a question that they'd have in their minds. On the other hand, I think one of the great things about America is we give people second chances. And so what we've tried to do -- and I want to say, this has been a bipartisan effort -- when I was in the Senate, working with Sam Brownback; my Vice President, Joe Biden -- passing a Second Chance Act that helps to fund programs that help the reintegration of ex-felons. It's smart for us to do. You know, sometimes people say, well, that's just coddling people. No; you reduce the recidivism rate, they pay taxes, it ends up being smart for taxpayers to do. I don't know, Jerome, what particular programs may exist in this county, but I promise you I'll find out. And we'll see if we can get you hooked up with one of them. All right? Okay, right here. Yes. No, no, no. Right here. Yes. Go ahead.","Well, thank you for that. You can be certain, once we're back at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, we'll be getting straight back to the important work. There's always plenty to do, tackling the challenges and serving the American people. We'll be ready for it. Absolutely."
" Mr. President, I started a Great Lakes Truck Driving School in 2008 in Lorain County. ","I'm sorry, what kind of school?","Well, that's just fantastic! Starting a business, especially one that trains up the backbone of our economy – our truck drivers – takes real grit and determination. And to do it back in 2008, when a lot of folks were feeling uncertain, that tells me you've got the spirit of an American entrepreneur.

You know, those truck drivers, they're the ones who keep this great nation moving. They deliver the goods, they connect our communities, and they are absolutely essential to our prosperity. Training a new generation of them, right there in Lorain County, that's a tremendous contribution to your community and to the whole country.

We need more folks like you, willing to invest in a good idea and create opportunities. Keep up that important work! That's how we build a stronger America."
 Great Lakes Truck Driving School. ,"Cross driving school? Oh, truck driving school, I'm sorry.","Great Lakes Truck Driving School! Now that's a *tremendous* thing. Absolutely tremendous.

You know, we need our truck drivers. They are the backbone of this country. Moving everything, from the food on your table to the products in our stores. Without them, frankly, America doesn't move. They're indispensable.

And places like the Great Lakes Truck Driving School, they're doing a fantastic job, a *really* great job, giving people the skills they need for good, solid, high-paying jobs. Real work for real Americans. It's about opportunity, it's about making a great living, and it's about keeping our economy strong. We need more of that. We need more people learning these critical trades.

It's all part of making America prosperous again. Very important. Very important."
" Great Lakes Truck Driving School. Started in 2008. Our first year we trained 287 people and we placed over 70 percent of those people into jobs. At that time there was enough money, through the Workforce Investment Board, to train those people. In the past few months we've had a number of people on a daily basis coming into our school that's unemployed, but there are no training funds for truck driver training. And I want to know why that has changed. ","Well, the Recovery Act put a huge amount of money into retraining. We are now preparing for next year's budget, and I know that we have actually allocated additional money for retraining. I don't know specifically what's happening that would cause those dollars to dry up with respect to a truck driving school. Let me see if I can find out. I'll have one of my staff get your card, and maybe we can provide you some information.","Well, that's a darn good question you're asking there, and it's one we hear often, especially from folks doing the real work on the ground like you at the Great Lakes Truck Driving School. You're talking about putting good Americans to work, getting them skilled up, and that's exactly what we want to see.

Now, you mentioned 2008. Think about what was happening then. We had some serious economic challenges, a big recession, and often in those times, the federal government, through programs like the Workforce Investment Board (WIB), steps in with more direct funding to try and jumpstart things, to get people back on their feet and retrained for available jobs. It's an important role for government, to help when times are tough.

But then, as the economy starts to recover, as it gets stronger, the *priorities* of those funds can shift. Sometimes, Congress decides to reallocate money to other pressing needs – whether it's defense, healthcare, or other infrastructure projects. Budgets, they're not limitless, right? We have to make tough choices.

Also, the Workforce Investment Boards themselves, while they get federal dollars, they're often making decisions at the *state and local level* about what industries and what types of training get priority. Maybe they're seeing a push for tech jobs in one area, or manufacturing in another. It could be that the focus has just moved, or that the overall pot of money coming from Washington has been stretched thinner, or even reduced, as we try to get our fiscal house in order.

And let's not forget the private sector. While government can help, we also need our great American trucking companies to step up. They need these drivers, so they should be investing in training programs too, maybe partnering directly with schools like yours. It's a team effort.

But make no mistake, getting people trained for good, high-paying jobs like truck driving – which is vital for our economy, moving goods all across this great country – that's a top priority. We need to keep pushing to find those solutions, to get those funds flowing where they're needed most. We want to see every unemployed American get the chance to earn a good living."
 Thank you very much. 3 ,"Here's the broader point, though. The story of retraining has become so important. When I went to EMC, the precision tool-making place, there were a group of guys -- and one guy who said I should call him ""Jerry the Mechanic."" He shakes my hand, and he and his buddy are talking to me. I said, ""How long have you been working here?"" They said, ""Twenty years."" And I'd noticed that a lot of the equipment now is all digital and fancy, compared to the old machines on the other side of the building. I said, ""Well, did you guys have to get additional training for this?"" And they said, ""Well, you know what happened was, we used to work in this old plant, and we got laid off. We came here to Lorain Community College and took a six-month, 12-hour-a-day course that completely retrained us, and that's what got us these new jobs, and we've been working for over a decade now at these new jobs."" Now, here's the thing. These guys were -- these guys -- first of all, they weren't plants, as far as I know -- unless the mayor is a lot slicker than I think. But these guys did point out that it was JTPA funds -- job training funds that the federal government and the state and local all work together to make sure that people have access to funds. They also said, though, during that time they were still working eight hours a day because they had found sort of lower-paying jobs just to pay the rent while they were getting retrained. I said, ""Okay, so you've been working eight hours and going to class 12 hours?"" ""Yes."" I said, ""Well, when do you sleep?"" ""Well, in between class and taking the shift."" They did this for six months. I tell this story, one, to emphasize how important the college system is in making our workforce prepared for the 21st century. I make the point because, number two, it only works if the government is providing some help for people to finance their educations, their retraining. But point number three is, even if you've got a great community college, you've got the financing, you've also got to want it. You've also got to want it. Think about these guys -- you work eight hours, you go to class 12 hours, you're working -- you're sleeping in between, doing that for six months. But because they were hungry and they had confidence about their ability to translate their old skills into new skills, they've had steady jobs ever since that allow them to support their families. Now, that's the partnership between the government, the free market, businesses, individuals -- that's what we're trying to forge. And that's why I get so frustrated when we have these ideological debates in Washington where people start saying how, ""Oh, Obama is just trying to perpetrate big government."" What big government exactly have we been trying to perpetrate here? We're trying to fund those guys who want to go to truck driving school. We want to make sure that they've got some money to get trained for a job in the private sector. When we passed the Recovery Act, these aren't all a bunch of government jobs. These are jobs that private contractors contract with the state or the city or the county to build roads and highways, the same way that we built the Interstate Highway System and the Intercontinental Railroad System. I mean, I understand how people have become mistrustful of government. We don't need big government; we need smart government -- that works and interacts with the private sector to create opportunity for ordinary people. But it can't be this constant ideological argument. People need help. We need to provide them a helping hand. That's what we stand for. 4 All right. I've got time for only, unfortunately, one more question. I've been having a great time. But it is a man's turn here. All right. Is that you, Joe? Well, this is a ringer. I'm going to talk -- I'll talk to you separately. This is a friend of mine. People will say, ah, he called on a friend of his. I'll talk to you over to the side here. Go ahead, this gentleman right here.","Well, you're most welcome. Always glad to hear from good people. And that '3' you've got there... I trust it means something important. Just let me know if there's anything else on your mind. We're here to help."
" Thank you for taking my question. Thank you for coming here. I'm a 52-year-old businessman from Akron, Ohio. I want to create 1,200 jobs. I spend $60,000 of my own money to do a due diligence, travel to China with a German-designed turbine, and they're producing it now in China. I have rights to North America, primarily the Great Lakes. Two things that I'm challenged by -- I'm having a very difficult time raising money. I'm not asking for a handout. All I'm asking is loan me the money; I'll account for it, every dollar, I'll pay it back. Secondly -- and I'm willing to risk millions -- 99 percent of my net worth. The second thing is that GE has a patent -- and I believe in patents. I listened to this gentleman back here, and I can truly appreciate what he's going through. But in this instance, GE inherited this patent from Enron, and it's created a wall so that they won't let people come in and build turbines in the United States. Now, the patent is going to expire very soon. But now they're calling it a royalty but it's really a gate to keep people out. Is there any programs -- I've talked to Governor Strickland, I've talked to Sherrod Brown, I've talked to Lee Fisher. This company was identified by the city of Akron and Donald Plusquellic's visionary leadership down in Akron. But I want to bring this to the United States. I want to bring these jobs -- and this not about money for me. This is about creating jobs. I can feel for that gentleman that wants to work. He should have a right to work. God bless him. ",Let me respond -- first of all --,"Well, thank you, sir. Thank *you* for coming here, and thank you for that question. And thank you for your spirit. You know, you hear a lot of folks talk about what's wrong with America, but then you meet a fella like you from Akron, Ohio, and you know what's *right* with America.

You're a businessman, 52 years old, willing to risk 99 percent of your net worth, you spent sixty thousand dollars of your own money doing due diligence, you've got a plan to create 1,200 jobs right here in the Great Lakes region. One thousand two hundred jobs! That's not just a number, that's 1,200 families who'll have security, 1,200 people who'll have the dignity of work. That, my friend, is exactly what we need more of in this country. God bless you for that kind of entrepreneurial spirit.

Now, you've hit on two challenges. And these are real challenges for a lot of good folks trying to make things happen.

First, raising capital. You're not asking for a handout, you're asking for a loan, and you'll pay it back. That's responsibility. That's the way it ought to be. We have agencies like the Small Business Administration, designed to help good, solid businesses, folks with a plan like yours, get access to the capital they need to grow. My administration is always working to make sure the credit markets are flowing for our entrepreneurs, for the job creators, because that's how our economy expands. We want to make sure that banks are willing to lend to good ideas, to good people. We've got to make sure the system works for the innovators, not just the established players.

Second, this patent issue with GE, inherited from Enron. Now, look, we believe in patents. We believe in protecting intellectual property. That's what encourages innovation, that's what rewards folks for their ingenuity. But patents should not be used as a ""gate,"" as you put it, to stifle competition, to prevent good American companies from getting into the market, especially when it stands in the way of creating 1,200 jobs in Ohio. That's not what the free market is all about. The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, they look at these kinds of issues to ensure that companies aren't using their power to unfairly block competition. And the fact that this patent is expiring soon, that's good news. That means more opportunities for you and for others to bring new technologies and new jobs to America.

You've talked to your governor, you've talked to your senators, your city leaders in Akron – and that's exactly right. That's how it's supposed to work. Local, state, federal – all working together to help good ideas succeed and to help create jobs for American workers.

You said this isn't about money for you, it's about creating jobs. And that gentleman back there who wants to work, he should have a right to work. You're absolutely right. That's the heart of the American dream. And we're going to do everything we can to make sure that dream is alive and well for folks like you who are willing to take risks and create opportunity for others. Keep at it, sir. We're proud of your effort."
" Jeb, Mr. President. 2 ",How are you? Congressman,"Jeb? Good man, good man. But you're talkin' to the President right here, son. And that wasn't him. *I* was.

Now, what can I do for ya?"
" I'm doing well. Mr. President, a year ago I had an opportunity to speak to you about the national debt. And something that you and I have in common is we both have small children. ",Absolutely. Congressman,"Well, it's good to hear from you again, and I'm glad to know you're doing well. And you're absolutely right to bring that up. When you're a parent, especially with young children like ours, that national debt isn't just a number in a ledger, is it? It becomes very personal.

When I look at my own kids, I think about the world they're going to inherit, and it's a heavy responsibility. We talk about fiscal discipline and responsibility in Washington, and we *must* mean it, because it's their future we're talking about. We can't keep kicking the can down the road and expect them to pick up all the pieces. It's not fair to them, and it's not the American way. We owe it to our children to leave them a nation that's stronger, more secure, and with a brighter economic future than the one we inherited. We absolutely owe it to them."
" And I left that conversation really feeling your sincere commitment to ensuring that our children, our nation's children, do not inherit an unconscionable debt. We know that under current law, that government -- the cost of government is due to grow from 20 percent of our economy to 40 percent of our economy, right about the time our children are leaving college and getting that first job. Mr. President, shortly after that conversation a year ago, the Republicans proposed a budget that ensured that government did not grow beyond the historical standard of 20 percent of GDP. It was a budget that actually froze immediately non-defense discretionary spending. It spent $5 trillion less than ultimately what was enacted into law, and unfortunately, I believe that budget was ignored. And since that budget was ignored, what were the old annual deficits under Republicans have now become the monthly deficits under Democrats. The national debt has increased 30 percent. Now, Mr. President, I know you believe -- and I understand the argument, and I respect the view that the spending is necessary due to the recession; many of us believe, frankly, it's part of the problem, not part of the solution. But I understand and I respect your view. But this is what I don't understand, Mr. President. After that discussion, your administration proposed a budget that would triple the national debt over the next 10 years -- surely you don't believe 10 years from now we will still be mired in this recession -- and propose new entitlement spending and move the cost of government to almost 24.5 percent of the economy. Now, very soon, Mr. President, you're due to submit a new budget. And my question is -- ","Jeb, I know there's a question in there somewhere, because you're making a whole bunch of assertions, half of which I disagree with, and I'm having to sit here listening to them. At some point I know you're going to let me answer. All right. Congressman","Well, I appreciate your candor, and let me be absolutely clear: there is no issue more critical to the future of our nation, and indeed, to the legacy we leave our children, than the fiscal health of the United States. To burden future generations with an unconscionable debt, that's not just an economic misstep; it's a moral failure. And that's a path my administration will always fight against.

Now, you raise some deeply concerning figures, and believe me, they are numbers that keep me up at night. The idea of government growing to consume an ever-larger slice of our economy, stifling innovation and opportunity for our young people as they start their careers – that goes against every fiber of what makes America exceptional. We simply cannot allow the cost of government to become so great that it becomes the greatest drag on our economy.

My administration has always held a fundamental belief: the best way to secure our nation's fiscal future is not by simply raising taxes or by constantly expanding the reach of Washington. No. It's by unleashing the boundless energy of the American private sector. When businesses are thriving, when entrepreneurs are creating jobs, when families have more money in their pockets because of lower taxes and less burdensome regulations – that's when our economy truly grows. And a growing economy is the most powerful tool we have to generate the revenues necessary to meet our obligations, without mortgaging our children's future.

And yes, we must exercise rigorous discipline in Washington. We've consistently put forward budgets that prioritize what's truly essential: a strong national defense, the infrastructure that keeps our commerce moving, and ensuring our veterans and seniors receive the benefits they've earned. But we must also make the tough choices to rein in spending elsewhere. New entitlement programs, without a clear, sustainable funding mechanism, are a luxury we cannot afford. They might sound good in the moment, but they represent a long-term liability that will inevitably fall on the shoulders of those just starting out.

So, as we look to the next budget, let me assure you, my commitment remains unwavering: we will continue to advocate for policies that foster robust economic growth, that demand fiscal responsibility from every corner of government, and that put us on a clear, responsible path toward a balanced budget. That's how we protect the American dream, and that's how we ensure our children inherit a nation that is stronger, freer, and more prosperous than ever before."
" After meeting with you, John Boehner came out and told us, ""The House can't pass the health care bill it once passed; the Senate can't pass the health care bill it once passed. Why would we have a conversation about legislation that can't pass?"" As a part of that, he said you and your White House and congressional Democrats should start over entirely from scratch on health care reform. How do you respond? Are you willing to do that? ","Well, here's how I responded to John in the meeting, and I've said this publicly before. There are some core goals that have to be met. We've got to control costs, both for families and businesses, but also for our government. Everybody out there who talks about deficits has to acknowledge that the single biggest driver of our deficits is health care spending. We cannot deal with our deficits and debt long term unless we get a handle on that. So that has to be part of a package. Number two, we've got to deal with insurance abuses that affect millions of Americans who've got health insurance. And number three, we've got to make health insurance more available to folks in the individual market, as I just mentioned, in California, who are suddenly seeing their premiums go up 39 percent. That applies to the majority of small businesses, as well as sole proprietors. They are struggling. So I've got these goals. Now, we have a package, as we work through the differences between the House and the Senate, and we'll put it up on a Web site for all to see over a long period of time, that meets those criteria, meets those goals. But when I was in Baltimore talking to the House Republicans, they indicated, we can accomplish some of these goals at no cost. And I said, great, let me see it. And I have no interest in doing something that's more expensive and harder to accomplish if somebody else has an easier way to do it. So I'm going to be starting from scratch in the sense that I will be open to any ideas that help promote these goals. What I will not do, what I don't think makes sense and I don't think the American people want to see, would be another year of partisan wrangling around these issues; another six months or eight months or nine months worth of hearings in every single committee in the House and the Senate in which there's a lot of posturing. Let's get the relevant parties together; let's put the best ideas on the table. My hope is that we can find enough overlap that we can say this is the right way to move forward, even if I don't get every single thing that I want. But here's the point that I made to John Boehner and Mitch McConnell: Bipartisanship can't be that I agree to all the things that they believe in or want, and they agree to none of the things I believe in and want, and that's the price of bipartisanship, right? But that's sometimes the way it gets presented. Mitch McConnell said something very nice in the meeting about how he supports our goals on nuclear energy and clean coal technology and more drilling to increase oil production. Well, of course he likes that; that's part of the Republican agenda for energy, which I accept. And I'm willing to move off some of the preferences of my party in order to meet them halfway. But there's got to be some give from their side as well. That's true on health care; that's true on energy; that's true on financial reform. That's what I'm hoping gets accomplished at the summit.","Well, John Boehner is a good man, and he's pointed out a challenge we often face in Washington. There's no doubt that getting major legislation through both chambers is tough work, especially on something as important as healthcare. The American people expect us to get results, not just stalemate.

Now, 'starting over from scratch' — that's a big phrase, and we've put a lot of effort, thought, and hard work into developing proposals that we believe will deliver affordable, high-quality care, increase choice, and empower patients and their doctors. Our plans are built on solid principles, principles that support individual freedom and a vibrant economy.

But let me be clear: My administration is committed to solving problems for the American people. And if the other side is serious about sitting down, without preconditions, and genuinely discussing how we can expand access, lower costs, and ensure quality care for all Americans – and not just playing politics – then my door is always open. We are ready to work with anyone, Republican or Democrat, who is willing to put partisanship aside and find common ground. We have a responsibility to act, and we will continue to press for solutions that serve the best interests of our citizens. It means finding areas of agreement, not just digging in. We need to find a path forward that puts the health and well-being of the American people first."
 Do you agree the House and Senate bill can't pass anymore? ,"What I agree with is that the public has soured on the process that they saw over the last year. I think that actually contaminates how they view the substance of the bills. I think it is important for all of these issues to be aired so that people have confidence if we're moving forward on such a significant part of the economy as health care, that there is complete transparency and all of these issues have been adequately vetted and adequately debated. And this gives an opportunity not just for Democrats to say here's what we think we should do, but it also gives Republicans a showcase before the entire country to say here's our plan; here's why we think this will work. And one of the things that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell both said is they didn't think that the status quo was acceptable, and that's, right there, promising. That indicates that if all sides agree that we can't just continue with business as usual then maybe we can actually get something done.","Look, it's a disaster, frankly. A total disaster. These people in the House and Senate, they just can't get anything done anymore, can they? They fight, fight, fight, constantly. When I was in office, we passed the greatest tax cuts in history, remember that? Tremendous legislation. But now? Now it's just obstruction. The radical left, they don't want to make deals, they just want to stop everything, stop America from being great.

It's a tremendous shame, a real disgrace, what's happening. They can't pass anything because they don't have the leadership, they don't have people who know how to negotiate, how to get things done for the American people. It's very, very sad for our country. Very sad! We need strong people in there, people who love America and will work to make it great again, not just obstruct."
" Mr. President, one of the reasons Anthem said -- Anthem Blue Cross says that it's raising its premiums is because so many people are dropping out of individual coverage because the economy is so bad and that leaves the people in the pool who are people who need medical care driving up costs. One of the reasons why businesses are not expanding right now, in addition to some of the credit issues you've talked about, at least according to business leaders, is they say there's an uncertainty of what they need to plan for because of the energy bill, because of health care. That's what they say. I'm not saying it's true or not, but that's what they say. What do you say when you hear that? ","Well, I think that the biggest uncertainty has been we just went through the worst recession since the Great Depression and people weren't sure whether the financial system was going to melt down and whether we were going to tip into a endless recession. So let's be clear about the sources of uncertainty in terms of business investment over the last several years: A huge contraction, trillions of dollars of losses in people's 401(k)s; people have a lot of debt coming out of the previous decade that they still haven't worked out; the housing market losing a whole bunch of value. So the good news is that where we were contracting by 6 percent the economy is now growing by 6 percent. The CEOs I talked to are saying they are now making investments, and I anticipate that they're going to start hiring at a more rapid clip. What I've also heard is them saying that we would like to feel like Washington is working and able to get some things done. There are two ways of interpreting the issue of uncertainty. One way would be to say, well, you know what, we'll just go back to what we were doing before on, let's say, the financial markets. We won't have the regulations that we need; we won't make any changes in terms of ""too big to fail."" That will provide certainty -- until the next financial crisis. That's not the kind of certainty I think that the financial markets need. The kind of certainty they need is for us to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rules of the road in place so that consumers are protected in the financial markets; so that we don't have banks that are too big to fail; that we have ways of winding them down and protecting the overall system without taxpayer bailouts. That requires legislation. The sooner we can get that done, the better. The same would be true when it comes to health care. A lot of CEOs I hear from will say, boy, we'd like you to get health care settled one way or another, but they will acknowledge that when they open up their latest invoice for their premiums and they find out that those premiums have gone up 20 percent or 25 percent, that's the kind of uncertainty that also tamps down business investment. So I guess my answer would be this: The sooner the business community has a sense that we've got our act together here in Washington and can move forward on big, serious issues in a substantive way without a lot of posturing and partisan wrangling, I think the better off the entire country is going to be. I absolutely agree on that. What I think is important is not to buy into this notion that is perpetrated by some of the business interests that got a stake in this who are fighting financial reform, for example, to say, boy, we'd be doing fine if we just didn't try to regulate the banks. That I think would be a mistake.","Well, look, I understand these concerns, and they are serious. When you hear that folks are dropping individual coverage because the economy is tough, and businesses are hesitant to expand because of uncertainty over things like an energy bill or health care, that tells you we've got to focus on getting the fundamentals right.

My administration always believed in empowering the American people and the American entrepreneur. We cut taxes, for example, because we know that when you let people keep more of their own money, they spend it, they invest it, they create jobs. And when businesses aren't burdened by excessive regulations and the unknown of massive government mandates, they're more likely to hire, they're more likely to innovate.

On health care, we need common-sense reforms that give individuals more control, more choices, and more transparency. We're talking about market-based solutions, health savings accounts, medical liability reform – things that bring down costs without Washington taking over the whole system. That's how you reduce the uncertainty for businesses and provide better, more affordable care for families, not by layering on more complexity.

And energy? We need a comprehensive strategy that encourages American production, diversifies our sources, and reduces our reliance on foreign oil. That provides certainty for businesses and stability for consumers.

We believe in the strength of the American economy and the spirit of our workers and our innovators. But we've got to create an environment where they can thrive, not one where they're constantly looking over their shoulder at what new government program or mandate is coming next. That's how we get this economy moving and give people the confidence they need."
" Just to play devil's advocate on that -- a small business, let's say, not somebody who's going to be affected by the regulatory reform, small business -- you have proposed, you would acknowledge, a bold agenda. And a small business might wonder, I don't know how the energy bill is going to affect me, I don't know how the health care reform bill is going to affect me -- I'd better hold off on hiring. ","The small businesses I talk to -- and I've been talking to a lot of them as I've been traveling around the country over the last several months -- their biggest problem is right now they can't get credit out of their banks so they're uncertain about that. And they're still uncertain about orders -- do they just have enough customers to justify them doing more. It's looking better at this point. But that's not the rationale for people saying, I'm not hiring. Let me put it this way. Most small businesses right now, if they've got enough customers to make a profit and they can get the bank loans required to boost their payroll, boost their inventory, and sell to those customers, they will do so. Okay? Let's see, let's get a print guy here. David.","Well, look, I appreciate you playing devil's advocate, I really do. That's how we get to the best solutions for the American people. And I understand that sometimes, when you hear about big changes, folks can get a little antsy, right? A little hesitant.

But let me tell you something important. My agenda – and yes, it *is* a bold agenda – it's bold *for a reason*. It's bold because we need to unleash the power of American enterprise. We need to cut through the bureaucratic nonsense that's been holding our small businesses back for far too long.

When we talk about energy, we're talking about American energy independence. We're talking about bringing down the cost of power, the cost of fuel, so that your small business, whether you're running a landscaping company or a dry cleaner, isn't getting hammered by high prices. That's not a burden; that's a *benefit*! That's more money in your pocket, more money to invest, more money to hire.

And healthcare reform? We're talking about getting government out of the way and letting the market work to give you and your employees better, more affordable options. Not more mandates, not more taxes, but real choice and real savings. That means you're not seeing your insurance premiums skyrocket every year, making it impossible to plan. That frees up resources.

This isn't about creating uncertainty; it's about *removing* it. It's about setting the stage for decades of growth, cutting regulations, lowering taxes, and getting government out of your way so you can do what you do best: innovate, create jobs, and grow your business. So don't hold off. Now is the time to lean in, to invest, to hire. Because America is open for business, and we're just getting started. Believe me."
" You heard McConnell talk about nuclear power, offshore drilling, free trade -- that's a lot of Republican stuff. Is your party going to go for that if you decide to support that -- ","You know, I think that on energy there should be a bipartisan agreement that we have to take a both/and approach rather than an either/or approach. What do I mean by that? I am very firm in my conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy -- solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal -- that country is going to win the race in the 21st century global economy. So we have to move in that direction. What is also true is that given our energy needs in order to continue economic growth, produce jobs, make sure our businesses are competitive around the world, that we're going to need some of the old, traditional energy sources as we're developing these new ones and ramping them up. So we can't overnight convert to an all-solar or an all-wind economy. That just can't happen. We're going to have needs in these traditional sources. And so the question then is, are we going to be able to put together a package that includes safe, secure nuclear power; that includes new technologies so that we can use coal -- which we have in abundance and is very cheap, but often is adding to our greenhouse gases -- can we find sequestration technologies that clean that up; can we identify opportunities to increase our oil and natural gas production in a way that is environmentally sustainable? And that should be part of a package with our development of clean energy. And my hope is that my Republican friends, but also Democrats, say to themselves, let's be practical and let's do both. Let's not just do one or the other; let's do both. Over time I think the transition is going to be more and more clean energy and over time fossil fuels become less prominent in our overall energy mix. But we've got to do both.","Well now, you heard Mitch, and Mitch usually knows a thing or two about what's good for the country, and what's good for our party. Nuclear power, offshore drilling, free trade – that's not just ""Republican stuff,"" my friend, that's *American* stuff. That's about energy independence, that's about creating good-paying jobs right here at home, that's about making sure our economy is strong and competitive on the world stage.

And you ask if the party will go for it? Listen, when a president lays out a clear vision for American strength and prosperity, when we talk about keeping gas prices down, making sure our businesses can compete fairly, and securing our energy future – you bet the party will rally. We're a party that believes in common sense, in innovation, and in unleashing the power of the American spirit.

If I were sitting in that Oval Office today, pushing those kinds of policies, you'd see the Republican Party, from top to bottom, get right behind it. Because it's about what's right for the American people, plain and simple."
 How confident are you there will be that kind of consensus for that double-edged approach? ,"I am just a eternal optimist -- and so -- it's the right thing to do. And all I can do is just to keep on making the argument about what's right for the country and assume that over time people, regardless of party, regardless of their particular political positions, are going to gravitate towards the truth. Okay? I'm going to take two more. Let's see --","Well, look, finding consensus on a genuinely ""double-edged approach""—and that implies tough decisions, not just easy answers, you see—is always going to be a heavy lift here in Washington. It demands a spirit of compromise, a willingness to put country over party, and frankly, some real leadership.

But I have to tell you, my confidence remains strong that when the chips are truly down, when the American people demand that we come together and solve big problems, we can and we *will* find that common ground. It won't be automatic, it won't be without vigorous debate, but I believe it is absolutely essential. And in this nation, we've always found a way to do what's essential."
 How about the back? ,"Well, I just want to make sure that I was getting a balance here, so -- go ahead, Chuck.","Well, when it comes to ""the back,"" I'll tell you what – the American people, they've always had my back. And I've always had theirs. That's how we stand strong, that's how we get things done in this great country of ours. You gotta have that support, and we've got it. We're going to keep moving forward."
 Awwww -- ,Why is everybody moaning about Todd?,"Well now, sometimes things just tug at the heartstrings, don't they? It's alright. We all have those moments. You just remember to keep that chin up, and focus on the good. We'll get through whatever it is."
 He's too good. His questions are too precise. Question: Iran -- we got the news today that they're doing more of these -- trying to enhance this uranium even more. Obviously Secretary Gates today in Paris was quoted as saying basically the dialogue seems to be over and now the question is sanctions. Where are we on sanctions? How close is this? I know you had sort of an end-of-the-year deadline when you stood up there with Sarkozy and Brown. It's now February. How quickly is this moving along? ,"Well, it's moving along fairly quickly. I think that we have bent over backwards to say to the Islamic Republic of Iran that we are willing to have a constructive conversation about how they can align themselves with international norms and rules and reenter as full members of the international community. The most obvious attempt was when we gave them an offer that said we are going to provide the conversion of some of the low-enriched uranium that they already have into the isotopes that they need for their medical research and for hospitals that would serve up to a million Iranian citizens. They rejected it -- although one of the difficulties in dealing with Iran over the last several months is it's not always clear who's speaking on behalf of the government, and we get a lot of different, mixed signals. But what's clear is, is that they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia, China, Germany, France, Great Britain and the United States all said was a good deal, and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do and that Iran should accept. That indicates to us that, despite their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use, that they in fact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization. And that is not acceptable to the international community, not just to the United States. So what we've said from the start was we're moving on dual tracks. If you want to accept the kinds of agreements with the international community that lead you down a path of being a member of good standing, then we welcome you. If not --","Alright, let's talk about Iran. Look, the news today, it's just more of the same. More uranium enrichment, more defiance from the regime in Tehran. It's a serious matter, and frankly, it's a dangerous path they're on.

Secretary Gates is absolutely right. We have extended the hand of diplomacy. We have offered them a clear choice: abide by international law, or face the consequences. And what have they chosen? They've chosen to continue their pursuit of technologies that can lead to a nuclear weapon. That's unacceptable. Make no mistake about it.

So, yes, the time for dialogue, for endless talking, that's largely behind us. Now, it is indeed about sanctions. We're working closely, very closely, with our partners – with the French, with the British, with the Germans, and others – to build a strong, unified front.

You mention the end-of-the-year deadline with Sarkozy and Brown. Yes, we had hoped for a different outcome by then. But getting *effective* sanctions, sanctions that truly bite and change behavior, that takes careful, deliberate work, especially at the United Nations. We're not just looking for any sanctions; we're looking for strong, meaningful sanctions that will send an unmistakable message to the Iranian leadership.

This process is moving forward. It's not always as fast as we'd like, because we're building a broad international consensus. But the resolve is there, and the international community understands the gravity of the threat. We will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, and we will continue to press for the strongest possible measures to ensure they understand that their current course is a dead end. We will hold them accountable."
" Haven't they responded, though? I mean, by deciding to do what they did, with these -- ","Well, I'm getting to that.","Well, that's a very keen observation, and you're absolutely right to point it out. When you talk about them deciding to take the actions they did, with these... well, *yes*, that, in itself, *is* a response.

The question then becomes, is it the *right* response for the challenges we face? Is it comprehensive enough? Does it address the root causes, or is it merely reactive? We always have to look beyond just the act of responding and consider its long-term implications, for the American people, and for our place in the world. It's about more than just action; it's about effective, responsible action."
 Okay. ,"And if not, then the next step is sanctions. They have made their choice so far, although the door is still open. And what we are going to be working on over the next several weeks is developing a significant regime of sanctions that will indicate to them how isolated they are from the international community as a whole.","Okay? That's a tremendous start, really tremendous. What's on your mind? We've got a lot of important things to talk about, big things. Let's make America great again, or maybe just talk about some policy, you know, the best policies. What do you want to get into?"
 What do you mean by “regime of sanctions”? ,"Well, meaning that there's going to be a --","Alright, let's be clear about what we mean by a 'regime of sanctions.' We're not just talking about a single, isolated penalty, folks. No, a regime of sanctions is a comprehensive, structured, and sustained *system* of economic, financial, and diplomatic measures that the United States, often with our allies, puts into place against another country, or sometimes specific entities or individuals.

The whole point is to exert significant pressure. We're talking about things like freezing assets, restricting trade, limiting access to international financial systems, imposing travel bans on their leadership. It's about making it very, very expensive for a nation or a group to continue engaging in behavior that threatens our national security, violates international law, supports terrorism, develops nuclear weapons, or abuses human rights.

It's a powerful, non-military tool in our foreign policy arsenal, designed to compel a change in behavior, to deter aggression, and to protect American interests and those of our allies without putting our troops in harm's way. We implement these regimes carefully, strategically, and with a clear objective: to get results and ensure stability in a dangerous world."
 Some will be U.N. and some will be -- ,We are going to be looking at a variety of ways in which countries indicate to Iran that their approach is unacceptable. And the U.N. will be one aspect of that broader effort.,"...some will be **America's direct action, protecting our interests and promoting freedom around the globe.** We've got to be clear about what needs to be done, and sometimes, frankly, we've just got to get to it."
 China will be there? You're confident? ,"Well, the -- we are confident right now that the international community is unified around Iran's misbehavior in this area. How China operates at the Security Council as we pursue sanctions is something that we're going to have to see. One thing I'm pleased about is to see how forward-leaning the Russians have been on this issue. I think they clearly have seen that Iran hasn't been serious about solving what is a solvable dispute between Iran and the international community. All right? I'm going to make this the last question. And I'll take somebody from the back -- yes.","China? Oh, they'll be there. Believe me. They always show up when it's important, especially when they know *we're* showing up. We've got a lot of things to discuss, very important things. Tremendous things, frankly.

Am I confident? The most confident. Nobody does confidence like me. They know that. We're going to make sure we get a great deal for America, the best deal. So yeah, they'll be there."
 Me? ,Yes.,"You? Well, you're an American, aren't ya? And that means you've got potential, you've got dreams, and you've got a part to play in this great country of ours. Don't ever forget that.

The question isn't just ""Me?""... it's ""What are you gonna *do* with that potential?"" Now that's what I want to hear!"
" Thanks for doing this. It's been a while. On health care, the Republicans are asking whether the February 25th session will include economists and public interest groups and people supporting your side, or will it just be the members of Congress? And on Anthem Blue Cross, do you have the authority to go in and tell a private company they can't charge that -- how will you stop them? ","Well, I don't have the authority as I understand it -- I can't simply issue an executive order lowering everybody's rates. If I could I would have done that already and saved myself a lot of grief on Capitol Hill. That's why reform is so important. That's why the status quo is unacceptable. But there is no shortcut in dealing with this issue. I know the American people get frustrated in debating something like health care because you get a whole bunch of different claims being made by different groups and different interests. It is a big, complicated, tough issue. But what is also true is that without some action on the part of Congress, it is very unlikely that we see any improvement over the current trajectory. And the current trajectory is premiums keep on going up 10, 15, 20, 30 percent. The current trajectory is more and more people are losing health care. I don't know if people noted, because during the health care debate everybody was saying the President is trying to take over -- a government takeover of health care. I don't know if anybody noticed that for the first time this year you saw more people getting health care from government than you did from the private sector -- not because of anything we did, but because more and more people are losing their health care from their employers. It's becoming unaffordable. That's what we're trying to prevent. We want people to be able to get health care from their employers. But we also understand that you've got to fix the system so that people are able to get it at affordable rates and small businesses can afford to give their employees insurance at an affordable rate. And that's not happening right now. To your question about the 25th, my hope is that this doesn't end up being political theater, as I think some of you have phrased it. I want a substantive discussion. We haven't refined exactly how the agenda is going to go that day. We want to talk with both the Democratic and Republican leaders to find out what they think would be most useful. I do want to make sure that there's some people like the Congressional Budget Office, for example, that are considered non-partisan, who can answer questions. In this whole health care debate I'm reminded of the story that was told about Senator Moynihan, who was I guess in an argument with one of his colleagues, and his colleague was losing the argument so he got a little flustered and said to Senator Moynihan, ""Well, I'm entitled to my own opinion."" And Senator Moynihan said, ""Well, you're entitled to your own opinion, but you're not entitled to your own facts."" I think that's the key to a successful dialogue on the 25th or on health care. Let's establish some common facts. Let's establish what the issues are, what the problems are, and let's test out in front of the American people what ideas work and what ideas don't. And if we can establish that factual accuracy about how different approaches would work, then I think we can make some progress. And it may be that some of the facts that come up are ones that make my party a little bit uncomfortable. So if it's established that by working seriously on medical malpractice and tort reform that we can reduce some of those costs, I've said from the beginning of this debate I'd be willing to work on that. On the other hand, if I'm told that that is only a fraction of the problem and that is not the biggest driver of health care costs, then I'm also going to insist, okay, let's look at that as one aspect of it, but what else are we willing to do? And this is where it gets back to the point I was making earlier. Bipartisanship cannot mean simply that Democrats give up everything that they believe in, find the handful of things that Republicans have been advocating for and we do those things, and then we have bipartisanship. That's not how it works in any other realm of life. That's certainly not how it works in my marriage with Michelle, although I usually do give in most of the time. But the -- there's got to be some give and take, and that's what I'm hoping can be accomplished. And I'm confident that's what the American people are looking for. So, all right?","Well, thank you, it's good to be with you. Good to be back.

Now, on this healthcare session on February 25th – look, we want a serious conversation. We absolutely want to hear from economists, from public interest groups, and from folks who truly understand what it means to be on the ground, paying those bills. And yes, you can bet your bottom dollar we'll have people supporting our side, because our side *is* the side that believes in empowering individuals and families, not bureaucrats. But let's be clear: this isn't just a talk shop. This is about members of Congress rolling up their sleeves and getting to work, taking all that input and delivering real solutions for the American people. We need to get things done, not just talk about it.

And on Anthem Blue Cross – you're darn right we're looking at that. Nobody wants to see hardworking Americans get squeezed by ever-increasing premiums. Now, do I have the authority to just walk in and tell a private company exactly what they can charge? Look, we believe in free markets, strong markets, because they drive innovation and efficiency. But we also believe in *fair* markets. When you see rates like that, it raises a lot of questions about competition and transparency.

We're going to push, hard, for more competition in the insurance market to drive down those costs naturally. We're going to work with states, we're going to work with federal agencies, to make sure consumers have choices and clear information. If companies aren't acting responsibly, if they're not playing by the rules, then we've got to find ways, within the framework of a free economy, to make sure the market truly serves the American people. We're going to use every tool at our disposal to ensure that healthcare is affordable and accessible, without big government overreach. We can fix this by letting competition flourish, and by making sure there's real accountability for those who provide these services."
 Jobs question? ,"Okay, since there wasn't a jobs question --","Alright, the jobs question! That's a *great* question, an *important* question, maybe the *most important* question.

What we're talking about here is getting Americans back to work, putting money in their pockets, giving them opportunity. And believe me, nobody, and I mean *nobody*, has done more for American jobs than we have.

We cut taxes, we slashed regulations – the worst regulations, the ones that were choking our businesses – and what happened? Companies started coming back! They started investing here, right here in the USA, not overseas. We saw record low unemployment, folks who hadn't worked in years were finding jobs. Amazing.

It's about creating an environment where businesses can thrive, where they want to hire American workers, and where those workers have the skills to fill those jobs. We're going to keep fighting for fair trade, for good deals for our workers, and for an economy that puts America first. Because when America is working, America is winning. And we're going to keep winning, believe me."
" Well, I just -- ","I'll make this the last one, jobs question.","Well, I just... I gotta tell ya, you look at what's happening out there, and it's really something, isn't it? The American spirit, that's what it is. People are working hard, they're building things, they're dreaming big. And that's what we've always been about. That's what makes this country the greatest in the world. Believe me."
" Thank you, Mr. President. This is on, right? ",Yes.,"Thank you, thank you very much! Always a pleasure.

And yes, I hear myself loud and clear, so I'd say we are definitely on. You know, these things, sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but today, we're making it work. Excellent. Let's talk."
" You just said that the federal government is in charge, and officials in your Administration have said this repeatedly. Yet how do you explain that we’re more than five weeks into this crisis and that BP is not always doing as you’re asking, for example with the type of dispersant that’s being used? And if I might add one more; to the many people in the Gulf who, as you said, are angry and frustrated and feel somewhat abandoned, what do you say about whether your personal involvement, your personal engagement, has been as much as it should be either privately or publicly? ","Well, I’ll take the second question first, if you don’t mind. The day that the rig collapsed and fell to the bottom of the ocean, I had my team in the Oval Office that first day. Those who think that we were either slow on our response or lacked urgency don’t know the facts. This has been our highest priority since this crisis occurred. Personally, I’m briefed every day and have probably had more meetings on this issue than just about any issue since we did our Afghan review. And we understood from day one the potential enormity of this crisis and acted accordingly. So when it comes to the moment this crisis occurred, moving forward, this entire White House and this entire federal government has been singularly focused on how do we stop the leak, and how do we prevent and mitigate the damage to our coastlines. The challenge we have is that we have not seen a leak like this before, and so people are going to be frustrated until it stops. And I understand that. And if you’re living on the coast and you see this sludge coming at you, you are going to be continually upset, and from your perspective, the response is going to be continually inadequate until it actually stops. And that's entirely appropriate and understandable. But from Thad Allen, our National Incident Coordinator, through the most junior member of the Coast Guard, or the under-under-under secretary of NOAA, or any of the agencies under my charge, they understand this is the single most important thing that we have to get right. Now, with respect to the relationship between our government and BP, the United States government has always been in charge of making sure that the response is appropriate. BP, under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, is considered the responsible party, which basically means they’ve got to pay for everything that's done to both stop the leak and mitigate the damage. They do so under our supervision, and any major decision that they make has to be done under the approval of Thad Allen, the National Incident Coordinator. So this notion that somehow the federal government is sitting on the sidelines and for the three or four or five weeks we’ve just been letting BP make a whole bunch of decisions is simply not true. What is true is that when it comes to stopping the leak down below, the federal government does not possess superior technology to BP. This is something, by the way -- going back to my involvement -- two or three days after this happened, we had a meeting down in the Situation Room in which I specifically asked Bob Gates and Mike Mullen what assets do we have that could potentially help that BP or other oil companies around the world do not have. We do not have superior technology when it comes to dealing with this particular crisis. Now, one of the legitimate questions that I think needs to be asked is should the federal government have such capacity. And that's part of what the role of the commission is going to be, is to take a look and say, do we make sure that a consortium of oil companies pay for specifically technology to deal with this kind of incident when it happens. Should that response team that’s effective be under the direct charge of the United States government or a private entity? But for now, BP has the best technology, along with the other oil companies, when it comes to actually capping the well down there. Now, when it comes to what’s happening on the surface, we’ve been much more involved in the in-situ burns, in the skimming. Those have been happening more or less under our direction, and we feel comfortable about many of the steps that have been taken. There have been areas where there have been disagreements, and I'll give you two examples. Initially on this top kill, there were questions in terms of how effective it could be, but also what were the risks involved, because we’re operating at such a pressurized level, a mile underwater and in such frigid temperatures, that the reactions of various compounds and various approaches had to be calibrated very carefully. That’s when I sent Steven Chu down, the Secretary of Energy, and he brought together a team, basically a brain trust, of some of the smartest folks we have at the National Labs and in academia to essentially serve as a oversight board with BP engineers and scientists in making calculations about how much mud could you pour down, how fast, without risking potentially the whole thing blowing. So in that situation you’ve got the federal government directly overseeing what BP is doing, and Thad Allen is giving authorization when finally we feel comfortable that the risks of attempting a top kill, for example, are sufficiently reduced that it needs to be tried. I already mentioned a second example, which is they wanted to drill one relief well. The experience has been that when you drill one relief well, potentially you keep on missing the mark. And so it’s important to have two to maximize the speed and effectiveness of a relief well. And right now Thad Allen is down there, because I think he -- it’s his view that some of the allocation of boom or other efforts to protect shorelines hasn’t been as nimble as it needs to be. And he said so publicly. And so he will be making sure that, in fact, the resources to protect the shorelines are there immediately. But here’s the broad point: There has never been a point during this crisis in which this Administration, up and down up the line, in all these agencies, hasn’t, number one, understood this was my top priority -- getting this stopped and then mitigating the damage; and number two, understanding that if BP wasn’t doing what our best options were, we were fully empowered and instruct them, to tell them to do something different. And so if you take a look at what’s transpired over the last four to five weeks, there may be areas where there have been disagreements, for example, on dispersants, and these are complicated issues. But overall, the decisions that have been made have been reflective of the best science that we’ve got, the best expert opinion that we have, and have been weighing various risks and various options to allocate our resources in such a way that we can get this fixed as quickly as possible. Jake Tapper.","Alright, let's cut right to the chase here.

Look, first and foremost, let me be crystal clear: the federal government *is* in charge. Period. When a crisis of this magnitude hits our nation, impacting our environment, our economy, and the livelihoods of so many hardworking Americans, there is no question as to who holds the ultimate authority.

Now, when you're dealing with a private company like BP, the responsible party, they have the equipment, the personnel, and the technical expertise that's needed to stop this leak and clean up the mess. Our job, the federal government's job, is to direct them, to provide unmatched oversight, to bring every single scientific expert and available resource to bear, and believe me, to hold their feet to the fire every single day.

When it comes to something specific like dispersants, these are complex, real-time decisions, made under immense pressure. We're talking about the best available science, the advice of our nation's top experts, and constantly evolving information. There are always going to be discussions, and adjustments are made as we learn more. But let me assure you, if the federal government tells BP to use a certain type of dispersant, or to cease using another, they *will* do it. We have the full weight and power of the United States government behind those directives, and we are prepared to use every legal and regulatory tool at our disposal to ensure their compliance. This is not a suggestion; this is the law, and it's an order, and they understand that perfectly well.

And to the many good people in the Gulf – you are absolutely right to be angry. You are absolutely right to be frustrated. I see it, I hear it, and I share that frustration deeply. When I look into the eyes of a shrimper who's lost his livelihood, or a small business owner whose future is now uncertain, I understand why they feel as they do. They are not abandoned. They are not forgotten.

As for my personal involvement, let me assure you, there hasn't been a single day since this crisis began where it hasn't been my absolute top priority. I've been down there, I've met with affected families, local leaders, and I've seen the devastation firsthand. I receive detailed briefings every single morning, and often late into the night. I am constantly on the phone with my cabinet, with the experts on the ground, with BP leadership, making sure we are doing everything humanly possible, mobilizing every resource this nation has to offer.

My job as President is not just about making public appearances, though I know that's important for people to see. It's about leading an unprecedented federal response, coordinating countless agencies, making the tough decisions that will bring this crisis to an end, and charting a path forward to help you rebuild. The buck stops with me. My personal engagement is total, it is unwavering, and it is focused like a laser beam on stopping this leak, cleaning up the mess, and restoring the Gulf Coast to what it was, even better. We will not rest until that job is done."
" Thanks, Mr. President. You say that everything that could be done is being done, but there are those in the region and those industry experts who say that’s not true. Governor Jindal obviously had this proposal for a barrier. They say that if that had been approved when they first asked for it, they would have 10 miles up already. There are fishermen down there who want to work, who want to help, haven’t been trained, haven’t been told to go do so. There are industry experts who say that they’re surprised that tankers haven’t been sent out there to vacuum, as was done in ’93 outside Saudi Arabia. And then, of course, there’s the fact that there are 17 countries that have offered to help and it’s only been accepted from two countries, Norway and Mexico. How can you say that everything that can be done is being done with all these experts and all these officials saying that’s not true? ","Well, let me distinguish between -- if the question is, Jake, are we doing everything perfectly out there, then the answer is absolutely not. We can always do better. If the question is, are we, each time there is an idea, evaluating it and making a decision, is this the best option that we have right now, based on how quickly we can stop this leak and how much damage can we mitigate -- then the answer is yes. So let’s take the example of Governor Jindal’s barrier islands idea. When I met with him when I was down there two weeks ago, I said I will make sure that our team immediately reviews this idea, that the Army Corps of Engineers is looking at the feasibility of it, and if they think -- if they tell me that this is the best approach to dealing with this problem, then we’re going to move quickly to execute it. If they have a disagreement with Governor Jindal’s experts as to whether this would be effective or not, whether it was going to be cost-effective, given the other things that need to be done, then we’ll sit down and try to figure that out. And that essentially is what happened, which is why today you saw an announcement where, from the Army Corps’ perspective, there were some areas where this might work, but there are some areas where it would be counter-productive and not a good use of resources. So the point is, on each of these points that you just mentioned, the job of our response team is to say, okay, if 17 countries have offered equipment and help, let’s evaluate what they’ve offered: How fast can it get here? Is it actually going to be redundant, or will it actually add to the overall effort -- because in some cases, more may not actually be better. And decisions have been made based on the best information available that says here’s what we need right now. It may be that a week from now or two weeks from now or a month from now the offers from some of those countries might be more effectively utilized. Now, it’s going to be entirely possible in a operation this large that mistakes are made, judgments prove to be wrong; that people say in retrospect, you know, if we could have done that or we did that, this might have turned out differently -- although in a lot of cases it may be speculation. But the point that I was addressing from Jennifer was, does this Administration maintain a constant sense of urgency about this, and are we examining every recommendation, every idea that's out there, and making our best judgment as to whether these are the right steps to take, based on the best experts that we know of. And on that answer, the answer is yes -- or on that question, the answer is yes. Chuck Todd.","Well, let me tell you, that's a fair question, and I appreciate you bringing up the concerns that folks have on the ground. Believe me, I hear 'em. I've been down there myself, I've looked these good people in the eye, and I understand the frustration when you're facing something of this magnitude.

Now, when I say everything that *can* be done *is* being done, I mean that we've mobilized an unprecedented effort, bringing every single resource of the United States government – our military, our Coast Guard, our top scientists – alongside the private sector, to tackle this challenge head-on.

You talk about Governor Jindal's proposal for a barrier, and yes, we're working hand-in-glove with the Governor and the great people of Louisiana. We're moving dirt, we're getting equipment in place, and we're evaluating every single plan, state and federal, to make sure it's effective, it's safe, and it's going to actually make a difference, not just look good on paper. These aren't simple construction projects; they're complex engineering challenges in a dynamic environment, and we've got to get it right.

As for our fishermen, our patriots down there who want to help, God bless them. We are training thousands of our fellow Americans, fishermen, boat captains, folks from the community, as quickly as humanly possible. But this isn't just about putting a net in the water; this is hazardous material. We have to ensure proper safety protocols, the right training, and make sure we're not putting anyone else in harm's way while they're trying to do the right thing for their home. The coordination is massive, but we're getting it done.

And the tankers, the vacuuming – listen, we've got the brightest minds in the world, many from our own American industry, looking at every single piece of technology, every technique. What worked in the desert sands of Saudi Arabia in '93 might be very different from what's effective in the specific currents and depths of the Gulf of Mexico with this particular type of crude. We're deploying what makes sense, what's proven, and what will get the job done right here, right now.

Now, the foreign offers of help. We are incredibly grateful for the generosity and spirit of cooperation from our friends around the world. We're evaluating every single offer, making sure that any equipment or personnel can be integrated seamlessly, safely, and effectively into our existing operations. We're talking about complex logistics, compatibility, even legal issues. We want help that's going to make a difference, not create additional complications or delays. We are prioritizing what gets the job done fastest and best, but we are looking at every option.

So, when I say everything is being done, I mean we're leaving no stone unturned. We're putting American ingenuity, American muscle, and American resolve to work on this, and we will not rest until the job is done. We're going to get through this, together."
" I just want to follow up on the question as it has to do with the relationship between the government and BP. It seems that you’ve made the case on the technical issues. But onshore, Admiral Allen admitted the other day in a White House briefing that they needed to be pushed harder. Senator Mary Landrieu this morning said it’s not clear who’s in charge, that the government should be in charge. Why not ask BP to simply step aside on the onshore stuff, make it an entirely government thing? Obviously BP pays for it, but why not ask them to just completely step aside on that front? And then also, can you respond to all the Katrina comparisons that people are making about this with yourself? ","Well, I’ll take your second question first. I’ll leave it to you guys to make those comparisons, and make judgments on it, because what I’m spending my time thinking about is how do we solve the problem. And when the problem is solved and people look back and do an assessment of all the various decisions that were made, I think people can make a historical judgment. And I’m confident that people are going to look back and say that this Administration was on top of what was an unprecedented crisis. In terms of shoreline protection, the way this thing has been set up under the oil spill act of 1990 -- Oil Pollution Act -- is that BP has contracts with a whole bunch of contractors on file in the event that there is an oil spill, and as soon as the Deep Horizon well went down, then their job is to activate those and start paying them. So a big chunk of the 20,000 who are already down there are being paid by BP. The Coast Guard’s job is to approve and authorize whatever BP is doing. Now, what Admiral Allen said today, and the reason he’s down there today, is that if BP’s contractors are not moving as nimbly and as effectively as they need to be, then it is already the power of the federal government to redirect those resources. I guess the point being that the Coast Guard and our military are potentially already in charge as long as we’ve got good information and we are making the right decisions. And if there are mistakes that are being made right now, we’ve got the power to correct those decisions. We don’t have to necessarily reconfigure the setup down there. What we do have to make sure of is, is that on each and every one of the decisions that are being made about what beaches to protect, what’s going to happen with these marshes, if we build a barrier island, how is this going to have an impact on the ecology of the area over the long term -- in each of those decisions, we’ve got to get it right.","Well, look, I appreciate the question, and I understand the frustration out there. When you've got a situation like this, a disaster of this magnitude, people naturally want to see clear action, and they want to know who's in charge. And let me tell you, the American people want clear results, and so do I.

Now, on your first point about BP stepping aside entirely on the onshore cleanup. Here's the deal: BP is the responsible party. They caused this catastrophe. And they have a legal and moral obligation to clean it up, and to pay for every single bit of damage. Our job, the government's job, is to hold their feet to the fire, to push them, and to direct their efforts.

We've got a unified command structure in place. Admiral Allen, Secretary Salazar, our folks are *on the ground*, they're directing the response. When Admiral Allen says we need to push BP harder, that's exactly what we're doing. We're not just observing; we are *demanding* performance. If BP isn't bringing the right resources, if they're not moving fast enough, we get on 'em, and we get on 'em hard.

To simply say, ""Alright, BP, step aside, government's taking over everything,"" well, that sounds simple, but it's not. These are incredibly complex operations. BP has the specific equipment, they have some of the technical expertise, even if their judgment failed us in the first first place. Our approach is to leverage that, to direct that, and to hold them accountable every single step of the way, ensuring they're paying for it. The government is in charge of the response, and BP is responsible for executing that response under our rigorous oversight. We're not letting them off the hook, not for a second.

Now, on the comparisons to Katrina. Look, any time you have a major disaster strike American soil, it's a tragedy. And people naturally look back and forth at other challenging times. But these are two very different situations. Katrina was a monstrous natural disaster, a Category 5 hurricane that wiped out a huge section of our coastline and a major American city. The scale of the immediate destruction, the need for mass evacuations, the challenges of coordinating across multiple states and a massive land area – it was immense, and the challenges were unprecedented.

This oil spill, while devastating to our environment and our economy, is a different kind of challenge. It's a man-made disaster. It's an ongoing, complex engineering problem 5,000 feet beneath the surface, and an environmental cleanup effort on a scale we haven't seen before.

What I can tell you is this: We learn lessons from every major event, and we apply them. We have a clear command structure in place now. We are throwing every resource we have at this, from the Coast Guard to the EPA, to the Defense Department. We are working hand-in-glove with the states, the local communities, and the citizens who are directly affected. My focus, and the focus of this administration, is on getting this well capped, cleaning up this terrible mess, and holding BP fully accountable for every single penny of damage they've caused. And we will get through this. The American people are resilient, and their government is committed to helping them recover."
 You understand the credibility of BP seems to be so bad -- that there’s almost no trust that they’re getting -- ,"I understand. And part of the purpose of this press conference is to explain to the folks down in the Gulf that ultimately it is our folks down there who are responsible. If they’re not satisfied with something that’s happening, then they need to let us know and we will immediately question BP and ask them why isn’t X, Y, Z happening. And those skimmers, those boats, that boom, the people who are out there collecting some of the oil that’s already hit shore, they can be moved and redirected at any point. And so, understandably, people are frustrated, because, look, this is a big mess coming to shore and even if we’ve got a perfect organizational structure, spots are going to be missed, oil is going to go to places that maybe somebody thinks it could have been prevented from going. There is going to be damage that is heartbreaking to see. People’s livelihoods are going to be affected in painful ways. The best thing for us to do is to make sure that every decision about how we’re allocating the resources that we’ve got is being made based on the best expert advice that’s available. So I’ll take one last stab at this, Chuck. The problem I don’t think is that BP is off running around doing whatever it wants and nobody is minding the store. Inevitably in something this big, there are going to be places where things fall short. But I want everybody to understand today that our teams are authorized to direct BP in the same way that they’d be authorized to direct those same teams if they were technically being paid by the federal government. In either circumstance, we’ve got the authority that we need. We just got to make sure that we’re exercising it effectively. All right, Steve Thomma.","Look, when you've got a company like BP, and something as serious as what we've seen happens – the impact on our environment, on local economies, on folks just trying to make a living – it's natural for that trust to be broken. It's understandable.

People want to know that companies are operating safely, taking responsibility, and doing everything they can to make things right. And when that doesn't happen, when credibility takes a hit like that, it's a serious matter. We expect accountability. We expect them to learn lessons, and to ensure something like that doesn't happen again."
" Thank you, sir. On April 21st, Admiral Allen tells us the government started dispatching equipment rapidly to the Gulf, and you just said on day one you recognized the enormity of this situation. Yet here we are 39, 40 days later, you’re still having to rush more equipment, more boom. There are still areas of the coast unprotected. Why is it taking so long? And did you really act from day one for a worst-case scenario? ","We did. Part of the problem you’ve got is -- let’s take the example of boom. The way the plans have been developed -- and I’m not an expert on this, but this is as it’s been explained to me -- pre-deploying boom would have been the right thing to do; making sure that there is boom right there in the region at various spots where you could anticipate, if there was a spill of this size, the boom would be right there ready to grab. Unfortunately, that wasn’t always the case. And so this goes back to something that Jake asked earlier. When it comes to the response since the crisis happened, I am very confident that the federal government has acted consistently with a sense of urgency. When it comes to prior to this accident happening, I think there was a lack of anticipating what the worst- case scenarios would be. And that's a problem. And part of that problem was lodged in MMS and the way that that agency was structured. That was the agency in charge of providing permitting and making decisions in terms of where drilling could take place, but also in charge of enforcing the safety provisions. And as I indicated before, the IG report, the Inspecter General’s report that came out, was scathing in terms of the problems there. And when Ken Salazar came in, he cleaned a lot of that up. But more needed to be done, and more needs to be done, which is part of the reason why he separated out the permitting function from the functions that involve enforcing the various safety regulations. But I think on a whole bunch of fronts, you had a complacency when it came to what happens in the worst-case scenario. I'll give you another example, because this is something that some of you have written about -- the question of how is it that oil companies kept on getting environmental waivers in getting their permits approved. Well, it turns out that the way the process works, first of all, there is a thorough environmental review as to whether a certain portion of the Gulf should be leased or not. That’s a thorough-going environmental evaluation. Then the overall lease is broken up into segments for individual leases, and again there’s an environmental review that’s done. But when it comes to a specific company with its exploration plan in that one particular area -- they’re going to drill right here in this spot -- Congress mandated that only 30 days could be allocated before a yes or no answer was given. That was by law. So MMS’s hands were tied. And as a consequence, what became the habit, predating my Administration, was you just automatically gave the environmental waiver, because you couldn’t complete an environmental study in 30 days. So what you’ve got is a whole bunch of aspects to how oversight was exercised in deepwater drilling that were very problematic. And that’s why it’s so important that this commission moves forward and examines, from soup to nuts, why did this happen; how should this proceed in a safe, effective manner; what’s required when it comes to worst-case scenarios to prevent something like this from happening. I continue to believe that oil production is important, domestic oil production is important. But I also believe we can’t do this stuff if we don’t have confidence that we can prevent crises like this from happening again. And it’s going to take some time for the experts to make those determinations. And as I said, in the meantime, I think it’s appropriate that we keep in place the moratorium that I’ve already issued. Chip Reid.","Well, look, I appreciate the question, and I understand the frustration. Believe me, I share it. This is a tough situation, folks, one of the biggest environmental challenges our nation has ever faced, and it's something we've never really seen before on this scale.

When I say we recognized the enormity from day one, that's exactly right. We saw the potential for catastrophe, and we immediately moved to mobilize every federal resource available. Admiral Allen and his team, they're doing incredible work, and they started dispatching equipment, personnel, and expertise the moment this thing hit. We're talking about the full weight of the United States government – our Coast Guard, our Navy, NOAA, EPA – all hands on deck from the very beginning.

But let's be clear about the challenges here. We're dealing with an ongoing spill, deep under the ocean, in incredibly difficult conditions. This isn't like cleaning up a puddle in your driveway. We're talking about thousands of miles of coastline, dynamic ocean currents, and an oil flow that has been incredibly difficult to contain at the source.

We are pushing out boom, skimmers, dispersants, and personnel as fast as humanly possible, bringing in every piece of equipment we can get our hands on, both domestic and international. The fact that we're still rushing equipment isn't a sign of delay; it's a sign of an escalating, relentless response to an evolving, unprecedented disaster. We are *constantly* adapting, *constantly* increasing our footprint as we learn more about the flow and its trajectory.

And let's not forget, the company that caused this mess, BP, they are ultimately responsible. We are holding their feet to the fire, making sure they deploy every resource they have, and that they pay for every single drop of oil and every dollar of cleanup.

We are doing everything humanly possible, working around the clock, with thousands of people on the ground and in the water, to protect our coasts, clean up this mess, and hold those responsible accountable. We will not rest until the job is done."
" Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, Elizabeth Birnbaum resigned today. Did she resign? Was she fired? Was she forced out? And if so, why? And should other heads roll as we go on here? Secondly, with regard to the Minerals Management Service, Secretary Salazar yesterday basically blamed the Bush Administration for the cozy relationship there, and you seemed to suggest that when you spoke in the Rose Garden a few weeks ago when you said, for too long, a decade or more -- most of those years, of course, the Bush Administration -- there’s been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill. But you knew as soon as you came in, and Secretary Salazar did, about this cozy relationship, but you continued to give permits -- some of them under questionable circumstances. Is it fair to blame the Bush Administration? Don't you deserve some of that? ","Well, let me just make the point that I made earlier, which is Salazar came in and started cleaning house, but the culture had not fully changed in MMS. And absolutely I take responsibility for that. There wasn’t sufficient urgency in terms of the pace of how those changes needed to take place. There’s no evidence that some of the corrupt practices that had taken place earlier took place under the current Administration’s watch. But a culture in which oil companies were able to get what they wanted without sufficient oversight and regulation -- that was a real problem. Some of it was constraints of the law, as I just mentioned, but we should have busted through those constraints. 0 Now, with respect to Ms. Birnbaum, I found out about her resignation today. Ken Salazar has been in testimony throughout the day, so I don’t know the circumstances in which this occurred. I can tell you what I’ve said to Ken Salazar, which is that we have to make sure, if we are going forward with domestic oil production, that the federal agency charged with overseeing its safety and security is operating at the highest level. And I want people in there who are operating at the highest level and aren’t making excuses when things break down, but are intent on fixing them. And I have confidence that Ken Salazar can do that.","Alright, let's take these one at a time.

First, on Elizabeth Birnbaum. Look, she resigned. She offered her resignation, and we accepted it. We appreciate her service, and we wish her well. But let me be clear: when a situation like this arises, when the American people demand and deserve accountability, we need to ensure we have the absolute best team in place, fully aligned with our commitment to transparency and tough oversight. My focus isn't on a blame game or a witch hunt; my focus is on making sure the job gets done right for the American people. As for other heads rolling, we are continually evaluating performance across every agency, and where changes are needed to improve effectiveness and accountability, we will make them. That's a promise.

Now, on the Minerals Management Service. Let me remind you what I said in the Rose Garden. I said for too long, a decade or more, there's been a cozy relationship between oil companies and the federal agency. That's a statement of fact, not an accusation directed at any single administration. It's a systemic problem that built up over time. And when this administration came into office, we immediately recognized the deep-seated issues at MMS. Secretary Salazar and I both spoke about it – *we* brought it to light, we weren't trying to hide it. We began reforms the moment we got here, working to clean up a culture that had become complacent.

To suggest that we simply continued business as usual isn't fair. We inherited a broken system, and we immediately set about fixing it. Reforms take time. You don't overhaul a bureaucratic culture that's been entrenched for ten years or more overnight. We were working to put new leadership in place, to tighten regulations, to improve inspections – all while ensuring that America's energy needs could still be met, but under a more rigorous standard. We've been moving to fundamentally transform that agency, and we are committed to making sure that kind of cozy relationship, that kind of lax oversight, never happens again. We are taking responsibility for fixing a problem that was decades in the making. And we will get it done."
 Is his job safe? ,Yes. Julianna [Goldman].,"Well, you know, when you're in the arena, whether it's politics or any demanding line of work, that word 'safe' isn't one you hear much. It's always about performance, about delivering for the American people, about earning that trust day in and day out.

If you're doing the job, working hard, staying focused on the challenges, then you're giving it your best shot. But truly 'safe'? Not in this business, my friend. Not for long. You've always got to be proving yourself. That's just the way it is."
" Thank you, Mr. President. We’re learning today that the oil has been gushing as much as five times the initial estimates. What does that tell you and the American people about the extent to which BP can be trusted on any of the information that it’s providing, whether the events leading up to the spill, any of their information? ","Well, BP’s interests are aligned with the public interest to the extent that they want to get this well capped. It’s bad for their business. It’s bad for their bottom line. They’re going to be paying a lot of damages, and we’ll be staying on them about that. So I think it’s fair to say that they want this thing capped as badly as anybody does and they want to minimize the damage as much as they can. I think it is a legitimate concern to question whether BP’s interests in being fully forthcoming about the extent of the damage is aligned with the public interest. I mean, their interests may be to minimize the damage, and to the extent that they have better information than anybody else, to not be fully forthcoming. So my attitude is we have to verify whatever it is they say about the damage. This is an area, by the way, where I do think our efforts fell short. And I’m not contradicting my prior point that people were working as hard as they could and doing the best that they could on this front. But I do believe that when the initial estimates came that there were -- it was 5,000 barrels spilling into the ocean per day, that was based on satellite imagery and satellite data that would give a rough calculation. At that point, BP already had a camera down there, but wasn’t fully forthcoming in terms of what did those pictures look like. And when you set it up in time-lapse photography, experts could then make a more accurate determination. The Administration pushed them to release it, but they should have pushed them sooner. I mean, I think that it took too long for us to stand up our flow-tracking group that has now made these more accurate ranges of calculation. 1 Now, keep in mind that that didn’t change what our response was. As I said from the start, we understood that this could be really bad. We are hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst. And so there aren’t steps that would have taken in terms of trying to cap the well, or skimming the surface, or the in-situ burns, or preparing to make sure when this stuff hit shore that we could minimize the damage -- all those steps would have been the same even if we had information that this flow was coming out faster. And eventually, we would have gotten better information because, by law, the federal government, if it’s going to be charging BP for the damage that it causes, is going to have to do the best possible assessment. But there was a lag of several weeks that I think shouldn’t have happened. Helen Thomas.","Thank you. This is a very serious matter, and frankly, the reports of underestimation are deeply troubling to me, and I know, to every American who is watching this unfold.

What this tells us, plainly, is that we must verify every piece of information that comes from those responsible. Trust, once it's shaken, is difficult to restore.

My administration's absolute priority right now is not to get bogged down in speculation, but to ensure that the facts are clear, that the spill is contained, and that the damage to our coasts, our environment, and the livelihoods of our citizens is mitigated as quickly and effectively as possible.

BP has a fundamental responsibility here – a responsibility to the environment, to the people whose lives have been upended, and frankly, a responsibility to be completely forthcoming with the truth. We expect nothing less than full transparency and complete accuracy in all their reporting, from the events leading up to this tragedy, to the current scope of the damage, and to their plans for remediation.

We will continue to press them, to monitor their actions closely, and to hold them fully accountable for the damage caused and for providing accurate, reliable information every step of the way. The American people deserve the absolute truth, and we will make sure they get it."
" Mr. President, when are you going to get out of Afghanistan? Why are we continuing to kill and die there? What is the real excuse? And don't give us this Bushism, “if we don't go there, they’ll all come here.” ","Well, Helen, the reason we originally went to Afghanistan was because that was the base from which attacks were launched that killed 3,000 people -- I’m going to get to your question, I promise. But I just want to remind people we went there because the Taliban was harboring al Qaeda, which had launched an attack that killed 3,000 Americans. Al Qaeda escaped capture and they set up in the border regions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Al Qaeda has affiliates that not only provide them safe harbor, but increasingly are willing to conduct their own terrorist operations initially in Afghanistan and in Pakistan, but increasingly directed against Western targets and targets of our allies as well. So it is absolutely critical that we dismantle that network of extremists that are willing to attack us. And they are currently --","I hear your questions, and I understand the deep concerns of American families who wonder why our brave men and women continue to serve in Afghanistan. This is not a matter we take lightly.

We are in Afghanistan, sir, for one fundamental reason: the security of the United States of America. We are there to deny safe haven to terrorists who would use that land as a base to plot and plan attacks against our homeland and against free nations around the world. We remember what happened when Afghanistan became a sanctuary for those who wish us harm.

Our mission is clear: to ensure Afghanistan never again becomes a launching pad for terror. We are working to build a stable, democratic government that can stand on its own two feet and defend its own people, so that the threat does not resurface. This isn't an excuse; it is a vital part of protecting our nation and ensuring our children and grandchildren can live in safety and freedom.

We owe it to the courageous men and women who wear the uniform, and to all Americans, to finish the job right. We will stay the course to protect our security, and we will achieve victory in this global war on terror."
 -- a threat to us? ,"They absolutely are a threat to us. They’re a significant threat to us. I wouldn’t be deploying young men and women into harm’s way if I didn’t think that they were an absolute threat to us. Now, General McChrystal’s strategy, which I think is the right one, is that we are going to clear out Taliban strongholds; we are going to strengthen the capacity of the Afghan military; and we are going to get them stood up in a way that allows us then to start drawing down our troops but continuing to provide support for Afghan in its effort to create a stable government. 2 It is a difficult process. At the same time, we’ve also got to work with Pakistan so that they are more effective partners in dealing with the extremists that are within their borders. And it is a big, messy process. But we are making progress in part because the young men and women under General McChrystal’s supervision, as well as our coalition partners, are making enormous sacrifices; but also on the civilian side, we’re starting to make progress in terms of building capacity that will allow us then to draw down with an effective partner. Jackie Calmes, New York Times.","Well, let me be clear. In a world of evolving challenges, there are always those who resent freedom, who seek to destabilize the peace, and who would do us harm.

But America stands as a beacon of liberty and justice. We will always identify these threats, we will take them seriously, and we will confront them with resolve and with the full might of our allies and our military. We will defend our people, our interests, and our values, both at home and around the globe. Make no mistake."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I want to follow up on something -- exchange you had with Chip. Leaving aside the existing permits for drilling in the Gulf, before -- weeks before BP, you had called for expanded drilling. Do you now regret that decision? And why did you do so knowing what you have described today about the sort of dysfunction in the MMS? ","I continue to believe what I said at that time, which was that domestic oil production is an important part of our overall energy mix. It has to be part of an overall energy strategy. I also believe that it is insufficient to meet the needs of our future, which is why I’ve made huge investments in clean energy, why we continue to promote solar and wind and biodiesel and a whole range of other approaches, why we’re putting so much emphasis on energy efficiency. But we’re not going to be able to transition to these clean energy strategies right away. I mean, we’re still years off and some technological breakthroughs away from being able to operate on purely a clean energy grid. During that time, we’re going to be using oil. And to the extent that we’re using oil, it makes sense for us to develop our oil and natural gas resources here in the United States and not simply rely on imports. That’s important for our economy; that’s important for economic growth. So the overall framework, which is to say domestic oil production should be part of our overall energy mix, I think continues to be the right one. Where I was wrong was in my belief that the oil companies had their act together when it came to worst-case scenarios. Now, that wasn’t based on just my blind acceptance of their statements. Oil drilling has been going on in the Gulf, including deepwater, for quite some time. And the record of accidents like this we hadn’t seen before. But it just takes one for us to have a wake-up call and recognize that claims that fail-safe procedures were in place, or that blowout preventers would function properly, or that valves would switch on and shut things off, that -- whether it’s because of human error, because of the technology was faulty, because when you’re operating at these depths you can’t anticipate exactly what happens -- those assumptions proved to be incorrect. 3 And so I’m absolutely convinced that we have to do a thorough-going scrub of that -- those safety procedures and those safety records. And we have to have confidence that even if it’s just a one-in-a-million shot, that we’ve got enough technology know-how that we can shut something like this down not in a month, not in six weeks, but in two or three or four days. And I don’t have that confidence right now.","Well, thank you for the question. It's an important one, and I appreciate you asking it directly.

Look, my focus then, and frankly, America's focus, was on energy security. We needed to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, keep our economy growing, and create good American jobs. Expanding domestic energy production, safely and responsibly, was a key part of that strategy. We weren't just drilling for the sake of drilling; we were drilling for the sake of national security and economic stability for our families.

Now, do I regret trying to find more American energy here at home? No, I don't. That was, and remains, a sound objective for our country.

What I *do* regret, deeply, is the breakdown in oversight, the dysfunction you're talking about at MMS. You put these agencies in place to do a critical job: to ensure safety, to protect the environment, to enforce the rules. And when they don't do that job, when there's a problem with the culture or the integrity within the agency, well, that's a serious problem, and it's absolutely unacceptable. We expected the regulations to be enforced, and to be enforced properly, by the people tasked with that responsibility.

So, the strategy of finding more energy here at home was right. The failure was in the execution of the oversight, making sure that industry was playing by the rules and that the regulators were holding them accountable. And that's a distinction that matters. We put our trust in those agencies to do their job, to protect the environment and ensure safety, and when that trust is broken, it's a real disappointment."
 If I could follow up -- ,Sure.,"Of course, please, go right ahead. I'm always happy to keep the conversation going and clarify any points you might have."
 Do you -- are you sorry now? Do you regret that your team had not done the reforms at the Minerals Management Service that you’ve subsequently called for? And I’m also curious as to how it is that you didn’t know about Ms. Birnbaum’s resignation/firing before -- ,"Well, you’re assuming it was a firing. If it was a resignation, then she would have submitted a letter to Mr. Salazar this morning, at a time when I had a whole bunch of other stuff going on.","Well, look, when my administration was in office, we were focused on responsible energy production and environmental protection. We put good people in charge at the Minerals Management Service, and we had clear guidelines. We always worked to ensure safety and accountability.

Now, the specific issues, the serious breakdowns that emerged there, frankly, those became clear *after* I left office. And yes, when something goes wrong like that, you step up and you say, 'We gotta do better.' So, yes, I've been clear: reforms were absolutely necessary to ensure that never happens again, to ensure we have an agency that's up to the task of both promoting energy and protecting our environment.

As for individual personnel matters, like Ms. Birnbaum's situation, those were decisions made in a *subsequent* administration. My focus was always on setting the right policy for the country, and I certainly wasn't privy to the day-to-day staffing details of another White House, years after my time."
 So you rule out that she was fired? ,"Come on, Jackie, I don’t know. I’m telling you the -- I found out about it this morning, so I don’t yet know the circumstances, and Ken Salazar has been in testimony on the Hill. With respect to your first question, at MMS, Ken Salazar was in the process of making these reforms. But the point that I’m making is, is that obviously they weren’t happening fast enough. If they had been happening fast enough, this might have been caught. Now, it’s possible that it might now have been caught. I mean, we could have gone through a whole new process for environmental review; you could have had a bunch of technical folks take a look at BP’s plans, and they might have said, this is -- meets industry standards, we haven’t had an accident like this in 15 years and we should go ahead. That’s what this commission has to discover, is -- was this a systemic breakdown? Is this something that could happen once in a million times? Is it something that could happen once in a thousand times, or once every 5,000 times? What exactly are the risks involved? Now, let me make one broader point, though, about energy. The fact that oil companies now have to go a mile underwater and then drill another three miles below that in order to hit oil tells us something about the direction of the oil industry. Extraction is more expensive and it is going to be inherently more risky. And so that’s part of the reason you never heard me say, “Drill, baby, drill” -- because we can’t drill our way out of the problem. It may be part of the mix as a bridge to a transition to new technologies and new energy sources, but we should be pretty modest in understanding that the easily accessible oil has already been sucked up out of the ground. And as we are moving forward, the technology gets more complicated, the oil sources are more remote, and that means that there’s probably going to end up being more risk. And we as a society are going to have to make some very serious determinations in terms of what risks are we willing to accept. And that’s part of what the commission I think is going to have to look at. 4 I will tell you, though, that understanding we need to grow -- we’re going to be consuming oil for our industries and for how people live in this country, we’re going to have to start moving on this transition. And that’s why when I went to the Republican Caucus just this week, I said to them, let’s work together. You’ve got Lieberman and Kerry, who previously were working with Lindsey Graham -- even though Lindsey is not on the bill right now -- coming up with a framework that has the potential to get bipartisan support, and says, yes, we’re going to still need oil production, but you know what, we can see what’s out there on the horizon, and it’s a problem if we don't start changing how we operate. Macarena Vidal. Not here? Oh, there you are.","Fired? Well, now, look, what I can tell you very clearly is this: we had a productive discussion, and she decided it was time to pursue other opportunities. We respect that decision, and we wish her nothing but the very best. That's the long and short of it."
" Mr. President, you announced -- or the White House announced two days ago that you were going to send 1,200 people to -- 1,200 members of the National Guard to the border. I want to -- if you could precise what their target is going to be, what you’re planning to achieve with that -- if you could clarify a bit more the mission that they're going to have. And also on Arizona, after you have criticized so much the immigration law that has been approved there, would you support the boycott that some organizations are calling towards that state? ","I’ve indicated that I don't approve of the Arizona law. I think it’s the wrong approach. I understand the frustrations of the people of Arizona and a lot of folks along the border that that border has not been entirely secured in a way that is both true to our traditions as a nation of law and as a nation of immigrants. I’m President of the United States; I don't endorse boycotts or not endorse boycotts. That's something that the private citizens can make a decision about. What my Administration is doing is examining very closely this Arizona law and its implications for the civil rights and civil liberties for the people in Arizona, as well as the concern that you start getting a patchwork of 50 different immigration laws around the country in an area that is inherently the job of the federal government. Now, for the federal government to do its job, everybody has got to step up. And so I’ve tried to be as clear as I could this week, and I will repeat it to everybody who’s here: We have to have a comprehensive approach to immigration reform. The time to get moving on this is now. And I am prepared to work with both parties and members of Congress to get a bill that does a good job securing our borders; holds employers accountable; makes sure that those who have come here illegally have to pay a fine, pay back taxes, learn English, and get right by the law. We had the opportunity to do that. We’ve done -- we’ve gotten a vote of a super majority in the Senate just four years ago. There’s no reason why we shouldn’t be able to recreate that bipartisan spirit to get this problem solved. Now, with respect to the National Guardsmen and women, I have authorized up to 1,200 National Guardspersons in a plan that was actually shaped last year. So this is not simply in response to the Arizona law. And what we find is, is that National Guardspersons can help on intelligence; dealing with both drug and human trafficking along the borders; they can relieve border guards so that the border guards then can be in charge of law enforcement in those areas. So there are a lot of functions that they can carry out that helps leverage and increase the resources available in this area. 5 By the way, we didn’t just send National Guard. We’ve also got a package of $500 million in additional resources, because, for example, if we are doing a better job dealing with trafficking along the border, we’ve also got to make sure that we’ve got prosecutors down there who can prosecute those cases. But the key point I want to emphasize to you is that I don’t see these issues in isolation. We’re not going to solve the problem just solely as a consequence of sending National Guard troops down there. We’re going to solve this problem because we have created an orderly, fair, humane immigration framework in which people are able to immigrate to this country in a legal fashion; employers are held accountable for hiring legally present workers. And I think we can craft that system if everybody is willing to step up. And I told the Republican Caucus when I met with them this week, I don’t even need you to meet me halfway; meet me a quarter of the way. I’ll bring the majority of Democrats to a smart, sensible, comprehensive immigration reform bill. But I’m going to have to have some help, given the rules of the Senate, where a simple majority is not enough. Last question, Major [Garrett].","Alright, thank you for the question. Let me be absolutely clear about the mission of our National Guard.

We are sending these 1,200 brave men and women of the National Guard to the border to *support* our United States Border Patrol. Make no mistake, their mission is not to engage in direct law enforcement; that remains the critical work of our highly trained Border Patrol agents. Instead, the Guard will provide essential assistance in areas like intelligence gathering, surveillance, logistics, administrative support, and operating detection systems. This critical backup will free up our Border Patrol agents, allowing them to focus on the front lines, on interdicting illegal crossings, confronting drug smugglers, and ensuring the security of our nation's perimeter. The goal is straightforward: to enhance our operational effectiveness, to provide a necessary surge capacity, and to strengthen border security until we can get a comprehensive, federal solution in place. We're going to get the job done.

Now, regarding Arizona. I have stated my concerns about the Arizona law. I understand the frustrations that led the state to act; states are on the front lines of a broken immigration system. But immigration is fundamentally a federal responsibility, and we must ensure that any law passed, whether at the state or federal level, upholds our values and does not lead to unintended consequences, such as racial profiling. That's why the Justice Department is reviewing the law carefully.

As for a boycott, my focus, and the focus of this administration, is on finding solutions and bringing people together, not on promoting division or boycotting American states. We need to work constructively with our states, with the federal government, with local communities, to fix this problem. We need comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders, enforces our laws fairly, and respects the dignity of every individual. That is how we move forward as a nation, not through division."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon. ",Good afternoon.,"Well, thank you very much. And a good afternoon to you too. It's always an honor to be here."
" Two issues. Some in your government have said the federal government’s boot is on the neck of BP. Are you comfortable with that imagery, sir? Is your boot on the neck of BP? And can you understand, sir, why some in the Gulf who feel besieged by this oil spill consider that a meaningless, possibly ludicrous, metaphor? Secondarily, can you tell the American public, sir, what your White House did or did not offer Congressman Sestak to not enter the Democratic senatorial primary? And how will you meet your levels of expressed transparency and ethics to convey that answer to satisfy what appear to be bipartisan calls for greater disclosure about that matter? Thank you. ","There will be an official response shortly on the Sestak issue, which I hope will answer your questions.","Alright, let's take these one at a time.

First, on the matter of BP and the spill in the Gulf. Look, when a company, any company, causes a disaster that threatens the livelihoods of our fellow Americans, that fouls our environment, and puts lives at risk, this government is going to act. And we're going to act with purpose.

Some folks in my administration, they use strong language. And I understand why they feel the need to convey the seriousness of our intent. When the federal government leans on a company to make things right, to clean up their mess, to compensate the people they've harmed, we're not just sending a letter. We're engaging with the full force of the law and the will of the American people behind us. So, if that means some folks view it as having a ""boot on the neck,"" well, my concern is less about the metaphor and more about the accountability.

And as for the people in the Gulf, those who are truly suffering, I understand completely why they might find any metaphor to be, as you said, ""ludicrous"" or ""meaningless."" They're not looking for colorful language. They're looking for clean beaches, they're looking for their fishing boats to go back out, they're looking for their homes and their livelihoods to be restored. They're looking for action. And let me tell you, this administration is absolutely committed to delivering that action, to holding BP accountable, and to ensuring the Gulf Coast recovers. We're focused on solutions, on getting oil out of the water, and on getting help to those who need it most. That's what matters.

Now, on your second question, regarding Congressman Sestak. I'm not going to get into the specifics of private discussions that may or may not have taken place between my White House and any member of Congress regarding their political aspirations. We operate within the bounds of the law, and we've always been committed to proper conduct and ethical standards.

When questions arise, and they always will in a vibrant democracy like ours, it is crucial that the public has confidence in their government. My administration is dedicated to transparency, and we will ensure that any matter such as this is handled appropriately and consistent with the law. We are committed to upholding the public trust. We'll always ensure that if there are any questions, they are addressed fully and consistent with the high ethical standards we expect of everyone in this government."
" From you, sir? ","You will get it from my Administration. And it will be coming out -- when I say “shortly,” I mean shortly. I don’t mean weeks or months. With respect to the first --","Alright, you want to hear from me? Well, let me lay it out for you straight. This country, folks, was built on principles of freedom and opportunity, and we're not about to forget that. We're going to keep moving forward, with American strength and American ingenuity leading the way. That's what I believe in, and that's what we're gonna do."
" Can you assure the public it was ethical and legal, sir? 6 ","I can assure the public that nothing improper took place. But, as I said, there will be a response shortly on that issue. With respect to the metaphor that was used, I think Ken Salazar would probably be the first one to admit that he has been frustrated, angry, and occasionally emotional about this issue, like a lot of people have. I mean, there are a lot of folks out there who see what’s happening and are angry at BP, are frustrated that it hasn’t stopped. And so I’ll let Ken answer for himself. I would say that we don’t need to use language like that; what we need is actions that make sure that BP is being held accountable. And that’s what I intend to do, and I think that’s what Ken Salazar intends to do. But, look, we’ve gone through a difficult year and a half. This is just one more bit of difficulty. And this is going to be hard not just right now, it’s going to be hard for months to come. The Gulf --","Look, let me be absolutely clear on this point. Everything we do in this administration, every single step, is thoroughly vetted and adheres strictly to the highest ethical standards and the letter of the law. We operate for the American people, under the Constitution, and with complete transparency. So yes, you can be absolutely certain it was both ethical and legal. We wouldn't have it any other way, and we won't settle for less."
 This -- ,This spill. The Gulf is going to be affected in a bad way. And so my job right now is just to make sure that everybody in the Gulf understands this is what I wake up to in the morning and this is what I go to bed at night thinking about.,"This... this is tremendous. A tremendous situation. Or, frankly, it's a disaster, depending on what you're talking about. But we're going to handle it, believe me. We always do. We're going to make it the best, the absolute best, you've ever seen. Nobody even comes close."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Are you willing to concede at all that what happened last night was not just an expression of frustration about the economy, but a fundamental rejection of your agenda? And given the results, who do you think speaks to the true voice of the American people right now: you or John Boehner? ","I think that there is no doubt that people’s number-one concern is the economy. And what they were expressing great frustration about is the fact that we haven’t made enough progress on the economy. We’ve stabilized the economy. We’ve got job growth in the private sectors. But people all across America aren’t feeling that progress. They don't see it. And they understand that I’m the President of the United States, and that my core responsibility is making sure that we’ve got an economy that's growing, a middle class that feels secure, that jobs are being created. And so I think I've got to take direct responsibility for the fact that we have not made as much progress as we need to make. Now, moving forward, I think the question is going to be can Democrats and Republicans sit down together and come up with a set of ideas that address those core concerns. I'm confident that we can. I think that there are some areas where it’s going to be very difficult for us to agree on, but I think there are going to be a whole bunch of areas where we can agree on. I don’t think there’s anybody in America who thinks that we’ve got an energy policy that works the way it needs to; that thinks that we shouldn’t be working on energy independence. And that gives opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to come together and think about, whether it’s natural gas or energy efficiency or how we can build electric cars in this country, how do we move forward on that agenda. I think everybody in this country thinks that we’ve got to make sure our kids are equipped in terms of their education, their science background, their math backgrounds, to compete in this new global economy. And that’s going to be an area where I think there’s potential common ground. So on a whole range of issues, there are going to be areas where we disagree. I think the overwhelming message that I hear from the voters is that we want everybody to act responsibly in Washington. We want you to work harder to arrive at consensus. We want you to focus completely on jobs and the economy and growing it, so that we’re ensuring a better future for our children and our grandchildren. And I think that there’s no doubt that as I reflect on the results of the election, it underscores for me that I've got to do a better job, just like everybody else in Washington does.","Well, look, I appreciate the question. And I hear the American people loud and clear. This is a great country, and when folks are hurting, when they're worried about putting food on the table, when gas prices are high, when they're concerned about their kids' future – that's a powerful frustration. And it's one I share. We're working hard every single day to address those economic challenges.

Now, to suggest this was a ""fundamental rejection"" of everything we're trying to do, I think that's... that's an oversimplification. My agenda, our agenda, is about securing this nation, growing our economy so everyone has a chance to succeed, and making sure our kids inherit a better country. We've made tough decisions, and sometimes tough decisions aren't popular in the moment, but they're right for the long term. This isn't about me; it's about the future of the country.

As for who speaks to the true voice of the American people... I was elected by the American people to lead this country. I travel the country, I meet with citizens from all walks of life, and I understand their hopes and their struggles. And I believe in the common sense of the American people. They want strong leadership, they want results, and they want Washington to work together to solve problems, not just point fingers.

Mr. Boehner is a leader in Congress, and he has his role. And we'll continue to work with Congress, because that's how our system works. But my job, my singular focus, is to protect and defend the American people and to ensure opportunity for every single American. And that's what I'll continue to do, day in and day out, guided by the will of the people who put me here."
 [Inaudible.] ,"Well, I think John Boehner and I and Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi are going to have to sit down and work together -- because I suspect that if you talk to any individual voter yesterday, they’d say, there are some things I agree with Democrats on, there are some things I agree with Republicans on. I don’t think people carry around with them a fixed ideology. I think the majority of people, they’re going about their business, going about their lives. They just want to make sure that we’re making progress. And that’s going to be my top priority over the next couple of years. Savannah Guthrie.","Pardon me, I didn't quite catch all of that. Could you repeat the question for us, please?"
" Just following up on what Ben just talked about, you don’t seem to be reflecting or second-guessing any of the policy decisions you’ve made, instead saying the message the voters were sending was about frustration with the economy or maybe even chalking it up to a failure on your part to communicate effectively. If you’re not reflecting on your policy agenda, is it possible voters can conclude you’re still not getting it? ","Well, Savannah, that was just the first question, so we’re going to have a few more here. I’m doing a whole lot of reflecting and I think that there are going to be areas in policy where we’re going to have to do a better job. I think that over the last two years, we have made a series of very tough decisions, but decisions that were right in terms of moving the country forward in an emergency situation where we had the risk of slipping into a second Great Depression. But what is absolutely true is that with all that stuff coming at folks fast and furious -- a recovery package, what we had to do with respect to the banks, what we had to do with respect to the auto companies -- I think people started looking at all this and it felt as if government was getting much more intrusive into people’s lives than they were accustomed to. Now, the reason was it was an emergency situation. But I think it’s understandable that folks said to themselves, you know, maybe this is the agenda, as opposed to a response to an emergency. And that’s something that I think everybody in the White House understood was a danger. We thought it was necessary, but I’m sympathetic to folks who looked at it and said this is looking like potential overreach. In addition, there were a bunch of price tags that went with that. And so, even though these were emergency situations, people rightly said, gosh, we already have all this debt, we already have these big deficits; this is potentially going to compound it, and at what point are we going to get back to a situation where we’re doing what families all around the country do, which is make sure that if you spend something you know how to pay for it -- as opposed to racking up the credit card for the next generation. And I think that the other thing that happened is that when I won election in 2008, one of the reasons I think that people were excited about the campaign was the prospect that we would change how business is done in Washington. And we were in such a hurry to get things done that we didn’t change how things got done. And I think that frustrated people. I’m a strong believer that the earmarking process in Congress isn’t what the American people really want to see when it comes to making tough decisions about how taxpayer dollars are spent. And I, in the rush to get things done, had to sign a bunch of bills that had earmarks in them, which was contrary to what I had talked about. And I think folks look at that and they said, gosh, this feels like the same partisan squabbling, this seems like the same ways of doing business as happened before. And so one of the things that I’ve got to take responsibility for is not having moved enough on those fronts. And I think there is an opportunity to move forward on some of those issues. My understanding is Eric Cantor today said that he wanted to see a moratorium on earmarks continuing. That’s something I think we can -- we can work on together.","Well, look, that's just typical fake news, believe me. That's what they want you to think. It's a very dishonest question. When we talk about policy, we had the greatest policies, the best policies this country has ever seen. Nobody's done more for the economy, for our military, for securing our border. We had tremendous success, unbelievable success.

Now, people are frustrated, I understand that. They're frustrated with inflation, they're frustrated with open borders, they're frustrated with the chaos in the world, things that weren't happening when I was president, believe me.

And sometimes, maybe, just maybe, the fake news media, they don't want to tell the truth about the incredible policies we put in place. They twist things, they lie, they make it sound different than it is. So if there's a communication issue, it's often because you have a very dishonest media that doesn't want the truth to get out.

But to say we're not reflecting? Nobody reflects more than I do. We're always looking, always thinking, always strategizing how to make America great again. But the core policies, the things we did, they worked. They were tremendous. And the people know it. They see the difference. They see what's happening now compared to what we had. So no, I think the voters understand perfectly well who's getting it, and it's not the people running things right now."
 Would you still resist the notion that voters rejected the policy choices you made? ,"Well, Savannah, I think that what I think is absolutely true is voters are not satisfied with the outcomes. If right now we had 5 percent unemployment instead of 9.6 percent unemployment, then people would have more confidence in those policy choices. The fact is, is that for most folks, proof of whether they work or not is has the economy gotten back to where it needs to be. And it hasn’t. And so my job is to make sure that I’m looking at all ideas that are on the table. When it comes to job creation, if Republicans have good ideas for job growth that can drive down the unemployment rate, and we haven’t thought of them, we haven’t looked at them but we think they have a chance of working, we want to try some. So on the policy front, I think the most important thing is to say that we’re not going to rule out ideas because they’re Democrat or Republican; we want to just see what works. And ultimately, I’ll be judged as President as to the bottom line, results. Mike Emanuel.","Resist the notion? Let me tell you, folks, what we did for this country, the policies we put in place – they were incredible. The best policies! We had the greatest economy in the history of the world, we rebuilt our military, we secured our borders like never before. Jobs were through the roof!

So when you talk about ""voters rejected,"" you have to look at what really happened. You had the fake news media, totally corrupt, working against us from day one. They never reported the truth about how great things were. You had the deep state, the swamp, fighting us every single step of the way. And then you had, frankly, a rigged election. Everyone knows it. Millions of votes! A total mess.

The *real* people, the true patriots, they loved our policies. They still do! Look at the support, the crowds, bigger than ever before. They understood that we were putting America First.

So no, I wouldn't accept that voters ""rejected"" our policies. Our policies were winners. They were fantastic for America. What happened was a disgrace, a total setup, but it certainly wasn't a rejection of the policies that made our country so strong and so respected again. Believe me!"
" Thank you, Mr. President. Health care -- as you’re well aware, obviously, a lot of Republicans ran against your health care law. Some have called for repealing the law. I’m wondering, sir, if you believe that health care reform that you worked so hard on is in danger at this point, and whether there’s a threat, as a result of this election. ","Well, I know that there’s some Republican candidates who won last night who feel very strongly about it. I’m sure that this will be an issue that comes up in discussions with the Republican leadership. As I said before, though, I think we’d be misreading the election if we thought that the American people want to see us for the next two years relitigate arguments that we had over the last two years. With respect to the health care law, generally -- and this may go to some of the questions that Savannah was raising -- you know, when I talk to a woman from New Hampshire who doesn’t have to mortgage her house because she got cancer and is seeking treatment but now is able to get health insurance, when I talk to parents who are relieved that their child with a preexisting condition can now stay on their policy until they’re 26 years old and give them time to transition to find a job that will give them health insurance, or the small businesses that are now taking advantage of the tax credits that are provided -- then I say to myself, this was the right thing to do. Now, if the Republicans have ideas for how to improve our health care system, if they want to suggest modifications that would deliver faster and more effective reform to a health care system that has been wildly expensive for too many families and businesses and certainly for our federal government, I’m happy to consider some of those ideas. You know, for example, I know one of the things that’s come up is that the 1099 provision in the health care bill appears to be too burdensome for small businesses. It just involves too much paperwork, too much filing. It’s probably counterproductive. It was designed to make sure that revenue was raised to help pay for some of the other provisions, but if it ends up just being so much trouble that small businesses find it difficult to manage, that's something that we should take a look at. So there are going to be examples where I think we can tweak and make improvements on the progress that we’ve made. That's true for any significant piece of legislation. But I don't think that if you ask the American people, should we stop trying to close the doughnut hole that will help senior citizens get prescription drugs, should we go back to a situation where people with preexisting conditions can’t get health insurance, should we allow insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick even though you’ve been paying premiums -- I don't think that you’d have a strong vote for people saying those are provisions I want to eliminate.","Well, thank you for the question. And it's an important one, because healthcare, for every single American, is just vital. We all want our families to have access to good doctors, good hospitals, and the peace of mind that comes with knowing you're covered.

Now, regarding *that* particular law... Look, I understand the intentions were, perhaps, noble. But let's be honest about the reality for countless American families and small businesses. Premiums have gone up, choices have gone down, and for too many, the promises simply haven't been kept. We've seen a federal takeover that's just not delivering the affordable, quality care people need and deserve.

So, is it in danger? I would argue that the real danger lies in *keeping* a system that is failing so many. The ""threat"" isn't to a piece of legislation, but to the wallets and health of everyday Americans who are struggling under its mandates and skyrocketing costs.

My administration believes in a different path. We believe in patient-centered healthcare. We believe in empowering individuals, not Washington bureaucrats. We believe in fostering competition among insurers, so you have real choices. We can protect those with pre-existing conditions – and we absolutely must – without strangling our economy or taking away people's doctors. We can promote state innovation, expand health savings accounts, and bring common-sense reforms that actually drive down costs and improve care.

The American people deserve a healthcare system that's built on freedom, choice, and affordability. They deserve a plan that works for them, not the government. And that's what we're committed to delivering. The goal isn't just to talk about healthcare, it's to deliver results that make a real difference in people's lives."
" According to some exit polls, sir, about one out of two voters apparently said that they would like to either see it overturned or repealed. Are you concerned that that may embolden voters who are from the other party perhaps? ","Well, it also means one out of two voters think it was the right thing to do. And obviously this is an issue that has been contentious. But as I said, I think what's going to be useful is for us to go through the issues that Republicans have issues on -- not sort of talking generally, but let’s talk specifics. Does this particular provision -- when it comes to preexisting conditions, is this something you’re for or you’re against? Helping seniors get their prescription drugs -- does that make sense or not? And if we take that approach -- which is different from campaigning -- I mean, this is now governing -- then I think that we can continue to make some progress and find some common ground. Chip Reid.","Well, look, these exit polls, they give us a snapshot, don't they? And in a country as diverse as ours, you're always going to have strong opinions on important issues. That's the beauty of our democracy, folks. People have a right to express themselves, and it's vital that their voices are heard through the ballot box.

My job, and the job of this administration, is to make the decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest of the American people—for *all* Americans. We've got a responsibility to govern, not just for some, but for everyone, and to uphold the principles that make this country strong and free.

As for emboldening the other party, well, that's just politics, isn't it? Our democracy thrives on robust debate. They'll always make their case, and we'll certainly make ours. We believe strongly in the path we've chosen, and we're confident that with continued dialogue and clear leadership, the American people will ultimately understand why it's the right course for the nation. We're focused on governing and getting things done for the good of this country."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Republicans say more than anything else what this election was about was spending. And they say it will be when hell freezes over that they will accept anything remotely like a stimulus bill or any kind of a proposal you have out there to stimulate job growth through spending. Do you accept the fact that any kind of spending to create jobs is dead at this point? And if so, what else can government do to create jobs, which is the number one issue? ","Well, I think this is going to be an important question for Democrats and Republicans. I think the American people are absolutely concerned about spending and debt -- and deficits. And I’m going to have a deficit commission that is putting forward its ideas. It’s a bipartisan group that includes Republican and Democratic members of Congress. Hopefully they were able to arrive at some consensus on some areas where we can eliminate programs that don’t work, cut back on government spending that is inefficient, can streamline government, but isn’t cutting into the core investments that are going to make sure that we are a competitive economy that is growing and providing opportunity for years to come. So the question I think that my Republican friends and me and Democratic leaders are going to have answer is, what are our priorities? What do we care about? And that’s going to be a tough debate, because there are some tough choices here. We already had a big deficit that I inherited, and that has been made worse because of the recession. As we bring it down, I want to make sure that we’re not cutting into education that is going to help define whether or not we can compete around the world. I don’t think we should be cutting back on research and development, because if we can develop new technologies in areas like clean energy, that could make all the difference in terms of job creation here at home. I think the proposal that I put forward with respect to infrastructure is one that historically we’ve had bipartisan agreement about. And we should be able to agree now that it makes no sense for China to have better rail systems than us, and Singapore having better airports than us. And we just learned that China now has the fastest supercomputer on Earth -- that used to be us. They’re making investments because they know those investments will pay off over the long term. And so in these budget discussions, the key is to be able to distinguish between stuff that isn’t adding to our growth, isn’t an investment in our future, and those things that are absolutely necessary for us to be able to increase job growth in the future as well. Now, the single most important thing I think we need to do economically -- and this is something that has to be done during the lame duck session -- is making sure that taxes don’t go up on middle-class families next year. And so we’ve got some work to do on that front to make sure that families not only aren't seeing a higher tax burden -- which will automatically happen if Congress doesn’t act -- but also making sure that business provisions that historically we have extended each year that, for example, provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States in research and development, that those are extended. I think it makes sense for us to extend unemployment insurance because there are still a lot of folks out there hurting. So there are some things that we can do right now that will help sustain the recovery and advance it, even as we’re also sitting down and figuring out, okay, over the next several years what kinds of budget cuts can we make that are intelligent, that are smart, that won’t be undermining our recovery but, in fact, will be encouraging job growth.","Well, look, thank you very much for that question. It's a very, very important question. Creating jobs, that's what we do, and frankly, nobody's done it better. We built the greatest economy, the greatest job market, in the history of the world before, you know, what happened.

Now, when Republicans talk about spending, and they're very right to talk about it, they're talking about *wasteful* spending. They're talking about throwing money away on bad programs, on things that don't help the American people, bad deals that hurt our country. And frankly, that kind of spending, yes, that should be dead. That *is* dead. We don't want to do that. We have to be smart with the taxpayer dollar.

But do I accept the idea that *any kind* of spending to create jobs is dead? No, no, I don't accept that at all. We make strategic investments. We build things. We fix our crumbling infrastructure, which is a big thing. But we do it smart, we do it with great deals, we do it efficiently, not throwing money away like some people want to do.

Now, what else can government do? A tremendous amount, believe me.
First, we did the biggest tax cuts in history. And when you cut taxes for businesses, they don't send that money to some other country. They invest it right here in America. They expand, they innovate, and they hire American workers. It's very simple.
Then, we cut regulations, thousands and thousands of them, regulations that were strangling our businesses, making it impossible for them to compete. We got rid of the red tape, and that unleashed American enterprise, truly unleashed it. Businesses could build, they could grow, they could hire.
And trade, very big on trade. We brought manufacturing jobs back to America. We made great new trade deals, fair deals, deals that put American workers first, not last. We stopped other countries from taking advantage of us, and those jobs, those manufacturing jobs, they came roaring back.
We unleashed American energy, creating tremendous jobs in that sector, and making us totally energy independent.

So, it's about empowering businesses, getting government out of the way where it doesn't need to be, cutting taxes, cutting regulations, making fair trade deals, and always putting America First. That's how you create millions of jobs, the best jobs, the greatest jobs our country has ever seen. And we did it, and we'll do it again."
" But most of those things that you just called investments they call wasteful spending and they say it’s dead on arrival. It sounds like -- without their support, you can’t get any of it through. ","Well, what is absolutely true is, is that without any Republican support on anything, then it’s going to be hard to get things done. But I’m not going to anticipate that they’re not going to support anything. I think that part of the message sent to Republicans was we want to see stronger job growth in this country. And if there are good ideas about putting people to work that traditionally have garnered Republican support and that don’t add to the deficit, then my hope is and expectation is, is that that’s something they’re willing to have a serious conversation about. When it comes to, for example, the proposal we put forward to accelerate depreciation for business, so that if they’re building a plant or investing in new equipment next year, that they can take a complete write-off next year, get a huge tax break next year, and that would then encourage a lot of businesses to get off the sidelines -- that's not historically considered a liberal idea. That's actually an idea that business groups and Republicans I think have supported for a very long time. So again, the question is going to be do we all come to the table with an open mind and say to ourselves, what do we think is actually going to make a difference for the American people? That's how we’re going to be judged over the next couple of years. Peter Baker.","Well, now, hold on a minute. That's a classic Washington dance, isn't it? One side calls it 'investments,' the other side calls it 'wasteful spending.' But let me tell you something, when we're talking about making sure our kids get a good education, or keeping our military the strongest in the world, or building the infrastructure our economy needs to compete – that's not 'wasteful spending.' That's investing in the future of this great country.

Now, 'dead on arrival'? That's a strong statement. But I've seen things declared 'dead on arrival' many a time in this town only for them to get up and walk right into law a few months later. Because here's the deal: ultimately, it's not about what a few folks in Washington say in a press conference. It's about what the American people need and what they expect from their leadership.

You don't just give up. You make your case, you talk to the American people, you build coalitions. You sit down with folks, even the ones who are hollering the loudest, and you find common ground where you can. Maybe you don't get everything you want, but you get something done for the good of the country. That's leadership. You don't just throw in the towel because someone says it's 'dead on arrival.' We've got a job to do, and we'll keep pushing to get it done."
" Thank you, Mr. President. After your election two years ago, when you met with Republicans you said that, in discussing what policies might go forward, that elections have consequences, and that you pointed out that you had won. I wonder what consequences you think this election should have then, in terms of your policies. Are there areas that you’re willing -- can you name today areas that you would be willing to compromise on that you might not have been willing to compromise on in the past? ","Well, I think I’ve been willing to compromise in the past and I'm going to be willing to compromise going forward on a whole range of issues. Let me give you an example -- the issue of energy that I just mentioned. I think there are a lot of Republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the House last year. And so it’s doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the House this year or next year or the year after. But that doesn't mean there isn't agreement that we should have a better energy policy. And so let’s find those areas where we can agree. We’ve got, I think, broad agreement that we’ve got terrific natural gas resources in this country. Are we doing everything we can to develop those? There's a lot of agreement around the need to make sure that electric cars are developed here in the United States, that we don't fall behind other countries. Are there things that we can do to encourage that? And there's already been bipartisan interest on those issues. There's been discussion about how we can restart our nuclear industry as a means of reducing our dependence on foreign oil and reducing greenhouse gases. Is that an area where we can move forward? We were able, over the last two years, to increase for the first time in 30 years fuel-efficiency standards on cars and trucks. We didn’t even need legislation. We just needed the cooperation of automakers and autoworkers and investors and other shareholders. And that's going to move us forward in a serious way. So I think when it comes to something like energy, what we’re probably going to have to do is say here are some areas where there's just too much disagreement between Democrats and Republicans, we can’t get this done right now, but let’s not wait. Let’s go ahead and start making some progress on the things that we do agree on, and we can continue to have a strong and healthy debate about those areas where we don’t.","Well, thank you for that question. It's an important one, and it goes right to the heart of our democratic process. You're absolutely right, elections *do* have consequences. The American people speak, and when they speak, we in Washington, D.C., have a duty to listen very carefully.

I believe the message from the voters this time around is clear: they want us to work together. They sent a signal that they expect us to put aside partisan differences and deliver results for the country. And that's exactly what I intend to do.

My job, as your President, remains steadfast: to protect our nation, to strengthen our economy, and to ensure every American has a fair shot at prosperity. Those fundamental goals don't change.

Now, am I willing to compromise? Look, I've always said I'm willing to sit down with anyone, from either side of the aisle, who is serious about solving the big challenges facing America. I believe in finding common ground. I believe in honest debate.

So, yes, I am absolutely willing to discuss how we can move forward on issues like ensuring our economic future, managing our national debt, or strengthening our education system. I'm willing to hear new ideas, and I'm willing to work with the other party to achieve solutions that benefit the American people.

I wouldn't point to specific policy reversals today, because my commitment to the principles that guided my administration remains strong. But I *am* willing to look for bipartisan paths to achieve those goals. That means being open to different approaches, listening to concerns, and finding the best way forward *together*. That's what leadership demands, and that's what the American people deserve."
 Is there anything in the “Pledge to America” that you think you can support? ,"You know, I’m sure there are going to be areas, particularly around, for example, reforming how Washington works, that I’ll be interested in. I think the American people want to see more transparency, more openness. As I said, in the midst of economic crisis, I think one of the things I take responsibility for is not having pushed harder on some of those issues. And I think if you take Republicans and Democrats at their word this is an area that they want to deliver on for the American people, I want to be supportive of that effort. Jake Tapper.","Well now, the ""Pledge to America"" – that was the Republican platform back in 2010, put together by Speaker Boehner and his team. It had a lot of good intentions, aimed at getting our economy moving and bringing some fiscal discipline back to Washington.

And you know, there's a lot in there that resonates with the common-sense conservative principles I believe in. Things like **cutting spending** and getting our national debt under control, that's always a worthy goal. We need to be good stewards of the taxpayer dollar. And **reducing taxes** to spur economic growth and let folks keep more of their hard-earned money – that's a philosophy I certainly championed during my time in office. We saw what a boost that gave our economy.

They also talked a lot about **job creation** and making sure America remains the best place in the world for innovation and entrepreneurship. That means reducing unnecessary regulations and fostering an environment where businesses can thrive and create opportunities for our citizens. And of course, **strong national defense** – always essential for our security and for projecting American strength and values around the world.

Governing is always a tough business, and getting these things done requires grit and a willingness to work together. But the core ideas in that Pledge – fiscal responsibility, economic freedom, and a strong America – those are values that any good Republican, and frankly, any good American, can find plenty to support."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I have a policy question and a personal one. The policy question is, you talked about how the immediate goal is the Bush tax cuts and making sure that they don’t expire for those who earn under $200,000, $250,000. Republicans disagree with that strongly. They want all of the Bush tax cuts extended. Are you willing to compromise on that? Are you willing to negotiate at all, for instance, allow them to expire for everyone over $1 million? Where are you willing to budge on that? And the second one is, President Bush when he went through a similar thing came out and he said this was a “thumpin’.” You talked about how it was humbling, or you alluded to it perhaps being humbling. And I’m wondering, when you call your friends, like Congressman Perriello or Governor Strickland, and you see 19 state legislatures go to the other side, governorships in swing states, the Democratic Party set back, what does it feel like? 0 ","It feels bad. You know, the toughest thing over the last couple of days is seeing really terrific public servants not have the opportunity to serve anymore, at least in the short term. And you mentioned -- there are just some terrific members of Congress who took really tough votes because they thought it was the right thing, even though they knew this could cause them political problems, and even though a lot of them came from really tough swing districts or majority-Republican districts. And the amount of courage that they showed and conviction that they showed is something that I admire so much. I can’t overstate it. And so there is a not only sadness about seeing them go, but there’s also a lot of questioning on my part in terms of could I have done something differently or done something more so that those folks would still be here. It’s hard. And I take responsibility for it in a lot of ways. I will tell you, they’ve been incredibly gracious when I have conversations with them. And what they’ve told me is, you know, we don’t have regrets because I feel like we were doing the right thing. And they may be just saying that to make me feel better, which, again, is a sign of their character and their class. And I hope a lot of them continue to pursue public service because I think they’re terrific public servants. With respect to the tax cut issue, my goal is to make sure that we don’t have a huge spike in taxes for middle-class families. Not only would that be a terrible burden on families who are already going through tough times, it would be bad for our economy. It is very important that we’re not taking a whole bunch of money out of the system from people who are most likely to spend that money on goods, services, groceries, buying a new winter coat for the kids. That’s also why I think unemployment insurance is important. Not only is it the right thing to do for folks who are still looking for work and struggling in this really tough economy, but it’s the right thing to do for the economy as a whole. So my goal is to sit down with Speaker-elect Boehner and Mitch McConnell and Harry and Nancy sometime in the next few weeks and see where we can move forward in a way that, first of all, does no harm; that extends those tax cuts that are very important for middle-class families; also extends those provisions that are important to encourage businesses to invest, and provide businesses some certainty over the next year or two. And how that negotiation works itself out I think is too early to say. But this is going to be one of my top priorities, and my hope is, is that given we all have an interest in growing the economy and encouraging job growth, that we’re not going to play brinksmanship but instead we’re going to act responsibly.","Well, thank you for those thoughtful questions. Always good to talk about policy and about the real human side of this job.

First, on the policy question, these ""Bush tax cuts"" – which, of course, came after my time in the Oval Office – they're just another chapter in the long-running debate we've always had in this country: how do we balance fiscal responsibility with economic growth, and how do we make sure our tax system works for all Americans?

My view has always been consistent: we've got to empower the middle class. Making sure those tax cuts don't expire for families earning under $200,000 or $250,000, that's absolutely essential. Those folks, they're the engine of our economy. They spend that money, they invest it in their kids, they support local businesses. That's a direct shot in the arm for Main Street.

Now, my Republican friends, they always want to extend cuts for everybody, saying it helps job creators. And I understand that argument. But you know, when I was President, we actually made the decision to raise taxes on the very wealthiest, and we oversaw one of the greatest periods of job creation and prosperity in American history. My concern with simply extending all the cuts, or especially with letting them expire only for those earning over $1 million, is that you have to look at the whole picture. Is it fair? Is it fiscally sustainable? And does it truly lead to broad-based prosperity, or does it just add to the deficit and exacerbate inequality?

Am I willing to compromise? Look, I've always believed that compromise isn't a dirty word, it's how you get things done for the American people. We need to sit down, both sides, and find a solution that prevents a tax hike on the middle class, strengthens our economy for the long term, and makes sure we're being responsible with the nation's checkbook. I'm always ready to negotiate in good faith to protect the middle class and secure our future.

And as for your second question, that's a very personal one, and it brings back a lot of memories. President Bush was right when he called it a ""thumpin'."" And ""humbling"" is absolutely the right word. I went through something very similar in 1994, when we lost Congress, lost governorships, state legislatures. It felt like the ground had shifted beneath our feet.

When you call up good friends like a Tom Perriello or a Ted Strickland – and they are good men, good public servants – and you hear about their struggles, and you see the Democratic Party suffer those kinds of setbacks across 19 state legislatures, governorships in key swing states, it hits you right in the gut. You feel that disappointment, not just for them personally, but for all the people they were trying to help, for the vision you were trying to advance.

It's a very sobering experience. It forces you to listen even more intently, to re-evaluate everything. You ask yourself, ""What did we miss? Where did we lose connection with the American people?"" It's a powerful reminder that no matter how good you think your ideas are, the people are ultimately in charge. And if they decide to go in a different direction, you have to respect that. You have to learn from it, understand their concerns, and work even harder to articulate your vision and prove that you can still deliver for them. It's a tough lesson, but it's an essential one for any leader in a democracy. And you get back up, dust yourself off, and keep fighting for what you believe in."
 So you’re willing to negotiate? ,Absolutely. 1 Laura Meckler.,"Well, now, I've always believed you've got to be open to dialogue. Diplomacy is a powerful tool, and a president always has to be willing to sit down and talk.

But let's be very clear: any negotiation we engage in has to be serious, it has to be principled, and most importantly, it has to serve the vital interests of the American people. We're not going to negotiate for the sake of it, but if there's a genuine path to secure our nation's future and advance our values, then you bet we're willing to talk."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You said earlier that it was clear that Congress was rejecting the idea of a cap-and-trade program, and that you wouldn’t be able to move forward with that. Looking ahead, do you feel the same way about EPA regulating carbon emissions? Would you be open to them doing essentially the same thing through an administrative action, or is that off the table, as well? And secondly, just to follow up on what you said about changing the way Washington works, do you think that -- you said you didn’t do enough to change the way things were handled in this city. Some of -- in order to get your health care bill passed you needed to make some of those deals. Do you wish, in retrospect, you had not made those deals even if it meant the collapse of the program? ","I think that making sure that families had security and were on a trajectory to lower health care costs was absolutely critical for this country. But you are absolutely right that when you are navigating through a House and a Senate in this kind of pretty partisan environment that it’s a ugly mess when it comes to process. And I think that is something that really affected how people viewed the outcome. That is something that I regret -- that we couldn’t have made the process more -- healthier than it ended up being. But I think the outcome was a good one. With respect to the EPA, I think the smartest thing for us to do is to see if we can get Democrats and Republicans in a room who are serious about energy independence and are serious about keeping our air clean and our water clean and dealing with the issue of greenhouse gases -- and seeing are there ways that we can make progress in the short term and invest in technologies in the long term that start giving us the tools to reduce greenhouse gases and solve this problem. The EPA is under a court order that says greenhouse gases are a pollutant that fall under their jurisdiction. And I think one of the things that's very important for me is not to have us ignore the science, but rather to find ways that we can solve these problems that don’t hurt the economy, that encourage the development of clean energy in this country, that, in fact, may give us opportunities to create entire new industries and create jobs that -- and that put us in a competitive posture around the world. So I think it’s too early to say whether or not we can make some progress on that front. I think we can. Cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat; it was not the only way. It was a means, not an end. And I’m going to be looking for other means to address this problem. And I think EPA wants help from the legislature on this. I don’t think that the desire is to somehow be protective of their powers here. I think what they want to do is make sure that the issue is being dealt with. 2 Ed Henry.","Alright, thank you very much. Good questions.

First off, on the EPA. Look, when Congress spoke clearly on cap-and-trade, they made their position known, and I respect that. Now, about the EPA regulating carbon emissions administratively – that’s a different can of worms, but it comes down to the same principle, doesn't it? We've got to be smart about this. We need to protect our environment, absolutely, but we also need to protect our economy and our jobs. You can’t just have administrative agencies trying to legislate from the bureaucracy, bypassing the will of the people and their elected representatives. That's not how our system works. We need common-sense solutions, not backdoor regulations that cripple American businesses and raise energy costs for hardworking families. We should be focused on American innovation, American technology, and American energy independence, not on stifling our growth with more red tape. So, if it looks like they're trying to ram through the same old policies without Congress having its say, that's something we'd have to look at very, very carefully. We're about smart policy, not overreach.

And on your second point, about changing Washington and the deals for the healthcare bill. You know, when you're sitting in this chair, trying to do big things for the American people – things that truly make a difference in their lives, like making healthcare more accessible and affordable – you're up against the realities of this town. Washington is a tough place. You fight, you negotiate, you twist arms, you make compromises. Is it always pretty? No, it's not. Do I wish we lived in a world where everyone just saw eye-to-eye and we could pass major legislation without any give-and-take? Absolutely. But that's not the real world.

We got the job done for millions of Americans who needed help, and sometimes, that means making difficult decisions and bringing people together, even if it’s uncomfortable. You always look back and you think about how you could’ve done things differently, how you could’ve done them better. That’s just part of the job. But the mission was critical, and we pushed through to deliver for the American people. We made progress. And I'll always believe that progress, even if it comes with some tough compromises, is better than standing still."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to do a personal and policy one as well. On personal, you had a lot of fun on the campaign trail by saying that the Republicans were drinking a Slurpee and sitting on the sidelines while you were trying to pull the car out of the ditch. But the point of the story was that you said if you want to go forward, you put the car in “D”; if you want to go backwards, you put it in “R.” Now that there are least 60 House districts that seem to have rejected that message, is it possible that there are a majority of Americans who think your policies are taking us in reverse? And what specific changes will you make to your approach to try to fix that and better connect with the American people? And just on a policy front, “don’t ask, don’t tell” is something that you promised to end. And when you had 60 votes and 59 votes in the Senate -- it’s a tough issue -- you haven’t been able to do it. Do you now have to tell your liberal base that with maybe 52 or 53 votes in the Senate, you’re just not going to be able to get it done in the next two years? ","Well, let me take the second issue first. I’ve been a strong believer in the notion that if somebody is willing to serve in our military, in uniform, putting their lives on the line for our security, that they should not be prevented from doing so because of their sexual orientation. And since there’s been a lot of discussion about polls over the last 48 hours, I think it’s worth noting that the overwhelming majority of Americans feel the same way. It’s the right thing to do. Now, as Commander-in-Chief, I’ve said that making this change needs to be done in an orderly fashion. I’ve worked with the Pentagon, worked with Secretary Gates, worked with Admiral Mullen to make sure that we are looking at this in a systemic way that maintains good order and discipline, but that we need to change this policy. There’s going to be a review that comes out at the beginning of the month that will have surveyed attitudes and opinions within the armed forces. I will expect that Secretary of Defense Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen will have something to say about that review. I will look at it very carefully. But that will give us time to act in -- potentially during the lame duck session to change this policy. Keep in mind we’ve got a bunch of court cases that are out there as well. And something that would be very disruptive to good order and discipline and unit cohesion is if we’ve got this issue bouncing around in the courts, as it already has over the last several weeks, where the Pentagon and the chain of command doesn’t know at any given time what rules they’re working under. We need to provide certainty and it’s time for us to move this policy forward. And this should not be a partisan issue. This is an issue, as I said, where you’ve got a sizable portion of the American people squarely behind the notion that folks who are willing to serve on our behalf should be treated fairly and equally. 3 Now, in terms of how we move forward, I think that the American people understand that we’re still digging our way out of a pretty big mess. So I don’t think anybody denies they think we’re in a ditch. I just don’t think they feel like we’ve gotten all the way out of the ditch yet. And to move the analogy forward that I used in the campaign, I think what they want right now is the Democrats and the Republicans both pushing some more to get the car on level ground. And we haven’t done that. If you think I was engaging in too much campaign rhetoric, saying the Republicans were just sitting on the side of the road, watching us get that car out of the ditch, at the very least we were pushing in opposite directions. And so --","Well, thank you for those questions. And let me say, you know, the American people have spoken, and they've sent a very clear message. And any leader worth their salt has to listen to that message, understand it, and figure out how we can all move forward together.

On the campaign trail, you're right, I used that analogy about the car, about putting it in 'D' or 'R.' And my point then, as it is now, was that we face challenges, big challenges, and we have to tackle them head-on. Now, when the election results come in, and you see the kind of shifts we've seen, it tells you that a significant number of Americans, and yes, perhaps a majority of those who voted in many districts, felt that our message wasn't getting through, or that some of our policies weren't connecting with their daily lives and their concerns. I don't believe for a minute that the vast majority of Americans want to go *backwards*. What they want is progress, opportunity, security, and they want it in a way that feels real and tangible to them.

My job, and the job of this administration, is to understand that, to re-evaluate how we communicate, and to refocus our efforts on the issues that matter most to working families across this country. That means making sure our economy continues to grow, that we create jobs, that we get the deficit down, and that we find common ground wherever we can, with whoever we can, to do the people's business. We've got a new landscape in Congress, and that means we have an even greater responsibility to reach out, to listen, to compromise, and to build a consensus around solutions that strengthen our nation. You will see a President who is absolutely committed to that. We're going to keep our focus on what unites us, not what divides us.

Now, on 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' look, I campaigned on ending discrimination in our military, and I believe in that deeply. What we did when we first came into office was to establish a policy that moved us significantly forward from outright bans. It was a compromise, a very difficult compromise at the time, but it was designed to allow patriotic Americans to serve their country without having to hide who they were, while also addressing concerns within the military leadership and Congress.

You're absolutely right, the legislative math is different now. It's a tough issue, one that evokes strong feelings on all sides, and the votes simply aren't there in the Senate today to repeal it outright. But my commitment to ensuring that every American who wants to serve their country honorably can do so, that remains absolute. We will continue to work within the confines of the current policy to ensure it's implemented fairly, and we will continue to look for ways to move towards a more inclusive military in the future, building consensus, building understanding. This is a journey, not a single step, and we will keep moving forward on it, even if the legislative path is more challenging in this new environment. We won't give up on the principle."
 -- the idea that your policies are taking the country in reverse. You just reject that idea altogether that your policies could be going in reverse? ,"Yes. And I think, look, here’s the bottom line. When I came into office, this economy was in a freefall, and the economy has stabilized. The economy is growing. We’ve seen nine months of private sector job growth. So I think it would be hard to argue that we’re going backwards. I think what you can argue is we’re stuck in neutral. We are not moving the way we need to, to make sure that folks have the jobs, have the opportunity, are seeing economic growth in their communities the way they need to. And that's going to require Democrats and Republicans to come together and look for the best ideas to move things forward. It will not be easy, not just because Democrats and Republicans may have different priorities, as we were just discussing when it came to how we structure tax cuts, but because these issues are hard. The Republicans throughout the campaign said they’re very concerned about debt and deficits. Well, one of the most important things we can do for debt and deficits is economic growth. So what other proposals do they have to grow the economy? If, in fact, they’re rejecting some of the proposals I’ve made, I want to hear from them what affirmative policies can make a difference in terms of encouraging job growth and promoting the economy -- because I don't think that tax cuts alone are going to be a recipe for the kind of expansion that we need. From 2001 to 2009, we cut taxes pretty significantly, and we just didn’t see the kind of expansion that is going to be necessary in terms of driving the unemployment rate down significantly. So I think what we’re going to need to do and what the American people want is for us to mix and match ideas, figure out those areas where we can agree on, move forward on those, disagree without being disagreeable on those areas that we can’t agree on. If we accomplish that, then there will be time for politics later, but over the next year I think we can solidify this recovery and give people a little more confidence out there. 4 Hans Nichols.","Reverse? My friend, that's just plain wrong, and frankly, it's a ridiculous notion. Absolutely, unequivocally, I reject that idea altogether.

We are not taking this country in reverse; we are taking it *forward*. We are talking about strengthening our economy, putting more Americans back to work, securing our borders, and ensuring that our nation remains the strongest, freest, and most prosperous on Earth. We're talking about common-sense policies that empower individuals and families, not burden them.

Anyone who says we're going backwards isn't looking at the facts, or they're looking through a very particular, often politically motivated, lens. My administration is focused on progress, on building a stronger future, and on upholding the very principles that have always made this country great. We're moving forward, with purpose and with a clear vision for a better America. No doubt about it."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I want to ask if you’re going to have John Boehner over for a Slurpee, but I actually have a serious question. ",I might serve -- they’re delicious drinks.,"(Chuckles) Well now, a Slurpee with John, that's... that's an interesting thought. Might need something a little stronger after some of those long nights in Congress, wouldn't you say? But I always appreciate a good sense of humor.

Alright, I'm ready. Lay that serious question on me. What's on your mind?"
 The Slurpee Summit. ,"The Slurpee Summit -- that’s good, Chuck. I like that.","Well now, the Slurpee Summit! That was a moment, wasn't it?

You know, sometimes the biggest challenges, the toughest disagreements, they don't get solved with fancy speeches or grand pronouncements. Sometimes, it just takes people sitting down, looking each other in the eye, and having an honest conversation over a cold drink.

That was the whole idea there – after a heated situation involving Professor Henry Louis Gates and a police officer, President Obama brought them together at the White House. The press, they called it the ""Slurpee Summit"" because of that casual, tryin'-to-find-common-ground kind of feeling. I think they actually had beer and root beer, but the spirit was the same.

It was about lowering the temperature, bridging a divide, and showing that even when things get tense, we can still talk it out, learn from each other, and try to understand different perspectives. That's the American way, isn't it? Finding a way to move forward, together."
" Since you seem to be in a reflective mood, do you think you need to hit the reset button with business? How do you plan to set that reset button with business? Would that -- would you include anything beyond your Cleveland speech, those proposals, to get them off the sidelines, get them off the cash they’re hoarding and start hiring again? Thank you. ","Yes, I think this is an important question that we’ve been asking ourselves for several months now. You’re right, as I reflect on what’s happened over the last two years, one of the things that I think has not been managed by me as well as it needed to be was finding the right balance in making sure that businesses have rules of the road and are treating customers fairly and -- whether it’s their credit cards or insurance or their mortgages -- but also making absolutely clear that the only way America succeeds is if businesses are succeeding. The reason we’ve got a unparalleled standard of living in the history of the world is because we’ve got a free market that is dynamic and entrepreneurial, and that free market has to be nurtured and cultivated. And there’s no doubt that when you had the financial crisis on Wall Street, the bonus controversies, the battle around health care, the battle around financial reform, and then you had BP -- you just had a successive set of issues in which I think business took the message that, well, gosh, it seems like we may be always painted at the bad guy. And so I’ve got to take responsibility in terms of making sure that I make clear to the business community as well as to the country that the most important thing we can do is to boost and encourage our business sector and make sure that they’re hiring. And so we do have specific plans in terms of how we can structure that outreach. Now, keep in mind over the last two years, we’ve been talking to CEOs constantly. And as I plan for my trip later this week to Asia, the whole focus is on how are we going to open up markets so that American businesses can prosper, and we can sell more goods and create more jobs here in the United States. And a whole bunch of corporate executives are going to be joining us so that I can help them open up those markets and allow them to sell their products. 5 So there’s been a lot of strong interaction behind the scenes. But I think setting the right tone publicly is going to be important and could end up making a difference at the margins in terms of how businesses make investment decisions.","Well, thank you for that question. It's a vital one, absolutely vital. You know, when I look out at our economy, at the incredible ingenuity and drive of the American people, I see a nation ready to surge forward. But I also see some hesitation, some capital sitting on the sidelines. So, do we need to hit a ""reset button,"" as you put it? I'd say we need to ignite a new era of confidence and opportunity for American businesses.

And yes, the proposals we've put forth, whether it was in Cleveland or across this great country, are absolutely foundational. But no, it's not just about one speech or one set of proposals; it's about a comprehensive, strategic approach to unlock the full potential of our private sector.

Here's how we set that reset button and get businesses hiring again:

First, and it cannot be overstated, we need **fundamental tax reform**. We're talking about making our tax code simpler, fairer, and more competitive globally. When businesses, from the smallest mom-and-pop shop to our largest innovators, know they can keep more of what they earn, they're not going to hoard it. They're going to invest it – in new equipment, in research and development, and most importantly, in **new jobs for American workers**. We need to end the incentives for companies to move their jobs and their capital overseas. We want them building and hiring right here at home.

Second, we've got to tackle the **burden of over-regulation**. Washington has created a thicket of red tape that strangles growth and innovation. We need to go through those regulations, one by one, and eliminate the ones that are unnecessary, duplicative, or simply stifle American enterprise without providing real benefit. We'll ensure smart, common-sense regulations that protect our environment and our people, but we will not allow government bureaucracy to be a barrier to job creation.

Third, we must ensure **energy independence and a stable economic environment**. Predictable, affordable energy is the lifeblood of manufacturing and transportation. And a clear, consistent economic policy from Washington gives businesses the certainty they need to make long-term investments. They need to know the rules won't change overnight.

Finally, it's about fostering an **overall climate of confidence and optimism**. Businesses respond to opportunity, not to government dictates. My administration will send a clear message: America is open for business. We will champion policies that reward entrepreneurship, innovation, and hard work. We will stand with our small businesses, who are the engine of job growth, and ensure they have access to capital and opportunity.

So, to get them off the sidelines, hoarding cash? It's not about forcing them. It's about creating an environment so incredibly attractive, so full of opportunity, that they *want* to put that capital to work. Because when businesses thrive, America thrives, and that's how we'll get our economy roaring back for every single American. Thank you."
 But do you have new specific proposals to get them off the sidelines and start hiring? ,"Well, I already discussed a couple with Chip that haven’t been acted on yet. You’re right that I made these proposals two months ago, but -- or three months ago -- but it was in the midst of a campaign season where it was doubtful that they were going to get a full hearing, just because there was so much political noise going on. I think as we move forward, sitting down and talking to businesses, figuring out what exactly would help you make more investments that could create more jobs here in the United States, and listening hard to them -- in a context where maybe Democrats and Republicans are together so we’re receiving the same message at the same time -- and then acting on that agenda could make a big difference. Matt Spetalnick of Reuters.","Absolutely! Let me tell you, we absolutely do. We know exactly how to get this economy roaring, how to get those incredible American businesses hiring again, and how to get our amazing people off the sidelines and into great jobs. Believe me.

Here are just a few specific proposals, and they're going to be tremendous:

1.  **Massive Tax Cuts, Part Two!** We are going to push for another round of tremendous, targeted tax cuts for our job creators. We saw what happened when we put more money back into the hands of our businesses, instead of letting Washington bureaucrats waste it. They invested it, they expanded, and they hired. We'll do it again, even bigger, even better. We're talking real incentives for companies to grow right here in America.
2.  **Aggressive Deregulation, Continued!** We're going to keep slashing the ridiculous, suffocating regulations that weigh down our businesses. Thousands of pages of red tape that nobody understands, making it too expensive and too complicated to innovate and grow. We're going to cut, cut, cut, and make it easier and cheaper for companies to operate and hire American workers, not spend their time filling out forms.
3.  **Unleash American Energy Dominance!** We're going to fully unleash our incredible American energy sector. When businesses have access to cheap, abundant energy, right here from our own land, their operating costs go down dramatically. That's money they can use to hire more people, to expand their operations, to invest in new technologies, instead of paying sky-high utility bills. It's smart, it's strong, and it creates jobs.

These are proven strategies, folks. We did it once, and we'll do it again. We're going to make it the most pro-business, pro-worker environment in the history of the world, and you're going to see hiring like you've never seen before. Tremendous!"
" Slow news day, huh? ","-- bring the other guy in. Obviously, there’s a big debate going on about taxes, and about the need to grow the economy and to create jobs. And just about every day this week, I’ve been making an argument as to why the agreement that we’ve struck to provide billions of dollars in payroll tax cuts that can immediately help rejuvenate the economy, as well as tax cuts for middle- class families, unemployment insurance for folks who desperately need it, credits for college, Child Tax Credits, as well as a range of business investments credits are so important to make sure that we keep this recovery moving. I just had a terrific meeting with the former President, President Bill Clinton. And we just happened to have this as a topic of conversation. And I thought, given the fact that he presided over as good an economy as we’ve seen in our lifetimes, that it might be useful for him to share some of his thoughts. I’m going to let him speak very briefly. And then I’ve actually got to go over and do some -- just one more Christmas party. So he may decide he wants to take some questions, but I want to make sure that you guys hear it from him directly. Former President Clinton: Thank you very much, Mr. President. First of all, I feel awkward being here, and now you’re going to leave me all by myself. Let me just say a couple of things. First of all, I still spend about an hour a day trying to study this economy. And I’m not running for anything, and I don’t have a political agenda. I just -- I try to figure out what to do. I have reviewed this agreement that the President reached with Republican leaders. And I want to make full disclosure I make quite a bit of money now, so the position that the Republicans have urged will personally benefit me. And on its own, I wouldn’t support it because I don’t think that my tax cut is the most economically efficient way to get the economy going again. But I don’t want to be in the dark about the fact that I will receive the continuation of the tax rates. However, the agreement taken as a whole is, I believe, the best bipartisan agreement we can reach to help the largest number of Americans, and to maximize the chances that the economic recovery will accelerate and create more jobs, and to minimize the chances that it will slip back, which is what has happened in other financial collapses. Like, that’s what Japan faced, and it’s something that we have to avoid in America. Why do I say that? First of all, because clearly the extension of unemployment, which gives people a percentage of the income they were previously making, will -- that money will be spent and it will bolster the economy for the next couple of years. Secondly, the conversion of the Make Work Pay Tax Credit, which the President passed before, which goes to -- went to 95 percent of the American people, converting that into an $120 billion one-year payroll tax relief act is, according to all the economic analyses, the single most effective tax cut you can do to support economic activity. This will actually create a fair number of jobs. I expect it to lower the unemployment rate and keep us going. Thirdly, and one thing I haven’t seen much about in the reports, this agreement will really help America over the long term, because it continues the credits for manufacturing jobs related to energy coming in to America. And I’ll remind you, just in the last two years, there have been 30 high-powered battery factories either opened or presently being built in America, taking us from 2 to 20 percent of the world’s share of that. And we’re going to probably be at 40 percent by 2014. This is a really important thing, bringing manufacturing back to America, because it’s a huge multiplier to create new jobs. So in my opinion, this is a good bill. And I hope that my fellow Democrats will support it. I thank the Republican leaders for agreeing to include things that were important to the President. There is never a perfect bipartisan bill in the eyes of a partisan. And we all see this differently. But I really believe this will be a significant net-plus for the country. I also think that in general a lot of people are heaving a sigh of relief that there’s finally been some agreement on something. But don't minimize the impact of the unemployment relief for working families, of the payroll tax relief, and of the continuation of the incentives to grow jobs, which will trigger more credit coming out of the banks. Keep in mind, ultimately the long-term answer here is to get the $2 trillion, which banks now have in cash reserves uncommitted to loans, out there in the economy again, the $1.8 trillion in corporate treasuries not now being invested out there in the economy again. I think this is a net-plus. And you know how I feel. I think the people that benefit most should pay most. That's always been my position -- not for class warfare reasons; for reasons of fairness in rebuilding the middle class in America. But we have the distribution of authority we have now in the Congress and what we’re going to have in January, and I think this is a much, much better agreement than would be reached were we to wait until January. And I think it will have a much more positive impact on the economy. So for whatever it’s worth, that's what I think.","Well, you know, sometimes a quiet day is a good day, isn't it? Gives you a chance to focus on the work that doesn't always make the headlines, the kind of work that truly moves the country forward. Believe me, there's always plenty to do behind these walls. Always."
" Mr. President. Former President Clinton: Yes. Question: First of all, a lot of Democrats on Capitol Hill say this is a bad deal; that President Obama could have gotten more. What’s your message to them? And then if I could also just ask -- well, go ahead. You can answer -- Former President Clinton: First, my message is, I don't believe that's true because in January, they will be in the majority. And this would dramatically reduce their incentive to extend unemployment benefits, to support the conversion of the Make Work Pay tax credits President Obama enacted into this payroll tax deduction, which as I said, I read all these economic studies. Every single, unbiased, economic study says the best thing you can do if you’re going to take a tax-cut path to grow the economy is to give payroll tax relief. I just got back from a trip to Asia with my foundation. Hong Kong, super free-market place, had a stimulus. Well, I guess we’re not supposed to use that word any more. You know what they did? They gave almost 10 percent of the people -- low-income, working people -- two months free rent in public housing. They gave some money to the seniors. But the most important thing they did was payroll tax relief for a year. This is -- all the people who study this believe it’s the number one thing, so I don't believe they can get a better deal by waiting. And I think the other thing that nobody is talking about, but I’m telling you it’s important, I live out there now, and I do a lot of this energy work, these tax credits have made us competitive again. I didn't see a single story that credited Senator Reid’s election with the fact that with three weeks before the election, two new plants were announced in Nevada, which has the highest unemployment rate in the state, a thousand people making LED lights, a thousand people making wind turbines for that big wind farm in Texas, both companies owned by Chinese interests who said in no uncertain terms we’re here because you decided to compete with us for the future, and you gave us tax credits so we can pay higher labor costs because we save the transportation costs because of these credits. I don't believe there is a better deal out there. Question: And then as a follow-up, you mentioned the Republican Congress taking office in January. What was your advice to President Obama today about how to deal with the Congress from the opposition party? Former President Clinton: I have a general rule which is that whatever he asked me about my advice, and whatever I say should become public only if he decides to make it public. He can say whatever he wants, but -- Question: What do you think? ","Here’s what I’ll say, is I’ve been keeping the First Lady waiting for about half an hour, so I’m going to take off, but -- Former President Clinton: I don't want to make her mad, please go.","Well, now that's a question, isn't it? And a tough one, especially when you're sitting in that Oval Office. My advice, frankly, hasn't changed much over the years, no matter which party is in the White House or which one controls the Hill.

You see, the American people, they don't send folks to Washington to bicker and grandstand. They send 'em there to get things done for the country. And when you've got a divided government, as President Obama did then, and as we've seen many times before and since, the *only* way forward is to look for that common ground.

It's about picking up the phone. It's about having those meetings, face-to-face, behind closed doors sometimes, and listening more than you talk. You've got to understand their concerns, and frankly, you've got to be willing to give a little to get a little. It's not weakness, it's statesmanship. It's leadership.

Now, that doesn't mean you abandon your principles. Not for a second. But you find those areas where your principles can align with theirs for the good of the nation. Whether it's the economy, national security, or even something smaller, there's always a path if both sides are truly committed to the country over their party.

It takes grit. It takes patience. And sometimes, it means you've got to stand firm. But always, *always*, you must remember you're serving all Americans. And they expect you to work together, not just retreat to your corners. That's how you lead."

Former President,"Well, thank you for those very thoughtful remarks. Don't you worry about feeling awkward, we're all just folks trying to do what's right for the country. And I appreciate you taking the time, an hour a day you say, to really dig into this economy. That's the kind of dedication we need, not for politics, but for results.

You know, you hit on something very important there – this agreement. It's not perfect, no agreement ever is when you've got people with different ideas coming together. But what you've laid out, it's about common ground. It's about putting the American people first.

You're right, extending unemployment benefits, that's helping folks who are hurting right now. And that payroll tax relief, getting a little more money into the pockets of working families, that's going to make a difference. And the manufacturing credits, bringing jobs back to America, building things right here at home – that's smart, long-term thinking. That's how we secure our economic future, by making things, by innovating.

You talk about a ""net-plus,"" and I agree with you completely. This isn't about partisan wins; it's about the country winning. It's about accelerating this recovery, making sure it's strong and sustainable, so more Americans can find good jobs and provide for their families. We've got to get those banks lending, get that capital flowing, get businesses investing again. That's the engine of our economy, free enterprise.

It takes courage, sometimes, to support a compromise, especially when it might not be exactly what you envisioned. But when it's for the good of the nation, when it helps people, when it strengthens our economy – well, that's what leadership is all about. So, I appreciate your frankness, your deep dive into the numbers, and your belief that this is a step in the right direction. Let's keep working together to ensure America's best days are always ahead."
" I would like to say one other thing on another subject, just to be recorded on the record. They don't need my support on this because we have some good Republican support, including the first President Bush. I think this START agreement is very important to the future of our national security. And it is not a radical agreement. Boris Yeltsin and I agreed in principle on this same reduction, and there was no way in the wide world he could get it through the Russian Duma that existed at the time in his second term. So we didn't proceed because it couldn’t be ratified there. I’m not sure the Senate would have ratified it then, but I think they will not with enough encouragement. But the cooperation that we will get from the Russians, and the signal that will be sent to the world on nonproliferation, when all these other things are going on which threaten to increase nuclear proliferation, is very important. One of the things you know is that when people fool with these weapons, they're expensive to build, expensive to maintain, and expensive to secure the material that goes into making the weapons. This is something that is profoundly important. This ought to be way beyond party. They’ve worked very hard. They’ve worked out, in my opinion, the details. And I hope it will be ratified. Question: Mr. President. Former President Clinton: Yes. Question: First of all, a lot of Democrats on Capitol Hill say this is a bad deal; that President Obama could have gotten more. What’s your message to them? And then if I could also just ask -- well, go ahead.

I don't believe there is a better deal out there. Question: And then as a follow-up, you mentioned the Republican Congress taking office in January. What was your advice to President Obama today about how to deal with the Congress from the opposition party? Former President Clinton: I have a general rule which is that whatever he asked me about my advice, and whatever I say should become public only if he decides to make it public. He can say whatever he wants, but -- Question: What do you think? ","Here’s what I’ll say, is I’ve been keeping the First Lady waiting for about half an hour, so I’m going to take off, but -- Former President","Well, you know, President Clinton always has a knack for laying things out, and he's a bright fellow.

On the START agreement, look, national security, that's paramount. Any step we can take to reduce nuclear threats, to send a clear message on nonproliferation around the world, that's a good thing. It's not about party; it's about protecting the American people and our allies. My father understood that, I understood that, and I believe in a strong military and smart diplomacy working hand-in-hand. When we can stand united on something as fundamental as keeping these dangerous weapons out of the wrong hands, that's a win for everybody.

Now, on the economy, Bill's got his ideas, and Lord knows we all want to see folks back to work, no doubt about it. But I believe firmly in giving American families and small businesses more of their own money back. Broad-based tax cuts, permanent relief, not just temporary fixes or targeted credits – that's what sparks ingenuity, that's what encourages investment, and that's what creates lasting jobs. When we trust the American people with their own dollars, they make the best decisions for growth, not the government. We unleash their potential, let them innovate, let them create.

As for getting a ""better deal,"" well, the American people spoke in that election, and they sent a clear message by putting Republicans in charge of Congress. We need to work with them, yes, but we also need to have principles. We can always do better when we stick to free-market ideals, roll back regulations, and unleash the strength of the American worker and the American innovator. Relying on foreign companies to come here just for a tax break isn't the long-term solution for American strength; it's about building American businesses from the ground up.

And as for dealing with a new Congress from the opposition party, it's always about leadership. You gotta stand firm on your principles, but you also gotta be willing to sit down and talk. The American people expect their leaders to govern, to make tough decisions. It means finding common ground where you can for the good of the country, but never compromising on the core beliefs that will make our nation stronger, more secure, and more prosperous. The American people put Republicans in charge for a reason, and it's time to deliver on those promises."
" I don't want to make her mad, please go. ","You’re in good hands, and Gibbs will call last question. Former President","Well now, I understand completely. Sometimes the best strategy is to know when to gracefully step aside. Wouldn't want to cause any unnecessary... complications.

Consider it done. We'll be moving on. You take care of things, alright?"
" Tha nk you very much, Mr. President. I’d like to follow up on the comments you just made as you try to reach a deal to raise the debt limit and cut the deficit. You keep saying that there needs to be this balanced approach of spending cuts and taxes. But Repub licans say flatly, they won’t -- ",That they don’t want a balanced approach.,"Well, thank you for that question. It's an important one, and it gets right to the heart of what we're trying to achieve here.

Now, look, I understand where my Republican friends are coming from. Believe me, I do. They're very focused on reining in spending, and frankly, that's something we *all* agree on. We absolutely have to be fiscally responsible; we owe that to our children and grandchildren.

But here's the thing. When you've got a challenge this big – raising the debt limit, cutting the deficit, securing our nation's financial future – you can't solve it with just one hand tied behind your back. We have to be serious.

A balanced approach, in my view, means exactly that: a serious, thoughtful look at where we can cut wasteful spending – and we *will* cut spending, no question – but also a responsible look at how we can generate the revenue we need to keep this country running and to make the investments that grow our economy and create jobs.

It's about shared responsibility. It's about fairness. It's about asking everyone to do their part, including those who've done very, very well. We can't just put the entire burden solely on working families, or cut essential services that people depend on, or compromise our national defense.

My job is to bring people together, to find common ground, and to get things done for the American people. And common ground, when you're talking about a challenge this fundamental, means we've got to put everything on the table. We've got to find a way to make the numbers add up, to avoid default, and to put America on a stronger, more secure fiscal path for the long haul. That's what the American people expect, and that's what we're working to deliver."
" They don’t want any tax increases, as they put it. And the House Speaker says not only that he doesn’t support that, but that plan won’t -- will not pass the House. So my question is will you insist, ultimately, that a deal has to include those tax increases that you just laid out? Is that an absolute red line for you? And if it is, can you explain to us ho w that can possibly get through the Congress? ","Look, I think that what we’ve seen in negotiations here in Washington is a lot of people say a lot of things to satisfy their base or to get on cable news, but that hopefully, leaders at a cert ain point rise to the occasion and they do the right thing for the American people. And that’s what I expect to happen this time. Call me naïve, but my expectation is that leaders are going to lead. Now, I just want to be clear about what’s at stake here. The Republicans say they want to reduce the deficit. Every single observer who’s not an elected official, who’s not a politician, says we can’t reduce our deficit in the scale and scope that we need to without having a balanced approach that looks at every thing. Democrats have to accept some painful spending cuts that hurt some of our constituencies and we may not like. And we’ve shown a willingness to do that for the greater good. To say, look, there are some things that are good programs that are nice to have; we can’t afford them right now. I, as Commander - in - Chief, have to have difficult conversations with the Pentagon saying, you know what, there’s fat here; we’re going to have to trim it out. And Bob Gates has already done a good job identifying 400 bi llion dollars in cuts, but we’re going to do more. And I promise you the preference of the Pentagon would not to cut any more, because they feel like they’ve already given. So we’re going to have to look at entitlements -- and that’s always difficult polit ically. But I’ve been willing to say we need to see where we can reduce the cost of health care spending and Medicare and Medicaid in the out - years, not by shifting costs on to seniors, as some have proposed, but rather by actually reducing those costs. Bu t even if we’re doing it in a smart way, that's still tough politics. But it’s the right thing to do. So the question is, if everybody else is willing to take on their sacred cows and do tough things in order to achieve the goal of real deficit reduction, then I think it would be hard for the Republicans to stand there and say that the tax break for corporate jets is sufficiently important that we’re not willing to come to the table and get a deal done. Or, we’re so concerned about protecting oil and gas su bsidies for oil companies that are making money hand over fist -- that's the reason we’re not going to come to a deal. I don't think that's a sustainable position. And the truth of the matter is, if you talk to Republicans who are not currently in office, like Alan Simpson who co - chaired my bipartisan commission, he doesn’t think that's a sustainable position. Pete Domenici, Republican, co - chaired something with Alice Rivlin, the Democrat, says that's -- he doesn’t think that's a sustainable position. You c an’t reduce the deficit to the levels that it needs to be reduced without having some revenue in the mix. And the revenue we’re talking about isn’t coming out of the pockets of middle - class families that are struggling. It’s coming out of folks who are doi ng extraordinarily well and are enjoying the lowest tax rates since before I was born. If you are a wealthy CEO or a health -- hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They’re lower than they’ve been since the 1950s. And you can afford it. You’ll still be able to ride on your corporate jet; you’re just going to have to pay a little more. And if we -- I just want to emphasize what I said earlier. If we do not have revenues, that means there are a bunch of kids o ut there who are not getting college scholarships. If we do not have those revenues, then the kinds of cuts that would be required might compromise the National Weather Service. It means that we would not be funding critical medical research. It means that food inspection might be compromised. And I’ve said to some of the Republican leaders, you go talk to your constituents, the Republican constituents, and ask them are they willing to compromise their kids’ safety so that some corporate jet owner continues to get a tax break. And I’m pretty sure what the answer would be. So we’re going to keep on having these conversations. And my belief is, is that the Republican leadership in Congress will, hopefully sooner rather than later, come to the conclusion that They need to make the right decisions for the country; that everybody else has been willing to move off their maximalist position -- they need to do the same.","Look, my friends, let me be very clear about this. What we've laid out isn't just about 'tax increases' or 'spending cuts' in isolation. This is about putting our nation's financial house in order. It's about securing our future, making sure our kids and grandkids aren't burdened by the decisions we fail to make today.

Now, when you talk about those revenue adjustments – and yes, my plan includes targeted measures to ensure everyone pays their fair share, closing some loopholes, making the system work better – those aren't just for the sake of raising money. They are *part* of a comprehensive package. A package that also includes very significant, very real spending cuts. Cuts that need to happen. Cuts that Washington has avoided for too long.

So, is it a 'red line'? The red line for me, for this administration, is fiscal responsibility. The red line is ensuring we have a deal that actually *solves* the problem, not just kicks the can down the road. That means it has to be balanced. It has to include both responsible adjustments on the revenue side *and* serious, meaningful spending reductions. You can't just do one and ignore the other and expect to fix our long-term challenges. That's just not serious.

And how does it get through Congress? Well, that's where leadership comes in. That's where we make the case to the American people, plain and simple. We sit down with the Speaker, with the Majority Leader, with members from both sides of the aisle, and we remind them of their responsibility. This isn't about partisan politics; this is about the country. It's about understanding that the alternative – doing nothing, letting our debt explode, jeopardizing our economic future – that alternative is simply unacceptable. We can find common ground when we put the nation first, and I have faith that ultimately, cooler heads and patriotism will prevail."
 You think they'll ultimately give in? ,My expectation is that they’ll do the responsible thing. Chuck Todd.,"Well, look, when you've got the facts on your side, and you're fighting for what's right for the American people, eventually, they *have* to come to their senses. It might take a little wrangling, a little negotiation, maybe some folks need a good look in the mirror... but make no mistake, we're gonna keep pushing.

And in the end, common sense usually prevails in this country. You gotta believe that. We're not backing down, and they know it. So yeah, I think they'll ultimately come around. They don't really have a better option when you get right down to it."
" Thank you, Mr. President. There have been a lot of questions about the constitutionality -- constitutional interpretations of a few decisions you’ve made, so I’ll just simply ask: Do you believe the War Powers Act is constitutional? Do you believe that the debt limit is constitutional, the idea that Congress can do this? And do you believe that marriage is a civil right? ","Well, that was a hodgepodge. Chuck, we’re going to assign you to the Suprem e Court, man. I’m not a Supreme Court justice so I’m not going to -- putting my constitutional law professor hat on here. Let me focus on, initially, the issue of Libya. I want to talk about the substance of Libya because there’s been all kinds of noise ab out process and congressional consultation and so forth. Let’s talk about concretely what’s happened. Muammar Qaddafi, who, prior to Osama bin Laden, was responsible for more American deaths than just about anybody on the planet, was threatening to massacr e his people. And as part of an international coalition, under a U.N. mandate that is almost unprecedented, we went in and took out air defense systems so that an international coalition could provide a no - fly zone, could protect -- provide humanitarian pr otection to the people on the ground. I spoke to the American people about what we would do. I said there would be no troops on the ground. I said that we would not be carrying the lion’s share of this operation, but as members of NATO, we would be support ive of it because it’s in our national security interest and also because it’s the right thing to do. We have done exactly what I said we would do. We have not put any boots on the ground. And our allies -- who, historically, we’ve complained aren’t willin g to carry enough of the load when it comes to NATO operations -- have carried a big load when it comes to these NATO operations. And as a consequence, we’ve protected thousands of people in Libya; we have not seen a single U.S. casualty; there’s no risks of additional escalation. This operation is limited in time and in scope. So I said to the American people, here’s our narrow mission. We have carried out that narrow mission in exemplary fashion. And throughout this process we consulted with Congress. We’ve had 10 hearings on it. We’ve sent reams of information about what the operations are. I’ve had all the members of Congress over to talk about it. So a lot of this fuss is politics. And if you look substantively at what we’ve done, we have done exactly what we said to do, under a U.N. mandate, and we have protected thousands of lives in the process. And as a consequence, a guy who was a state sponsor of terrorist operations against the Un ited States of America is pinned down and the noose is tightening around him. Now, when you look at the history of the War Powers resolution, it came up after the Vietnam War in which we had half - a - million soldiers there, tens of thousands of lives lost, h undreds of billions of dollars spent -- and Congress said, you know what, we don’t want something like that happening again. So if you’re going to start getting us into those kinds of commitments you’ve got to consult with Congress beforehand. And I think that such consultation is entirely appropriate. But do I think that our actions in any way violate the War Powers resolution? The answer is no. So I don’t even have to get to the constitutional question. There may be a time in which there was a serious que stion as to whether or not the War Powers resolution -- act was constitutional. I don’t have to get to the question. We have engaged in a limited operation to help a lot of people against one of the worst tyrants in the world -- somebody who nobody should want to defend -- and we should be sending a unified message to this guy that he should step down and give his people a fair chance to live their lives without fear. And this suddenly becomes the cause célèbre for some folks in Congress? Come on. So you ha d, what, a three - parter? What are the other two?","Thank you, thank you very much for those important questions. They touch on some fundamental aspects of our governance and our Constitution.

First, on the **War Powers Act**. Look, the Constitution is very clear: the President is the Commander-in-Chief. He must be able to act swiftly and decisively to protect American lives and American interests wherever they are threatened around the globe. Congress, of course, has a critical role, a very important role, in declaring war and funding our military. The War Powers Act itself... well, it has been a source of tension between the Executive and Legislative branches for decades, and for good reason. We operate within its framework, we respect the law, but there are times when the President's constitutional duty to protect this nation, to respond to threats, requires immediate and strong action. And sometimes, those strictures can, frankly, make that more challenging than it needs to be. It's a balance, always a balance, and one that requires constant communication between the branches.

On the **debt limit**: That is absolutely a power that Congress has. The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. So, the very *idea* that Congress can set limits on our national borrowing, yes, that is constitutional, it's well within their purview. Now, whether that power is always used responsibly, or whether it becomes a political weapon, that's a different discussion, isn't it? As President, I expect Congress to act, to do its job, and to ensure we always meet our financial obligations. Failing to do so would be catastrophic for our economy, for American families, and for our standing in the world.

And finally, on **marriage as a civil right**: Marriage is a foundational institution, a very important one for our society, historically understood in particular ways. When you talk about civil rights, the Constitution guarantees equal protection under the law for all Americans. We believe in dignity, and we believe in respect for every individual. The Supreme Court has made a ruling on this matter, a clear ruling, and as President, I uphold the rule of law. But let me be equally clear: we also must ensure, absolutely, that we protect religious freedom, which is a bedrock principle of this nation. It's about finding that crucial balance, respecting individual rights while also cherishing our fundamental liberties, including the freedom of conscience and belief."
 There is some question about the constitutionality of the War Powers Act. ,I’m just saying I don’t have to reach it. That’s a good legal answer.,"Well, you know, the War Powers Act... it's been a subject of pretty vigorous debate, truly, for every administration since its inception back in '73. And I've certainly had my thoughts on it, as have all presidents, Republican and Democrat alike.

Look, I deeply respect Congress's constitutional role in declaring war, and indeed, in oversight. That's a fundamental pillar of our democracy, and we always want to work closely with them, keeping them informed, seeking their support. But the President, as Commander-in-Chief, has a unique and solemn responsibility under Article II of the Constitution to protect our national security, to act decisively when American interests or American lives are at stake.

The challenge with the War Powers Act, as many presidents have noted, is that certain aspects of it can really strain that executive authority. When you're talking about responding to rapidly developing threats, or protecting our troops already in harm's way, the need for flexibility and the capacity to act quickly is paramount. And sometimes, the Act, as it's been interpreted and implemented, can create a real tension with that vital presidential duty.

It's a delicate balance, and one that requires both branches to understand their roles and responsibilities. While the Act aims to ensure proper checks and balances, presidents have consistently viewed some of its provisions as infringing on the constitutional prerogatives of the Commander-in-Chief. It's an ongoing conversation, to be sure, about how best to manage our foreign policy and military actions within our constitutional framework, especially in a world that often demands immediate response."
 [Inaudible.] ,"Let me start by saying that this administration, under my direction, has consistently said we cannot discriminate as a country against people on the basis of sexual orientation. And we have done more in the two and a half years that I’ve b een in here than the previous 43 Presidents to uphold that principle, whether it’s ending “don’t ask, don’t tell,” making sure that gay and lesbian partners can visit each other in hospitals, making sure that federal benefits can be provided to same - sex co uples. Across the board -- hate crimes -- we have made sure that that is a central principle of this administration, because I think it’s a central principle of America. Now, what we’ve also done is we’ve said that DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, is unc onstitutional. And so we’ve said we cannot defend the federal government poking its nose into what states are doing and putting the thumb on the scale against same - sex couples. What I’ve seen happen over the last several years, and what happened in New Yor k last week I think was a good thing, because what you saw was the people of New York having a debate, talking through these issues. It was contentious; it was emotional; but, ultimately, they made a decision to recognize civil marriage. And I think that’s exactly how things should work. And so I think it is -- I think it is important for us to work through these issues -- because each community is going to be different and each state is going to be different -- to work through them. In the meantime, we fil ed a -- we filed briefs before the Supreme Court that say we think that any discrimination against gays, lesbians, transgenders is subject to heightened scrutiny, and we don't think that DOMA is unconstitutional [sic]. And so I think the combination of wha t states are doing, what the courts are doing, the actions that we’re taking administratively, all are how the process should work.","Well now, folks, I'm afraid I didn't quite catch all of that. Sounds like we had a little bit of a... well, a bit of a hiccup there. Could you do me a favor and just say that one more time for me, nice and clear? I want to make sure I hear you right. Thank you."
" Are you at all uncomfortable that there could be different rules in different states, you know, and for somebody t o make the argument that's what we saw during segregation -- ","Chuck, I think what you’re seeing is a profound recognition on the part of the American people that gays and lesbians and transgender persons are our brothers, our sisters, our c hildren, our cousins, our friends, our co - workers, and that they’ve got to be treated like every other American. And I think that principle will win out. It’s not going to be perfectly smooth, and it turns out that the President -- I’ve discovered since I’ ve been in this office -- can’t dictate precisely how this process moves. But I think we’re moving in a direction of greater equality and I think that’s a good thing. Julianna. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. I only have a two - parter.","Well, that's a very serious question, and it brings up a very serious part of our history. Look, in this country, we've always had a system where states have their own powers, right? It's called federalism, and it's a very important concept. What works in, say, California, might not work in a place like Texas, or Florida, or Ohio. And that's often a good thing. It allows states to be laboratories of democracy, to try different approaches for their people, within the framework of the Constitution, of course.

Now, when you bring up segregation, and that was a terrible, terrible period in our history, nobody disputes that, nobody. That was about denying fundamental civil rights to people, basic human dignity, based on the color of their skin. That's not at all what we're talking about when we discuss states making different policy decisions on, for example, economic issues, or regulatory issues, or even some social issues, as long as they're within the confines of our Constitution and don't deny those fundamental, God-given rights.

The line is very clear: state differences are one thing, and they can be very productive. But denying basic rights, that's entirely different, and we fought a great fight to end that kind of injustice. We can't ever go back to that. But states having their say, that's part of what makes America great."
" Are you concerned that the current debate over debt and deficits is preventing you from taking the kind of decisive and more balanced action needed to create jobs in this country, which is the number one concern for Americans? And also, o ne of the impediments to job growth that the business community repeatedly cites is the regulatory environment. So do you think that the NLRB complaint against Boeing, that this has created some of the -- is an example of the kinds of regulations that chil l job growth, and also that you yourself have called “just plain dumb”? ","I think it’s important to understand that deficit reduction, debt reduction, should be part of an overall package for job growth over the long term. It’s not the only part of it, but it’s an important part of it.","Well, listen, that's a *great* question, a really important question. And you hit on something there that is absolutely true. The debt and deficits, it's a tremendous problem, a huge problem, believe me. And when you have people just constantly fighting, constantly squabbling over this stuff, instead of getting down to business and focusing on what matters – which is jobs for American workers – yeah, it absolutely makes it harder to take the kind of decisive action we need. It's just common sense. We need to get this country moving again, and you can't do that with all this paralysis.

But let's be very clear about what *really* stifles job growth, what really holds us back. You mentioned the regulatory environment, and you're spot on. And the NLRB complaint against Boeing? That, my friend, is exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about. I've called them ""just plain dumb"" because that's what they are! It's beyond dumb, it's ridiculous, it's an absolute outrage!

You have a great American company like Boeing, a fantastic company, creating thousands of high-paying jobs, building the best planes in the world, right here in America. And then you have the National Labor Relations Board, these unelected bureaucrats, stepping in, trying to tell them where they can and cannot build a new factory, where they can create jobs, because of some political games, some union nonsense? It's unbelievable! It's insanity!

That kind of regulation doesn't just ""chill"" job growth, it *freezes* it solid. It tells companies, ""Don't expand here. Don't build here. Take your jobs somewhere else."" And believe me, they do! We should be doing everything in our power to encourage companies like Boeing to expand and hire more Americans, not putting up these ridiculous, stifling roadblocks. It makes us uncompetitive. It sends jobs overseas. It's bad for business, and it's even worse for American workers. We need to get rid of that kind of bureaucratic garbage and let our businesses thrive. That's how you create jobs, real jobs, not by punishing success."
" Thank you very much, Mr. President. Yesterday, Admiral McRaven testified before Congress that he was concerned that there wasn’t a clear procedure to be followed if a terrorist were captured alive abroad. The administration has also been clear that it doesn’t want to continue to send suspected terrorists to Guantanamo. What message do you have for American men and women in uniform who are undertaking missions, like the very risky one to capture and kill bin Laden, about what they should do in the event that they capture someone alive? And does the lack of these clear pro cedures raise the risk that forces might be more inclined to kill suspected terrorists in the field, rather than capture them alive, thus depriving the U.S. of the intelligence that they could provide? ","Well, first of all, my top priority i n each and every one of these situations is to make sure that we’re apprehending those who would attack the United States; that we are getting all the intelligence that we can out of these individuals, in a way that’s consistent 0 with due process of law; an d that we try them, we prosecute them, in a way that’s consistent with rule of law. And, frankly, there are going to be different dispositions of the case depending on the situation. And there are going to be sometimes where a military commission may be ap propriate. There are going to be some times where Article III courts are appropriate in terms of prosecution. And we do have a process to work through all the agencies -- Department of Defense, Department of Justice, FBI, anybody else who might be involved in these kinds of operations -- to think through on a case - by - case basis how a particular individual should be dealt with. And I think that when it comes to our men and women in uniform who might be carrying out these missions, the instructions are not go ing to be based on whether or not the lawyers can sort out how we detain them or how we prosecute them. Their mission is to make sure that they apprehend the individual; they do so safely with minimum risk to American lives. And that’s always going to be t he priority, is just carrying out the mission. And that message is sent consistently to our men and women in uniform anytime they start carrying out one of these missions. But I think it’s important to understand, and the American people need to be assured that anytime we initiate a mission like this, our top priorities are making sure this person is not able to carry out attacks against the United States and that we’re able to obtain actionable intellig ence from those individuals. And so that mitigates against this danger that you’re suggesting that our main goal is going to be to kill these individuals as opposed to potentially capturing them. Okay? Mike Emanuel, FOX.","Thank you for that important question. Admiral McRaven is a patriot, a true American hero, and his concerns are serious, and we are taking them seriously. The situation with captured terrorists is complex, always has been, and we have to be smart, decisive, and adaptable in how we deal with these enemies.

Our administration has been clear: we are looking at all options. Guantanamo Bay served a vital purpose in a very dangerous time for our nation, but we need solutions that are effective, that protect American lives, and that are adaptable to the ever-changing threats we face. We're working on that every single day.

Now, to the men and women in uniform, let me be absolutely clear: You are the shield that protects our nation. Your training, your courage, your judgment in the field – these are unmatched. When you're facing down terrorists, you make critical decisions in an instant, often under hostile fire, in environments designed to kill you. Our primary mission, your primary mission, is to defend America and secure the objective, and we trust you to make those calls.

On the issue of intelligence, let me be crystal clear: Intelligence is absolutely critical. Every single piece of information we gather from a captured terrorist can save American lives, it can prevent the next attack, it can lead us to other cells and other leaders. That is why our forces are trained to capture when it is feasible, when it is safe to do so, and when it furthers our national security. We *want* that intelligence.

But let's be frank: the battlefield is not a laboratory, and it certainly isn't a courthouse. It's a dangerous place. Our troops operate under robust rules of engagement, and they must prioritize their own safety, the safety of their teammates, and the completion of their mission. They must respond to threats.

Are we developing clearer procedures? Absolutely. This is not a simple matter of paperwork; we are dealing with enemies who exploit every rule, every weakness, and who operate without any regard for human life. We are working diligently to establish a comprehensive framework that is effective, that is lawful, and that ensures we get the vital intelligence we need, all while protecting our brave service members who put their lives on the line for all of us.

We will get it right, because the security of the American people depends on it. And we will always, always stand with our warriors. Thank you."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Last week when you gave your Afghanistan drawdown speech, the word “victory,” in terms of the overall war in Afghanistan, was not in your speech. So I’m wondering, sir, if you can define for the 100,000 troops you have in harm’s way in Afghanistan “victor y” in the war, and for their families, as well, sir. ","Well, I didn't use “victory” in my West Point speech, either. What I said was we can be successful in our mission, which is narrowly drawn, and that is to make sure that al Qaeda cannot attack the United States of America or our allies or our interests overseas, and to make sure that we have an Afghan government that -- and an Afghan people that can provide for their own security. We are being successful in those missions. And the reason that we’re in a position to draw down 10,000 troops this year and a total of 33,000 troops by the end of next summer is precisely because of the extraordinary work of our men and women in uniform. What they’ve been able to do is to severely cripple al Qaed a’s capacities. 1 Obviously bin Laden got the most attention, but even before the bin Laden operation we had decimated the middle ranks and some of the upper ranks of al Qaeda. They’re having a great deal of difficulty operating, a great deal of difficulty c ommunicating and financing themselves, and we are going to keep the pressure on. And in part that's because of the extraordinary sacrifices that have been made by our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan. What we’ve also been able to do is to ramp up th e training of Afghan forces. So we’ve got an additional 100,000 Afghan troops, both Army and police, that have been trained as a consequence of this surge. And that is going to give the Afghans more capacity to defend themselves because it is in our nation al interest to make sure that you did not have a collapse of Afghanistan in which extremist elements could flood the zone once again, and over time al Qaeda might be in a position to rebuild itself. So what I laid out was a plan in which we are going to b e drawing down our troops from Afghanistan after 10 very long years and an enormous sacrifice by our troops. But we will draw them in a -- draw them down in a responsible way that will allow Afghanistan to defend itself and will give us the operational cap acity to continue to put pressure on al Qaeda until that network is entirely defeated.","Well, thank you for that question. It's an important one, and one that I think about every single day, especially when I think about our incredible troops and their families. They are the finest in the world, the finest there's ever been.

Now, when we talk about 'victory' in a war like Afghanistan, it’s not always about a traditional surrender ceremony, a flag raising over a capital city. This isn't World War II, folks. This was a different kind of war, a necessary war after what happened on 9/11.

Our mission, from day one, was to go in there, to utterly dismantle the terrorists who attacked us, and to make sure Afghanistan could never again be a safe haven to plot attacks against the American homeland. And let me tell you, our brave service members, they achieved that mission. They took the fight to the enemy, they decimated al-Qaeda, and they have kept America safe for two decades. That is a monumental achievement.

So, for those 100,000 troops, for their incredible families, I want them to know this: victory means that we accomplished our core objective. We prevented further attacks from that region. We kept America safe. And now, after immense sacrifice, after two decades of incredible service, victory also means bringing our sons and daughters home, responsibly, with honor.

We are making sure America's interests are protected, and we're ending these endless wars. That's a victory for our nation, and it's a testament to the extraordinary courage of every single man and woman who served. Thank you."
" The attack on the Intercontinental Hotel yesterday, sir? And does that concern you that Afghan forces may not be able to step up if these guys are able to atta ck a high - profile target in the nation’s capital? ","Well, keep in mind the drawdown hasn’t begun. So we understood that Afghanistan is a dangerous place, that the Taliban is still active, and that there are still going to be events like this on occasion. The question is, in terms of overall trend, is Afghanistan capacity increasing. Kabul, for example, which contains a huge proportion of the Afghan population as a whole, has been largely policed by Afghan forces for quite some time. And they’ ve done a reasonably good job. Kabul is much safer than it was, and Afghan forces in Kabul are much more capable than they were. That doesn’t mean that there are not going to be events like this potentially taking place, and that will probably go on for so me time. Our work is not done. But as I said in my speech, the tide of war is receding. We have shifted to a transition phase. And much like we’ve seen in Iraq, where we've drawn down our troops, the remainder of our troops will be coming out by the end of this year, but Iraq has been able to maintain a democratic government and to tamp down violence there -- we think a similar approach makes sense in Afghanistan. 2 But even in Iraq, you still see the occasional attack. These are still countries that are digg ing themselves out of a lot of war, a lot of conflict. They’re dangerous places. And so they’re not going to be perfectly safe, even if we were there. But we can improve the chances for the Afghan people to defend themselves. Jim Sciutto.","Look, what happened at that hotel, it's absolutely terrible. Just awful. These are bad people, very bad people, total losers, and we're going to defeat them. Believe me.

Now, about the Afghan forces, you ask? We're doing a lot for them. A tremendous amount. We're training them, we're giving them the best equipment, the best in the world. But they've got to step up. They really do. We can't be there forever, folks. We've been there a long time, too long. We're building them up, but they have to take responsibility for their own country. This attack, it just shows you that there are still bad elements, and they have to fight them. We're doing our part, believe me, we're doing more than our part. We're working towards a strong Afghanistan, but they've got to secure it themselves. Tough situation, very tough, but we're going to handle it. We always do."
" Thank y ou, Mr. President. You’re aware that Senators Kerry and McCain have a proposal on the Senate floor to give you the leeway to continue operations in Libya for a further year. You’ve just said that this, from the beginning, has been an operation limited in t ime and scope. Initially you said days, not weeks. Are you prepared, are the American people prepared for this operation, with American support, to continue for a further year? And is there any other definition of success than Qaddafi being removed from po wer? ","Well, first of all, Jim, just a slight correction. What I told the American people was that the initial phase where Americans were in the lead would take days, perhaps weeks. And that’s exactly what happened, right? I mean, after -- a round two weeks, a little less than two weeks, we had transitioned where NATO had taken full control of the operation. So promise made, promise kept. Second, I think when you have the former Republican nominee for President, John McCain, and the former nom inee for President on the Democratic side, John Kerry, coming together to support what we’re doing in Libya, that should tell the American people that this is important. And I very much appreciate their efforts in that regard. Third, when it comes to our d efinitions of success, the U.N. mandate has said that we are there to make sure that you do not see a massacre directed against Libyan civilians by the Libyan regime. The Libyan regime’s capacity has been greatly reduced as a consequence of our operation. That’s already been successful. What we’ve seen both in the East and in the West is that opposition forces have been able to mobilize themselves and start getting organized, and people are starting to see the possibility of a more peaceful future on the ho rizon. What is also true is, as long as Qaddafi is still presenting himself as the head of the Libyan government, and as long as he still controls large numbers of troops, the Libyan people are going to be in danger of counter - offensives and of retribution . So there is no doubt that Qaddafi stepping down from power is -- from the international community’s perspective -- going to be the primary way that we can assure that the overall mission of Libya’s people being protected is accomplished. 3 And I just want to point out -- I know it's something you know -- the International Criminal Court identified Qaddafi as having violated international law, having committed war crimes. What we’ve seen is reports of troops engaging in horrible acts, including potentially u sing rape as a weapon of war. And so when you have somebody like that in charge of large numbers of troops, I think it would be hard for us to feel confident that the Libyan people are going to be protected unless he steps down. Now, what that means, wheth er there’s the possibility of Libyans arriving at some sort of political settlement, that I think is something that ultimately the Libyan people are going to have to make a decision about -- because the international community is there in service of that b roader goal, of a peaceful Libya.","Well, thank you for the question. Let me be clear. When America commits its resources, when we put our servicemen and women in harm's way, we do so with very specific objectives. Now, I appreciate the hard work of Senators Kerry and McCain – good men, both of them – and their efforts to find a path forward. That's what Washington should be doing.

But let's be honest about the realities on the ground. When you're dealing with a tyrant like Qaddafi, when you're looking at a potential humanitarian catastrophe, the initial assessments, the initial timelines, they can shift. That's the nature of these complex situations. My job, and the job of this administration, is to protect American interests and to stand for freedom and security.

Are the American people prepared for this? The American people are strong. They understand that when we embark on a mission, particularly one with a humanitarian component and significant regional implications, we must see it through. But let me assure you, we are not looking for an open-ended commitment. We are not looking for mission creep. We are looking for clear objectives and a strategy to achieve them, effectively and efficiently.

And to your point about the definition of success: Make no mistake, when a leader is systematically brutalizing his own people, threatening the stability of a vital region, and defying international norms, his continued presence is a direct impediment to peace and security. Success in Libya means preventing mass atrocities, allowing the Libyan people to determine their own future, and ensuring that Libya does not become a safe haven for terrorists or a source of regional instability. And frankly, it's very difficult to achieve those goals with Qaddafi still in power, terrorizing his citizens. So, yes, his removal from power is a critical component of what success looks like for the people of Libya and for the interests of the United States. We will work with our allies to achieve that, and we will do so responsibly."
 Would you accept a political settlement with him involved as success from the American perspective? ,I would accept him stepping down so that he is not directing armed forces against the Libyan pe ople. He needs to step down. He needs to go. Laura Meckler.,"Look, when you're the President, it's never about personalities. It's about results, plain and simple.

From the American perspective, a political settlement is a success if it strengthens our nation, protects our people, advances our interests – economic, security, and our values – and brings stability where there was chaos.

It doesn't matter who's across the table; what matters is whether that deal, that agreement, genuinely delivers for the American people. If it makes America safer, more prosperous, and upholds our leadership in the world, then yes, absolutely. That's a success. Because ultimately, you've got to do what's right for the USA."
" Thank you, Mr. President. In these debt talks, would you accept -- would you like to see some sort of tax breaks aimed at stimulating the economy, even though that would of course add to the deficit itself? And I’d also like to follow up on one of your earlier answers about same - sex marriage. You said that it’s a positive step that so many states, including New York, are moving towards that. Does that mean that you personally now do support same - sex marriage, putting aside what individual states decide? Is that your personal view? ","I’m not going to make news on that today. Good try, though. And with respect to the deficit and debt talks and w here we need to go, I do think it’s important, since we’re looking at how do we reduce the debt and deficit both in a 10 - year window as well as beyond a 10 - year window, to understand that one of the most important things we can do for debt and deficit redu ction is to grow the economy. And so if there are steps that in the short term may reduce the amount of cash in the treasury but in the long term mean that we’re growing at 3.5 percent instead of 2.5 percent, then those ideas are worth exploring. 4 Obviously that was what we did in December during the lame duck session, when Democrats and Republicans came together and we said, you know what, a payroll tax cut makes sense in order to boost the economy; unemployment insurance makes sense in order to boost the e conomy. All that stuff puts money in people’s pockets at a time when they’re still struggling to dig themselves out of this recession. And so the American people have an extra thousand dollars, on average, in their pockets because of the tax cuts that we i nitiated. And that has helped cushion some of the tough stuff that happened in the first six months of this year, including the effects on oil prices as a consequence of what happened in the Middle East as well as what happened in Japan. I think that it ma kes perfect sense for us to take a look at can we extend the payroll tax, for example, an additional year, and other tax breaks for business investment that could make a big difference in terms of creating more jobs right now. What we need to do is to rest ore business confidence and the confidence of the American people that we’re on track -- that we’re not going to get there right away, that this is a tough slog, but that we still are moving forward. And I think that it makes sense, as we’re looking at an overall package, to see, are there some things that we can do to sustain the recovery, so long as the overall package achieves our goals -- the goals that I set out, which is $4 trillion within a 10 - to 12 - year window, and making sure that we’re bending the costs of things like health care over the long term.","Well, thank you for those questions. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, on the debt talks and tax breaks for economic stimulus. Look, the economy, that's always job number one for this administration. We've got to make sure that American businesses are thriving, that folks are working, and that the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well. So, yes, I absolutely believe that *smart, targeted tax breaks* can be a powerful tool for stimulating the economy. When you put more money in the hands of job creators, when you reduce the burden on small businesses, when you encourage investment, that creates jobs, that creates wealth, and ultimately, that brings in more revenue for the government in the long run.

Now, you're right, we have to be mindful of the deficit. Fiscal responsibility is absolutely critical. But sometimes, you've got to make strategic investments to get the economy moving again. And an investment in the American worker, an investment in American enterprise, that's an investment that pays dividends down the road. We're going to find that balance, but I'm a firm believer that unleashing the power of the American economy is the best path to long-term prosperity and ultimately, to tackling that debt.

Alright, on your second question, about same-sex marriage. What I said earlier, and I stand by it, is that it's a positive step when states are having these important conversations and, through their democratic processes, are making decisions that reflect the will of their people. Our system, it's a union of states, and we see states serving as laboratories for democracy on many issues.

Now, as for my personal view, I believe in the sanctity of marriage, and for me, that's a union between a man and a woman. That's a deeply held conviction for me, rooted in my faith and my principles. However, I also respect the ongoing legal processes and the decisions that states are making. Our country is always evolving, and there's a robust debate on these important social issues. I understand that. But my personal view, what I believe in my heart about the traditional definition of marriage, that has not changed."
" I'm sorry, I know you don’t want to say anything further on the same - sex marriage issue, but what you said before really led me to believe that that’s what is in your personal mind. And I’m wo ndering what's the distinction you’re drawing. ","Laura, I think this has been asked and answered. I'll -- I'll just -- I'll...keep on giving you the -- the same answer until I give you a different one, all right? And that won’t be today. Que stion : That's going to be -- [inaudible.]","Alright, I appreciate you pressing the point, and I understand why you'd be looking for clarity. When I speak on these matters, there's always a distinction I try to draw, and it's an important one, particularly when you hold the office of the President.

See, there's what an individual, a private citizen, might hold in their heart or their faith, about matters of marriage and family. And those are deeply personal beliefs, often rooted in tradition, faith, or deeply held convictions, and they deserve respect.

But then there's the role of the President of the United States. And in that role, the duty is to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land, to ensure that all Americans are treated with dignity under those laws, and to respect the decisions of the highest courts. Once a matter has been decided by the Supreme Court, for example, it becomes the settled law of the land. My job is to ensure that framework is honored, while also ensuring that people of faith continue to have the freedom to practice their beliefs.

So, the distinction, for me, lies between my personal thoughts as an individual—which I believe are best kept private on certain social issues once they've been adjudicated—and my public duty to the rule of law and the fundamental rights of all citizens within that framework. It's about respecting the process, respecting diverse viewpoints, and ultimately, respecting the law of the land."
" Thank you very much, Mr. President. First, if you receive a mandatory E - verify bill only without legalization, are you planning to veto that deal? And second, on Fast and Furious, members of Congress and the government of Mexico are still waiting for answers. Are you planning to replace ATF leadership? And when can we expect the results of the current investigatio n? 5 ","On the second question, as you know, my attorney general has made clear that he certainly would not have ordered gun running to be able to pass through into Mexico. The investigation is still pending. I’m not going to comment on a current investigation. I’ve made very clear my views that that would not be an appropriate step by the ATF, and we got to find out how that happened. As soon as the investigation is completed, I think appropriate actions will be taken. With respect to E - verify, we need comprehensive immigration reform. I’ve said it before. I will say it again. I will say it next week. And I’ll say it six months from now. We’ve got to have a system that makes sure that we uphold our tradition as a nation of laws and that we also uphold our tradition as a nation of immigrants. And that means tough border security, going after employers that are illegally hiring and exploiting workers, making sure that we also have a pathway for legal status for those who are living in the shadows right now. We may not be able to get everything that I would like to see in a package, but we have to have a balanced package. E - verify can be an important enforcement tool if it’s not riddl ed with errors, if U.S. citizens are protected -- because what I don't want is a situation in which employers are forced to set up a system that they can’t be certain works. And we don't want to expose employers to the risk where they end up rejecting a qu alified candidate for a job because the list says that that person is an illegal immigrant, and it turns out that the person isn’t an illegal immigrant. That wouldn’t be fair for the employee and would probably get the employer in trouble as well. So I thi nk the goal right now is to let’s continue to see if we can perfect the E - verify system. Let’s make sure that we have safeguards in place to prevent the kind of scenarios that I talked about. But let’s also not lose sight of some of the other components to immigration reform. For example, making sure that DREAM Act kids -- kids who have grown up here in the United States, think of themselves as Americans, who are not legal through no fault of their own, and who are ready to invest and give back to our count ry and go to school and fight in our military and start businesses here -- let’s make sure that those kids can stay. We need to have a more balanced approach than just a verification system.","Well, thank you for those questions. Let's take them one at a time.

On the matter of E-Verify, look, I've always believed we need to take a serious, comprehensive approach to immigration reform. Securing our borders, and ensuring employers are following the law with E-Verify, those are important parts of the equation. No doubt about it. But if we're going to fix this system, we have to deal with the whole picture. That means also addressing those who are already here and creating a reasonable guest worker program so people can come here legally to fill jobs Americans aren't doing. A bill that only focuses on one piece, without addressing the full scope, well, that's not a comprehensive solution. And I'd have serious reservations about signing a bill that doesn't tackle the problem in its entirety.

And on Fast and Furious, let me be clear: what happened there was a serious, serious failure. It cost lives, including a brave Border Patrol Agent, Brian Terry, and it damaged trust with our neighbors in Mexico. My expectation, always, would be that any administration, when faced with such a profound error, would conduct a thorough, transparent investigation. Accountability is paramount. As President, I would demand answers from my Attorney General and from the leadership of the ATF. Whether it's replacing leadership or holding individuals accountable, those are decisions that would be made based on the results of that investigation. The American people, and the government of Mexico, they deserve to know exactly what went wrong and what steps are being taken to ensure it never, ever happens again. I would expect those results to be delivered swiftly and openly."
" Mr. President -- Mr. President, you don't have any time line for the [inaudible] ","I don’t have an answer as to whether the investigation is completed yet, and it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment on the investigation if I don’t -- if it’s not yet completed. Jessica Yellin. Congratulation s, your first question here.","Well, look, we're absolutely committed to achieving our goals here, and we have a very clear strategy in place. We're making progress every day, and we're constantly evaluating the situation. What I can tell you is that we're focused on getting the job done right, not just quickly, and we're confident in the direction we're headed. We'll continue to keep the American people informed as we move forward."
" Thank you, Mr. President. 6 ",No pressure. You’re going to do great.,"Well, thank *you*. Always a pleasure to be with you. And six... a strong number. A very strong number indeed. We appreciate that. Thank you very much."
 Thank you. Your administration has laid out four different dates by which you’ve said that the debt ceiling must be raised or the U.S. would face potential dire consequences. Three of those dates have come and gone and we haven’t faced financial calamity. Some of your critics have argued that these are then scare tactics to force a deal. So why should the American people believe that the August 2nd deadline is the final deadline by which a deal must be raised? And would you also spell out for us what you believe will happen if the debt ceiling is not raised by that date? ,"Jessica, let’s be clear. We haven’t given out four different dates. We have given out dates that are markers for us getting into trouble. It’s the equivalent of you’re driving down the street and the yellow light starts flashing. The yellow light is flashing. Now, it hasn’t been a red light yet. S o what Tim Geithner has said is, technically speaking, we’re in a position now where we’re having to do a whole bunch of things to make sure that our bills are paid. By August 2nd, we run out of tools to make sure that all our bills are paid. So that is a hard deadline. And I want everybody to understand that this is a jobs issue. This is not an abstraction. If the United States government, for the first time, cannot pay its bills, if it defaults, then the consequences for the U.S. economy will be significa nt and unpredictable. And that is not a good thing. We don’t know how capital markets will react. But if capital markets suddenly decide, you know what, the U.S. government doesn’t pay its bills, so we’re going to start pulling our money out, and the U.S. Treasury has to start to raise interest rates in order to attract more money to pay off our bills, that means higher interest rates for businesses; that means higher interest rates for consumers. So all the headwinds that we’re already experiencing in ter ms of the recovery will get worse. That’s not my opinion. I think that’s a consensus opinion. And that means that job growth will be further stymied, it will be further hampered, as a consequence of that decision. So that’s point number one. Point number two, I want to address what I’ve been hearing from some quarters, which is, well, maybe this debt limit thing is not really that serious; we can just pay interest on the debt. This idea has been floating around in some Republican circles. This is the equivalent of me saying, you know what, I will choose to pay my mortgage, but I’m not going to pay my car note. Or I’m going to pay my car note but I’m not going to pay my student loan. Now, a lot of people in really tough situations are having to make those tough decisions. But for the U.S. government to start picking and choosing like that is not going to inspire a lot of confidence. 7 Moreover, which bills are we going to decide to pay? These guys have said, well, maybe we just pay the interest on -- for bondholders. So are we really going to start paying interest to Chinese who hold treasuries and we’re not going to pay folks their Social Security checks? Or we’re not going to pay to veterans for their disability checks? I mean, which bills, which obligations, are we going to say we don’t have to pay? And last point I want to make about this. These are bills that Congress ran up. The money has been spent. The obligations have been made. So this isn’t a situation -- I think the American people have t o understand this -- this is not a situation where Congress is going to say, okay, we won’t -- we won’t buy this car or we won’t take this vacation. They took the vacation. They bought the car. And now they’re saying maybe we don’t have to pay, or we don’t have to pay as fast as we said we were going to, or -- that’s not how responsible families act. And we’re the greatest nation on Earth, and we can’t act that way. So this is urgent and it needs to get settled.","Look, I understand why some folks might be feeling a bit of frustration, maybe even some skepticism, and our critics, they're always going to find something to criticize. That's politics. But let's be absolutely clear about this: The dates we've put forward were not ""scare tactics."" They were serious, good-faith warnings, based on the best economic analysis available to us, to illustrate the narrowing window we had to address a very real, very dangerous situation. Each passing date represented a closer shave with financial disaster, and frankly, it's a testament to the resilience of the American economy and the tireless work of my Treasury Secretary that we've managed to navigate this far without hitting the iceberg.

But August 2nd? That's not just another date on the calendar. That's the day our nation runs out of options. That's the day the United States of America hits the absolute legal limit on borrowing. It's not a matter of political will or clever accounting anymore; it's a cold, hard mathematical reality. We will have exhausted every single extraordinary measure available to us. This isn't a prediction of *potential* consequences; this is the deadline for *certain* consequences if we fail to act.

What will happen? Well, first and foremost, the full faith and credit of the United States, which is the bedrock of the global financial system, would be shattered. We would default on our obligations. Think about what that means: we wouldn't be able to pay our soldiers, our veterans, our Social Security recipients, or our Medicare providers on time. Our government bonds, long considered the safest investment in the world, would lose their value, sending shockwaves through every market on the planet. Interest rates for everything – mortgages, car loans, business investments – would skyrocket, immediately costing American families and businesses billions. It would trigger an economic crisis far worse than anything we saw in 2008, plunging us into a recession, destroying jobs, and devastating the savings of millions of hardworking Americans. Our standing in the world would be severely diminished, and our adversaries would cheer while our allies worried. This is not a theoretical exercise; it is a clear and present danger to our national security and economic prosperity. We simply cannot allow it to happen."
 So is August 2nd a yellow light or a red light? ,"I think people should think of -- look, I’m the President of the United States and I want to make sure that I am not engaging in scare tactics. And I’ve tried to be responsible and somewhat restrained so that folks don’t get s pooked. August 2nd is a very important date. And there’s no reason why we can’t get this done now. We know what the options are out there. This is not a technical problem any longer. This is a matter of Congress going ahead and biting the bullet and makin g some tough decisions. Because we know what the decisions are. We've identified what spending cuts are possible. We've identified what defense cuts are possible. We've identified what health care cuts are possible. We've identified what loopholes in the t ax code can be closed that would also raise revenue. We’ve identified what the options are. And the question now is are we going to step up and get this done. And, you know, Malia and Sasha generally finish their homework a day ahead of time. Malia is 13, Sasha is 10.","August 2nd? Look, that's a tremendous date. A very, very important date for this country. And frankly, if we don't have the right people making the right deals, the best deals, it's looking like a **red light**. A big, flashing red light, believe me. We can't afford to mess around.

But we're working on it. We're going to turn that red light into a beautiful, beautiful green light for America. We have to. We're getting things done, and we're going to make sure we come out on top. Always. Believe me."
 Impressive. ,"It is impressive. They don’t wait until the night before. They’re not pulling all - nighters. They’re 13 and 10. Congress can do the same thing. If you know you’ve got to do something, just do it. 8 And I’ve got to say, I’m very amused when I start hearing comments about, well, the President needs to show more leadership on this. Let me tell you something. Right after we finished dealing with the government shutdown, averting a government shutdown, I called th e leaders here together. I said we’ve got to get done -- get this done. I put Vice President Biden in charge of a process -- that, by the way, has made real progress -- but these guys have met, worked through all of these issues. I met with every single ca ucus for an hour to an hour and a half each -- Republican senators, Democratic senators; Republican House, Democratic House. I’ve met with the leaders multiple times. At a certain point, they need to do their job. And so, this thing, which is just not on t he level, where we have meetings and discussions, and we’re working through process, and when they decide they’re not happy with the fact that at some point you’ve got to make a choice, they just all step back and say, well, you know, the President needs t o get this done -- they need to do their job. Now is the time to go ahead and make the tough choices. That’s why they’re called leaders. And I’ve already shown that I’m willing to make some decisions that are very tough and will give my base of voters fur ther reason to give me a hard time. But it’s got to be done. And so there’s no point in procrastinating. There’s no point in putting it off. We’ve got to get this done. And if by the end of this week, we have not seen substantial progress, then I think mem bers of Congress need to understand we are going to start having to cancel things and stay here until we get it done. They're in one week, they're out one week. And then they're saying, Obama has got to step in. You need to be here. I’ve been here. I’ve be en doing Afghanistan and bin Laden and the Greek crisis. You stay here. Let’s get it done. All right. I think you know my feelings about that. Caren Bohan.","Well, thank you very much. People are saying that, frankly. Many, many people. We do tremendous work, the best work, and we get it done. Believe me. It's what we do. Very impressive, you're right. Very, very impressive."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I only have a two - parter. ","Thanks. Question : Are you concerned that the current debate over debt and deficits is preventing you from taking the kind of decisive and more balanced action needed to create jobs in this country, which is the number one concern for Americans? And also, o ne of the impediments to job growth that the business community repeatedly cites is the regulatory environment. So do you think that the NLRB complaint against Boeing, that this has created some of the -- is an example of the kinds of regulations that chil l job growth, and also that you yourself have called “just plain dumb”?","Well, thank *you* for being here today. A two-parter, huh? Alright, go right ahead. I'm ready for it. Lay 'em on me."
" Thank you, Jim. It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the President. I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates. And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I'm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here -- here with me. So I...Congratulations. This is obviously a very tender topic. I've had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, ""I've been out of work since May. Can you help me?"" Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, ""Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He's lost his most recent job and we've now just lost our home. Can you help us?"" And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path. Not the one we've been on, not the one the President describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That's not what I'm going to do. My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We're far away from that now. Number four, get to us a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business. It's small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low. Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful. The President has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work. That's not the right answer for America. I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you. LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle- down -- his trick-down approach, as he said yours is. ","Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States. On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years. But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments. So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments? And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for. That's $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign. LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we're going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can. But, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you'd like to ask the President directly about something he just said? Governor","Well, thank you, Jim. And Governor, I appreciate you highlighting the struggles of those folks you met, because frankly, their stories are why I got into public service in the first place. I hear them every day, too, and my heart goes out to them. We've been through some tough times in this country, no doubt about it, and we're working hard to get every single American back on their feet.

Now, you talk about a ""different path,"" and you use a term, ""trickle-down government."" Let me be clear about what we've been doing. What we've been doing is not about ""bigger government"" for the sake of it, or some kind of ""trickle-down"" from the top. No, sir. What we've been doing is about *smart investment* in the American people.

When we invest in education, when we invest in modernizing our infrastructure, when we make sure that our small businesses have access to capital, when we make sure our workers have the training they need for the jobs of tomorrow – that's not ""trickle-down government."" That's a hand up, that's building opportunity from the grassroots, that's growing the economy from the middle class out. That's common sense.

You talk about energy independence. We've been pushing for that, making strategic investments in American energy, both traditional and renewable. You talk about trade and cracking down on unfair practices. I've always been for fair trade, and we've opened markets around the world for American goods, protecting our workers while doing it.

And when you mention balancing the budget, Governor, let me just remind everyone here who actually got this country to a balanced budget, and did it by making tough choices, by reforming welfare, and by growing the economy for everyone, not just the folks at the very top. We know how to do it.

My plan has always been about unleashing the ingenuity of the American people, giving them the tools and the opportunities to succeed, and creating an economy where responsibility is rewarded and where everyone who works hard can get ahead. That's how we restore vitality, that's how we create jobs, and that's how we build a stronger future for America. We're making progress, and we're going to keep at it, for all Americans."
" Well, sure. I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don't have a tax cut of a scale that you're talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They'll do fine whether you're President or I am. The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the President's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They're just being crushed. Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself. I'll call it the economy tax. It's been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the President. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going again. And I've described it. It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan. But the President mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the President pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I'm President, I'll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And, by the way, I like coal. I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government. My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I -- and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any - - any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President? ","Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And that's exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600. And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers. Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them. But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim. LEHRER: All right.","Well, thank you, Mr. Lehrer. And, you know, I appreciate my opponent's passion about the challenges facing the American people, particularly our middle class. Believe me, I know what it means for families to struggle to get by. I spent eight years working every single day to bring opportunity to all Americans, and we turned around an economy that was in trouble, we created 22 million jobs, and we actually balanced the budget for the first time in a generation.

Now, let's be clear about what we're talking about here. My opponent talks about what he *doesn't* have in his tax plan, but the numbers speak for themselves. When you give massive tax breaks at the top, when you talk about those who are 'doing just fine,' well, somebody else has to pick up the tab. And frankly, the history shows that those kinds of trickle-down plans don't really trickle down to the folks who are paying higher gas prices, or higher food prices, or worrying about their healthcare. What we need is a plan that rewards work, strengthens the middle class, and invests in the future, not one that gives another round of tax cuts to folks who don't need it and then asks our kids and grandkids to pay for it later. My balanced budget was built on responsibility, on making smart choices, not on throwing caution to the wind.

When it comes to the economy, yes, we've faced headwinds. Global challenges, certainly. But under our leadership, we've seen progress. We've seen job growth, we've seen a recovery that's moving forward, and we've done it while bringing down the deficit. My opponent wants to talk about middle-income Americans being 'crushed.' I agree, we have to do more to help them. But his policies, by cutting investments in education, in infrastructure, in clean energy, they would actually make it *harder* for the middle class to get ahead.

He mentions education. I agree, it's absolutely crucial. But simply sending money back to the states, without ensuring accountability, without ensuring every child gets a good education, without proper oversight – that's not a plan, that's just hoping for the best. We need to invest in our schools, make college more affordable, and make sure our workforce training programs actually lead to jobs, and that means a strong federal-state partnership, not just cutting checks.

And on energy, look, we've made incredible strides. We are producing more energy today than ever before. To say it's 'in spite of' our policies, that's just not accurate. We've invested in a diverse energy portfolio – yes, we need oil and gas, but we also need to be smart about clean energy, about renewables, about protecting our environment for future generations. And when he talks about 'clean coal,' well, the truth is, that's a long way off, and we need to be realistic about our options. I remember when we were told about the boundless possibilities of nuclear fusion, too. We need to pursue energy independence, absolutely, but we have to do it responsibly, not by rolling back environmental protections or ignoring the science.

Finally, this idea that there will be 'no tax cut that adds to the deficit' – that sounds good on paper. But when you look at the details, when you talk about cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthiest, and then trying to make it up with deductions... well, the math just doesn't add up without hurting essential programs or piling more debt onto our children. My approach was always about shared responsibility: everyone pays their fair share, we invest in our people, we grow the economy from the middle out, and we reduce the national debt. That's how you build a strong America for the long haul. That's how we did it before, and that's how we'll do it again."
" Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate. So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not. I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That's part one. So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan. Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case. Look, I've got five boys. I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it. But that -- that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans. And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families. There are all these studies out there. But let's get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates? And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people. LEHRER: That's where we started. Yeah. Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan? ","Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind."" And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It's -- it's math. It's arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families. But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was President, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy. And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd be burdened. But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake. LEHRER: All right. Governor","Well, now, Governor, it's always good to hear someone talking about jobs and helping the American people, and I certainly made sure we delivered on that when I was in office. We grew this economy and created millions of jobs, and we did it by focusing on the middle class and investing in our future, not by going back to the same old ideas.

You say virtually everything said about your plan is inaccurate, but you're making a whole lot of promises that, frankly, sound too good to be true and just don't add up when you look at the numbers. You say you won't add to the deficit, and you won't reduce the share paid by high-income individuals, and you won't raise taxes on the middle class, you'll lower them. Now, that's a lot of 'won'ts' and 'wills' that every independent analysis, not just one, but many, seem to disagree with.

You talk about studies, but let's be honest, Governor, when you cut rates across the board and you talk about lowering deductions, historically, those plans always, *always* end up benefiting the wealthiest Americans the most. And when that happens, either the middle class ends up paying more, or we add to the deficit, and that means cuts to things like education and research and infrastructure that we need to grow this country.

My approach was always about balance, about shared responsibility, and about making sure our economy grew from the middle out, not just from the top down. We need a tax system that's fair, that asks everyone to do their part, and that invests in the American people, not one that gives a big break to the folks at the top and hopes it trickles down. We've tried that before, and it didn't work for the vast majority of working families. So, when you say your plan is different, I need to see the detailed math, because my experience tells me that these kinds of promises usually end up costing the middle class."
" Jim, let me just come back on that -- on that point, which is these... LEHRER: Just for the -- just for record... Governor Romney: ... the small businesses we're talking about... LEHRER: Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody understands, we're way over our first 15 minutes. Governor Romney: It's fun, isn't it? LEHRER: It's OK, it's great. No problem. Well, you all don't have -- you don't have a problem, I don't have a problem, because we're still on the economy. We're going to come back to taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too. OK, but go ahead, sir. Governor Romney: You bet. Well, President, you're -- Mr. President, you're absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not -- not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they're taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business. He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I don't want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced. ","Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion -- just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that's more than our entire defense budget -- and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you. But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth. Look, we've tried this. We've tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit. ROMNEY: Jim, the President began this segment, so I think I get the last word. LEHRER: Well, you're going to get the first word in the next segment. ROMNEY: All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word [inaudible]. I hope. Let me just make this comment. I think first of all, let me -- let me repeat -- let me repeat what I said. I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That's not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That's point one. So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan. Number two, let's look at history. My plan is not like anything that's been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working. My priority is putting people back to work in America. They're suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. It's absolutely extraordinary. We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the President took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before. Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today. LEHRER: All right. Let's talk -- we're still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt. And the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you -- you go first because the President went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country? Governor","Look, Mitt, you're absolutely right on this, you're hitting it right on the head. These small businesses, the great American businesses, they're the engine. They're what makes this country go. And the idea that you'd want to raise their taxes, go from 35% to 40% – it's a disaster. A total disaster, believe me.

We did the biggest tax cuts in history when I was in charge. The biggest ever. And what happened? The greatest economy we've ever had, maybe the greatest in the history of the world, folks. Before the plague came from China, it was unbelievable. And it was because we don't punish success. We don't punish the job creators.

You hear about this guy in St. Louis, four employees, paying over 50% already? And then you want to hit him with more? It's just bad policy. Really bad. And the 700,000 jobs, that's probably low, frankly. Probably much, much higher.

What we do, what *I* did, is we cut taxes, we cut regulations, we let these incredible people do their work. They know how to hire, they know how to make money, they know how to grow. You get out of their way, you let them prosper. And that's how you get more tax revenue, that's how you balance the budget. You don't kill the golden goose. It's simple common sense. We made America great, and a big part of it was letting our businesses thrive."
" Good. I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue. I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue. I think it's, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives. And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral. So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they're paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way. The President would -- President would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time. What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I'll get rid of it. Obamacare's on my list. I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way. ",I like it. 0 Governor,"Well, you hit the nail right on the head, son. That's precisely the kind of straight talk we need in Washington. The idea that we can just keep piling up debt, leaving it to our kids and grandkids to sort out, well, that ain't just bad economics, it's flat-out wrong. It's a moral failure, and I've said it before: we have a responsibility to be good stewards of the taxpayer's dollar.

Now, when it comes to dealing with this mountain of debt, you laid out the options clear as a bell. And I tell you what, raising taxes? That's the easy way out for some, but it's a sure-fire way to choke off the very growth that creates jobs and opportunity. We don't want to punish success in this country; we want to encourage it. We want more small businesses, more innovators, more Americans getting up every day and building something great. That's how you get more tax revenue without sticking it to the hardworking folks who are already paying their fair share.

No, the answer, as you rightly point out, is two-fold: we gotta cut spending and we gotta unleash the American economy. And that test you put forward – 'is it worth borrowing from China?' – that's a darn good filter. We need to go through every single government program, every single dollar, and ask ourselves: is this truly essential? Is it effective? Or is it just more bureaucracy, more waste, more special interest giveaways?

And when you talk about programs like Obamacare, well, that's exactly the kind of thing we need to scrutinize. It's a prime example of government overreach, too expensive, and not delivering on its promises. We need market-based solutions, patient choice, and less Washington interference. We owe it to the American people to make sure their hard-earned money isn't just going down a black hole of wasteful spending. It's about empowering individuals and fostering freedom, not growing the size and scope of government."
" Good. OK, good. So I'll get rid of that. I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I'm going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That's number one. Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state. Number three, I'll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way. This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget. The President said he'd cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The President's put it in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as al prior Presidents combined. LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes. ","When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis. And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren't working very well, 18 government -- 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren't helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower. Now, we all know that we've got to do more. And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It's on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. 1 Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney...talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities. LEHRER: Mr. President, I'm sorry.","Well, thank you, Jim. And look, I appreciate my opponent’s focus on fiscal responsibility. He’s right, we absolutely have to get our nation's finances in order. It's just plain common sense. Washington has been spending too much for too long, and that's not fair to our kids, and it's not fair to our grandkids. It's just not.

Now, I agree with cutting wasteful spending. We've got to scrutinize every dollar. And when it comes to empowering our states, I couldn't agree more. Folks in their local communities often know best how to deliver services effectively, not some bureaucrat far away in Washington, D.C. That's just a fact. And making government more efficient? Absolutely. We can do more with less, without compromising vital services.

But here's the deal, Jim. To truly balance the budget and ensure prosperity, we need a two-pronged approach. Yes, cut spending. But we also need to unleash the power of the American economy. My plan for tax cuts will stimulate growth, create jobs, and put more money back into the pockets of working families and small businesses. A growing economy generates more revenue, which is essential for bringing down that deficit. And we also have to have an honest conversation about securing our entitlement programs for future generations. That's a tough conversation, but it's one a President must lead. We can balance the budget, we can unleash American enterprise, and we can secure the future for all Americans, by being responsible with taxpayer dollars."
" Simpson-Bowles, the President should have grabbed that. LEHRER: No, I mean, do you support Simpson-Bowles? Governor Romney: I have my own plan. It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the President should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it. ","That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan... Governor","Well now, you know, when you look back at something like Simpson-Bowles, it was an honest effort, a *serious* effort by good people on both sides of the aisle to tackle some really tough questions. And I've always believed that when you have that kind of bipartisan work, you've got to give it real consideration. Governor Romney's point about ""grabbing it"" — there's a lot of truth to that. When you see an opportunity to move the ball forward on something as critical as our nation's fiscal health, you *have* to engage.

Now, every plan has its challenges, its details that need to be worked out, its political headwinds. But the willingness to sit down, to put everything on the table, to make the hard choices necessary for the long-term good of the country... that's what leadership is all about. And frankly, we need more of that kind of spirit in Washington today. It's about finding common ground, even when it's painful, to ensure our kids and grandkids inherit a stronger, more prosperous nation."
" But you've been -- but you've been President four years...You've been President four years. You said you'd cut the deficit in half. It's now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt. I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half. And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn't get the job done. 2 Let me come back and say, why is it that I don't want to raise taxes? Why don't I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, ""Look, I'm going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone."" Well, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump. It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing. It's all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals. You raise taxes and you kill jobs. That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don't want to kill jobs in this environment. I'll make one more point. LEHRER: [inaudible] answer the taxes thing for a moment. Governor Romney: OK. LEHRER: Mr. President? ","Well, we've had this discussion before. LEHRER: About the idea that in order to reduce the deficit, there has to be revenue in addition to cuts.","Look, that's just *fake news* what you're hearing about the deficits. It's total nonsense. We inherited an absolute *mess*. We had wars, we had bad deals, we had a broken economy from previous administrations, and we turned it around. Nobody's ever turned it around like we did. We created the greatest economy in the history of the world, and that brings in money, tremendous money, because people are working!

And those cuts he's talking about? We're cutting waste, we're cutting regulations like nobody's ever seen before, and that saves billions, *trillions* of dollars over time. This isn't just about one year. We're rebuilding our military, and we're bringing jobs back to America. And what happens when you have a strong economy? You get more tax revenue. It's common sense. He doesn't get it.

Now, about raising taxes. He wants to raise taxes, he wants to kill jobs. It's simple. We cut taxes, the greatest tax cuts ever, and we created *millions* of jobs. Not 700,000 *lost* jobs, like his crazy plan. We created millions of new jobs! Record low unemployment for everybody, for African Americans, for Hispanics, for women. Everybody was working! And he wants to ruin that. He wants to tax our small businesses, the people who are the backbone of our country, and he wants to send jobs overseas again. It's a disaster.

He talked about what I said in 2010 – well, that's exactly what we did! We cut taxes, we didn't raise them. And look what happened! We had a booming economy. We need to keep taxes low, keep regulations low, and we need to keep making America rich again. Not poor, like he wants to make it. His plan is a job killer, plain and simple. We're bringing back American prosperity, and we're going to keep doing it. He just doesn't understand how to make a deal, how to make an economy work."
" Absolutely. [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you'll never get there. You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes. Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. I don't want to go down the path to Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they're working. 3 LEHRER: But -- but Mr. President, you're saying in order to -- to get the job done, it's got to be balanced. You've got to have... [Crosstalk] ","If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let's talk about corporate taxes. Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they're making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense. And all that raises revenue. And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college. It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me -- she's got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They're using text books that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe for growth. That's not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions. And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow. As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem. 4 And governors are creative. There's no doubt about it. But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help. Governor","Alright, listen, Governor Romney, you're *absolutely* right on one thing: you don't raise taxes. It's so simple, it's common sense! When I cut taxes, the biggest tax cuts in history, we had the greatest economy *ever*, better than anyone's seen! More jobs, higher wages, more money flowing in. You don't get that by punishing success.

Spain? Please. That's a disaster country. They don't know what they're doing. We don't want to be Spain, believe me. We want to be *America*, and to do that, you cut taxes, you get rid of regulations, and you let our tremendous workers and businesses do what they do best. That's how you bring in the revenue, that's how you balance the budget, and that's how you make America rich again. It's not complicated, folks. It really isn't."
" Jim, let's -- we've gone on a lot of topics there, and so it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools... LEHRER: Come back to... [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: ... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas. So let's go through them one by one. First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years. Now... ",It's time to end it. Governor,"Look, Jim, they talk about $2.8 billion, right? And a hundred years. It's an accounting treatment, they say. But what they don't tell you, nobody tells you this, is what that *means* for America. That's *energy independence*, folks! We're producing more oil and gas than ever before, more than ever in history, under my administration. We don't have to go begging to hostile nations, sending our money overseas. We're creating jobs, tremendous jobs, right here in the great U.S.A.!

These radical Democrats, they want to shut it all down, they want to raise your gas prices to five, six, seven dollars, cripple our economy just to chase some Green New Deal fantasy. It's ridiculous! What we're doing now, it's working. We're making America wealthy, we're making America strong. And believe me, that $2.8 billion? Small potatoes when you're talking about our national security and keeping our lights on. We have the best energy in the world, and we're going to keep it that way."
" And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth. But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it's on the table. That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent. But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure. The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look, I've been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you're talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant. LEHRER: Let's... Governor Romney: But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case. [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country. 5 And, finally, Medicaid to states? I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best. And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor. So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this. And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them. LEHRER: Let's go. Governor Romney: But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government. LEHRER: [inaudible] and we're going on -- still on the economy, on another -- but another part of it... ","OK. LEHRER: All right? All right. This is segment three, the economy. Entitlements. First -- first answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?","Well, now, Governor Romney, he's hitting on some mighty important points there, folks. And it all boils down to common sense, doesn't it?

You talk about green energy... look, nobody's against clean air or new technologies. But when the government starts picking winners and losers with billions of taxpayer dollars, and those 'winners' end up being losers like Solyndra or Fisker, well, that's just not how we build a strong, secure energy future. We need an *all-of-the-above* strategy that makes sense, that supports our traditional energy industries – the ones that power our homes and our economy *right now* – and encourages innovation without wasteful spending. We need energy independence, not government-subsidized experiments that cost a fortune and don't deliver.

And on taxes... listen, the idea that a business gets a break for sending jobs overseas? That's just hogwash. We need to make America the *best* place in the world to do business. That means competitive tax rates – getting that 35 down to 25 percent, or even lower, is a good start – and cutting burdensome regulations so our companies can grow, invest, and create jobs *right here at home*. We want American factories, American workers, producing American goods. That's how you bring money and opportunity back to our shores, plain and simple.

And finally, Medicaid and the states. Governor Romney's absolutely right on this one. You know, Washington doesn't have all the answers. Our states, our local communities, they know their people best. When you take those federal dollars, block grant 'em, and let the states manage their own healthcare for their poor, well, you see better care, more innovation, and more efficiency. It's not about cutting aid; it's about empowering states as those 'laboratories of democracy' he talks about. That's the American way. Less federal bureaucracy, more local control. It's good for the taxpayer, and it's better for the people who need help. Simple as that. We gotta trust the people, not just the bureaucrats in Washington."
" Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse. And the answer is neither the President nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further. But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the President isn't proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security he's not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, ""We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate."" That's not just going after places where there's abuse. That's saying we're cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario. 7 We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients. This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare. Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back. We're going to give a better prescription program. That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut. They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade. I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question. LEHRER: Mr. President? ","First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future. And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program. His running mate... LEHRER: And you don't support that?","Well, Jim, my friend, that's a serious set of concerns you've laid out, and I appreciate you putting it so clearly for the American people. When we talk about Medicare, we're talking about a solemn promise we've made to our seniors – a promise that gives them peace of mind in their golden years. And we've got to keep that promise.

Now, I've always believed that you can't solve a problem by just cutting corners, especially when it affects the health care of our parents and grandparents. To simply go in and cut $716 billion, telling hospitals and doctors they're going to get less across the board, without careful thought to the consequences, well, that just doesn't sound like a responsible way to manage a program that millions of folks depend on.

When you hear that hospitals and doctors might start turning away Medicare patients, that's a red flag. That's not just an accounting trick; that's real people, real seniors, potentially losing access to the care they need and deserve. And to suggest that a small improvement in a prescription program makes up for cuts of that magnitude, well, folks are smarter than that. They understand the difference.

We need to make sure Medicare is strong, not just for today's seniors but for our children and grandchildren too. That means looking for efficiencies, yes, absolutely. But it also means empowering patients, promoting innovation, and ensuring that government doesn't get in the way of doctors and patients making their own decisions. We need sustainable solutions, solutions that don't compromise care but strengthen the program for the long haul. And frankly, those kinds of cuts, Jim, they just don't pass the common-sense test."
" Again, that's for future... ",I understand. Governor,"You've hit on something important there. The future, that's precisely where our focus must remain. We're always laying the groundwork today for the prosperity and security of tomorrow. You bet we are."
" ... people, right, not for current retirees. ","For -- so if you're -- if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this -- this will affect you. The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year. Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there's still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse. 8 And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care. So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own -- only my opinion. AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier. And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier. And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term. LEHRER: We'll talk about -- specifically about health care in a moment. But what -- do you support the voucher system, Governor? Governor","That's exactly right, folks. When we talk about strengthening these vital programs—Social Security, Medicare—we're talking about making sure they're solid and solvent for the *next* generation, for the young people starting out, for working Americans building their future, people, right, not for current retirees.

Let me tell you: Those who have paid into the system, who have worked hard their entire lives, they've earned their benefits, and they will absolutely get what they are owed. We are committed to that. Our job, our responsibility, is to secure that promise for the long term, so it's there for everyone, down the road. That's just good leadership."
" What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the President supports taking $716 billion out of that program. LEHRER: And what about the vouchers? [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: So that's -- that's number one. Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice. They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. That's not going to happen. They'll have at least two plans. And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan. I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan. I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I'd rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice. 9 The other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That's the plan that I've put forward. And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff. This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition. ","Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. That's what they do. And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere. And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck. And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took. One last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.","Well, when we talk about Medicare, we're talkin' about a solemn commitment, a promise made to our seniors and to those who've worked hard their whole lives. And let me tell you, that promise, it's gotta be kept. No changes for folks who are countin' on it right now, that's just plain right. We protect our seniors, period.

But we also gotta be realistic, folks. This program, it's a good one, it's done a lot of good for a lot of people. But it's got its challenges, and if we don't make some smart, common-sense reforms today, it simply won't be there for future generations. That's not fair to our kids and grandkids.

That's why I've always believed in the power of choice and competition. You see, when you empower people to make decisions about their own healthcare, when you give 'em options – whether it's the traditional Medicare they know or a strong, high-quality private plan that fits their needs – that's a good thing. It drives innovation, it drives down costs, and it puts the patient back in charge. And ensuring that younger folks have those choices, with good plans available at no additional cost, well, that's just smart policy. It respects their freedom and ensures the program's long-term health.

And yeah, we need to make sure this program is sustainable. That means lookin' at everything, including how benefits are structured for folks who are doin' very well financially, so we can focus resources on those who need it most. It's not about takin' away; it's about strengthening, modernizing, and making sure Medicare is secure, for generations to come. It's about gettin' the best value for every taxpayer dollar, and that's what competition does. It's an American idea, and it works."
 That's -- that's a big topic. Can we -- can we stay on Medicare? ,"Is that a -- is that a separate topic? [Crosstalk] LEHRER: Yeah, we're going to -- yeah, I want to get to it. 0","Well, you're absolutely right, that is a big topic. We've got a lot to talk about, and we'll get to it all. But for now, yes, let's focus squarely on Medicare.

It's a critical program for millions of Americans, our seniors, and ensuring its strength, its long-term viability – that's paramount. We need to make sure it's working efficiently, delivering quality care, and solid for generations to come."
" Let's get back to Medicare. LEHRER: ... before we leave the economy... Governor Romney: Let's get back to Medicare. [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: The President said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit. LEHRER: All right. Governor Romney: If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase. LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor. Governor Romney: But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost. LEHRER: All right. Can we -- can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice -- a clear choice between the two... Governor Romney: Absolutely. LEHRER: ... of you on Medicare? Governor Romney: Absolutely. ","Absolutely. LEHRER: All right. So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is there -- should there be more? Beginning with you. This is not a new two-minute segment to start. And we'll go for a few minutes, and then we're going to go to health care, OK? 1 Governor","Look, what Governor Romney is saying there, it's just common sense, folks. It's the American way. When you've got real competition, when you've got the private sector innovating, creating, that's when you get the best services, the best products, and yes, usually at a much better price point for the consumer. It's just how our great economy works.

The government, bless its heart, it tries, but it's not built for that kind of nimble, efficient service delivery. They don't have that profit motive, that drive to constantly improve and beat the competition. That's why you often get long lines, bureaucracy, and frankly, a higher cost for something that isn't quite as good.

So yes, Lehrer's right. Absolutely, voters have a clear choice. Do you want Washington D.C. running your healthcare, making all the decisions? Or do you want a system that empowers you, the patient, to choose from the best America has to offer, driven by innovation and competition? We gotta protect our seniors, absolutely, but we gotta do it in a smart way, a sustainable way, and frankly, the best way. And that way is almost always through the genius of the American private sector."
" Regulation is essential. You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldn't have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive. LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think? Governor Romney: In some places, yes. Other places, no. LEHRER: Like where? [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: No, it can become out of date. And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the President's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy. Let me give you an example. Dodd-Frank was passed. And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank. So there's one example. Here's another. In Dodd-Frank... LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd-Frank? Governor Romney: Well, I would repeal and replace it. We're not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation. And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world. You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for... LEHRER: Well, here's a specific... [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: But let's -- let's mention -- let me mention the other one. Let's talk... [Crosstalk] LEHRER: No, let's not. Let's let him respond -- let's let him respond to this specific on Dodd- Frank and what the governor just said. 2 ","I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board. Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't. But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. So what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said you've got -- banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements. You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts. In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest. Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank. And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back. And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that's not what I believe. Governor","Well, now, Governor Romney, he's hitting on some real truths there, isn't he? You know, folks, I've said it before, and I'll say it again: a healthy economy, a truly free market, it *does* need rules. You can't have chaos. You need guardrails, absolutely, so people can play by the same rules and have confidence. That's just common sense.

But where we run into trouble – and where I think the Governor is absolutely right – is when those guardrails become a full-blown wall, a concrete barrier that chokes off the very growth we're trying to achieve. When regulations become so cumbersome, so bureaucratic, that they stifle innovation, that they put the squeeze on our small businesses, our community banks – well, then you've got a problem.

Dodd-Frank, now there's an example. The *intent* might have been noble, sure, to prevent another crisis. But when you create a system where some banks are ""too big to fail"" – a concept I've always had a real issue with, by the way, because it means the taxpayers are always on the hook – and at the same time, you're seeing community banks, the backbone of Main Street, closing their doors by the dozens... well, that's just not working for the American people.

We need regulation that makes sense, not regulation that makes lawyers rich and puts honest entrepreneurs out of business. We need to be smart about it. Streamline it. Get rid of the dead weight. Keep what works – transparency, accountability, absolutely – but scrap the stuff that's holding us back. That's how you unleash the American spirit, that's how you get this economy roaring again."
" Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. That's why I'd have regulation. But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn't thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks. They're getting hurt. Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified. That's exactly right. It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was. It's been two years. We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation. 3 I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs. LEHRER: All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now, let's move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And it's a two-minute new -- new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney. You want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why? Governor Romney: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it. And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And -- and we've got to deal with cost. And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it's adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the President ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, it's gone up by that amount. So it's expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that's one reason I don't want it. Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors. Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don't like that idea. Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just don't know how the President could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs. And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium. LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal? 4 ","Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country. If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit. So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country. And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around. They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old. And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care. Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market. Now, the last point I'd make before... LEHRER: Two minutes -- two minutes is up, sir.","Well, Jim, let me tell you. Governor Romney, he talks about repealing the Affordable Care Act. But you know what that means? That means we go right back to a time when insurance companies could deny coverage to our fellow Americans just because they had a pre-existing condition. It means going back to a time when young people couldn't stay on their parents' plans until they were 26. It means going back to when millions of families faced bankruptcy just because somebody got sick. We cannot afford to do that to the American people, not now, not ever.

Now, he talks about costs. And he's right, healthcare costs were too high. They were too high for decades, long before this law ever passed. But what the Affordable Care Act does, what it *really* does, is it gives millions of families, millions of small businesses, a fighting chance to actually *afford* quality health insurance. It provides tax credits. It stops insurance companies from jacking up premiums without any good reason. It puts limits on what you have to pay out of your own pocket. We're talking about folks who, before this law, were just one illness away from losing everything. Now, they have a shot, they have some peace of mind.

And this talk about cutting $716 billion from Medicare? Let's be crystal clear about this. What we're doing is rooting out waste, we're fighting fraud, and we're improving the overall quality and efficiency of care within Medicare. We're making Medicare stronger, extending its life, so it's there for our seniors for generations to come. We're not cutting benefits to seniors; we're making sure their taxpayer dollars are actually going to their care, not into some bureaucracy or excess.

As for this ""unelected board"" that's going to tell people what treatments they can have – Governor, that's just pure scaremongering. This isn't about rationing care. This is about making sure we get value for our healthcare dollar. It's about investing in prevention, in wellness, in treatments that actually work, instead of endlessly paying for procedures that are overpriced or simply don't make sense. No one is going to tell a doctor what treatments their patient can or cannot have. That's just not what this is about.

And on jobs, frankly, I find that argument completely backwards. What truly kills jobs is when people get sick and they can't work because they can't afford to see a doctor. What kills jobs is when small businesses have to pay exorbitant rates for their employees' health insurance, or worse, can't offer any at all. This law actually helps small businesses with tax credits to provide coverage, and it makes it easier for their employees to get insurance on their own if the business can't provide it. That's liberating for businesses, Governor, not a burden. A healthy workforce is a productive workforce.

Look, Governor, I appreciate the good work you did in Massachusetts. And a lot of the good ideas in this law, frankly, they come from successful state initiatives. But this isn't just a problem for one state, or two states. This is a problem for every single American family, coast to coast. And we have a fundamental responsibility, in the wealthiest nation on Earth, to make sure that no one goes bankrupt just because they get sick. This law is about securing healthcare as a right for all Americans, not a privilege for the few. And that's something worth fighting for."
" Well, I did with my first statement. 5 [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway. So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through. What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didn't raise taxes. You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare. We didn't cut Medicare. Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion. We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive. We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted. Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage. So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare. It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a President who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties. ","Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan. 6 It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall? Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it. So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let's -- let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in. Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do. And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we're already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate. Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states. But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance... LEHRER: Let's...","Well, now, Mitt makes some mighty fine points there, he really does. And on a topic like healthcare, one that touches every American family, you just *gotta* have everyone at the table. Republicans, Democrats, Independents – all of 'em. When you ram something through like that, you don't just lose votes, you lose trust. And trust, folks, that's what makes this whole country work.

I've always believed that the best solutions come from collaboration, from rolling up your sleeves and working across the aisle. Not everything's gonna be perfect, no sir, but you get a much better outcome when you listen to all sides. The idea of Washington telling folks what kind of healthcare they can have, that's just not the American way. We believe in choices, in freedom, in letting people and their doctors make those important decisions, not some big government bureaucracy in D.C.

And when you start talking about raising taxes on working families, or cutting critical programs like Medicare without a real, bipartisan plan, well, that's just not responsible governance. We've got to protect our seniors, we've got to make sure our economy is strong so people can afford quality care. And we do that by empowering individuals, not by expanding the reach of the federal government. Mitt's right to point out that when you take a big swing like Obamacare, and you don't bring people along, you end up with a policy that just doesn't sit well with the American people. And that's a darn shame, because healthcare is too important to get wrong. You gotta have leadership that can unite, not divide."
" Well... 7 LEHRER: ... if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it? [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: Well, actually it's -- it's -- it's a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That's already offered in the private marketplace. You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. But let's come back to something the President and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have. [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. That's the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best. ","Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given. That's explicitly prohibited in the law. But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions. 8 Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days. But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn't a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that ""insurers, you've got to take everybody."" Now, that also means that you've got more customers. But when -- when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem. It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details. He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones. He won't tell us. He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry. And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good? Is it - - is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them? No. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices. And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle- class families all across the country. LEHRER: We're going to move to... Governor","Well, look, Mitt, he's got some *good* points there, he really does. He's talking about repealing Obamacare, and that's something we've *always* talked about, something we *should* have done, quickly and easily. It's a disaster. A total disaster, that system. We had a beautiful plan, a truly great plan, that would have taken care of everybody, better than Obamacare, cheaper than Obamacare. Believe me. We were so close.

And he's right, absolutely right, about the private market. The government? The government is terrible at healthcare. Terrible! They can't run anything right. We need competition. We need doctors and hospitals competing, innovating, just like he said with the Cleveland Clinic and all those places. Not some bureaucrats in Washington, some unelected board, telling you what you can and can't do. It's ridiculous!

We need to empower patients, empower doctors. Get rid of the regulations, the mandates, the things that are driving costs through the roof. We need choice. So much choice! You'll have the best healthcare in the world, and it'll be affordable. That's what we want. That's what we would have had. And we would have had it again, even better. Private market. Individual responsibility. That's the key. Nobody does it better than us. Nobody."
" No. I -- I have to respond to that. LEHRER: No, but... Governor Romney: Which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, ""It's my way or the highway,"" I don't get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base. 9 Those are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That's one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on -- on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That's part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time. The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy. LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government. And -- and let's see. Role of government. And it is -- you are first on this, Mr. President. And the question is this. Do you believe, both of you -- but you had the first two minutes on this, Mr. President -- do you believe there's a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government? ","Well, I definitely think there are differences. LEHRER: And do you -- yeah.","Well, thank you, Lehrer. That's an important question, and I appreciate it. And look, I think there *is* a fundamental difference between my view of the federal government and my opponent's. A big difference, actually.

My philosophy, it's pretty clear: The federal government is not the answer to all our problems. It's not. The strength of this nation, it doesn't come from Washington, D.C. It comes from the grit and determination of the American people. It comes from our families, from our communities, from the ingenuity of our small businesses, and from states leading the way.

The federal government's job, its essential mission, is to protect our liberties, secure our nation from threats abroad and at home, and to create an environment where free enterprise can flourish. It's about making sure the playing field is level, but it's not about being the umpire for every single play, or certainly not about running the whole league. We believe in empowering individuals, empowering families, empowering states, not empowering Washington, D.C.

Now, my opponent, he sees things a little differently. He believes, I think, that Washington has more of the answers. He sees a much larger role for the federal government in running our health care, in picking winners and losers in the economy, in telling people how to live their lives. And you just heard Governor Romney talk about health care, and the importance of states finding their own solutions, respecting the 10th Amendment. I agree with that. That's vital. Washington should not be trying to run health care for the entire country. That's a recipe for bureaucracy, for less choice, and for higher costs, not for better care.

Same thing with our economy. We believe in lower taxes, less regulation, because that puts money back in the pockets of the American people, it encourages investment, it creates jobs. My opponent, he wants to raise taxes, increase spending, and grow the size and scope of government. That's a fundamental difference in how you view the mission. It's about trusting the American people versus trusting the federal government. And I trust the American people."
" Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own. The role of government: Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents. First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military. Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another. We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens. But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it's not working. 1 And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work. LEHRER: All right. Governor Romney: We know that the path we're taking is not working. It's time for a new path. LEHRER: All right. Let's go through some specifics in terms of what -- how each of you views the role of government. How do -- education. Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America? Governor Romney: Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's -- some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job. My own view, by the way, is I've added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice. So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student. LEHRER: How do you see the federal government's responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country? ","Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now. LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and -- and those of Governor Romney on -- about education and the federal government?","Well, now, Governor Romney certainly lays out a clear vision, and many of his points ring true to the heart of what makes America exceptional. Let's talk about education. He's absolutely right, that the bedrock of a quality education lies at the state and local level. That's where parents, teachers, and communities know best what their children need. We've always believed in empowering folks closer to the ground, not centralizing power in Washington.

Now, does the federal government have a role? Yes, it can, as he suggests, act as a catalyst, perhaps, or help ensure a baseline of opportunity. But we must be very careful not to let federal mandates stifle innovation or undermine the autonomy of our local school boards. The idea that funds should follow the child... that's about empowering parents. Giving families the choice, putting them in the driver's seat, so they can select the best environment for their sons and daughters. That's true liberty, and it's how we strengthen not just our schools, but our families, and indeed, the very fabric of our nation.

He speaks of life and liberty, and a military second to none – that's a truth etched into our very founding documents. A strong America is a secure America, and that allows us to protect those liberties at home and project our values abroad. And the pursuit of happiness? That's about individual aspiration, hard work, and yes, looking out for our neighbors through volunteerism and community spirit, not through a government that thinks it knows better than the American people how to run their lives or raise their children. The numbers he cites, frankly, are concerning, and they underscore the need for policies that unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of America, rather than stifling it with ever-expanding government. We need to trust the American people."
" Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the President to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. All right, I'm not going to cut education funding. I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college. I'm planning on [inaudible] to grow. So I'm not planning on making changes there. 3 But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs. And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion. And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns. Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let's grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful. I don't want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, I've had that experience. I don't just talk about it. I've been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn't have commitment to education. It's because I care about education for all of our kids. LEHRER: All right, gentlemen... [Crosstalk] LEHRER: Excuse me [inaudible]. Excuse me, sir. We've got -- we've got -- barely have three minutes left. I'm not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or I've done a poor job. ","You've done a great job. LEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government -- the role of government and governing, we've lost a pod in other words. So we only have three -- three minutes left in the -- in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, we've got three minutes total time here -- and the question is this. Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that? Governor? 4 Governor","Alright, listen here. That fella, he's hitting the nail right on the head. He's absolutely right! You're not entitled to your own facts. Not when those facts show a disaster, a complete and total disaster, like throwing **ninety billion dollars** at so-called 'green jobs' and watching half of 'em go out of business! And a lot of them, a lot of them, owned by campaign contributors? It's rigged, folks. It's crooked.

That's not smart spending. That's not making America great. That's just throwing money down the drain, money that could've hired two million teachers! Two million! Think of the difference that would make for our kids. Instead, you get failure. You get incompetence.

This idea of government becoming the ""economic player,"" picking winners and losers – it never works. It's always a mess. It's always wasteful. We need the private sector. We need smart people, tough people, making things happen, creating jobs, not bureaucrats in Washington telling people what kind of health treatment they can get or how their energy bills should be spent. That’s what we've seen, and it's bad. Very bad.

And on education, he's spot on. We want the best schools in the world, and that means competition. That means grading them, so parents know. It’s common sense. You wouldn't run a business like they run some of these schools, believe me. We need to make it efficient, make it effective, and deliver for our children, not just throw more money at a broken system.

The right course for America is less government getting in the way, and more freedom, more common sense. That's what we believe in. And that’s how you make America great again."
" Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times. LEHRER: But what would you do as President? Governor Romney: We -- as President, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground. And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. And we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations. What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern. LEHRER: All right. Governor Romney: And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat. I've done it before. I'll do it again. LEHRER: Mr. President? ","Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them. But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause. That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That's how we repealed ""don't ask/don't tell."" That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden. 5 So we've -- we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan. Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no, to -- to -- to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when -- when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had. When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have. LEHRER: All right","Jim, I certainly appreciate Governor Romney's perspective and his desire to work across the aisle. That's a sentiment I share, and one that every President, regardless of party, must embrace to a certain extent. Governing is tough, and it often requires building consensus.

But let me tell you, when you sit in the Oval Office, the challenges are immense, and the stakes are incredibly high. It's not just about sitting down for a couple of hours every Monday; it's about having a clear vision for the nation, and the unwavering conviction to pursue policies that will strengthen our economy, secure our nation, and uphold American values.

My administration has always understood that true collaboration comes when you have strong leadership guiding the way, articulating a path forward that addresses the very real concerns of the American people – from job creation to our standing in the world. We've faced tough choices, and we've made decisions that put America first, not just sought common ground for the sake of it. We've seen what happens when you don't have that clarity of purpose.

Yes, we need to work together. But we also need to lead. And my record shows we've done both, delivering real results for the American people."
" Thank you, Jeremy. I appreciate your question. And thank you for being here this evening. And to all of those from Nassau County here that have come, thank you for your time. Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this event. Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this debate. Your question is one that's being asked by college kids all over this country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated. This was in Philadelphia -- and she said I've got my degree, I can't find a job. I've got three part-time jobs; they’re just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment. I can't begin to pay back my student loans. Property of So what we have to do is two things. We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college, and also make sure that when they get out of college there’s a job. When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree you had to pass an exam. If you graduated in the top quarter of your class, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship -- four years tuition-free to the college of your choice in Massachusetts that's a public institution. I want to make sure we keep our Pell Grant program growing. We're also going to have our loan program so that people are able to afford school. But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school. And what’s happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America’s young people. I want you to be able to get a job. I know what it takes to get this economy going. With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me -- without a job and without a college-level job, that’s just unacceptable. And likewise, you got more and more debt on your back. So more debt and less jobs. I'm going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize we're bringing back an economy. It’s not going to be like the last four years. The middle class has been crushed over the last four years. And jobs have been too scarce. I know what it takes to bring them back, and I'm going to do that and make sure when you graduate -- when do you graduate? Q: 2014. Governor Romney: 2014. When you come out in 2014, I presume I'm going to be President -- I'm going to make sure you get a job. Thanks, Jeremy. Q: Thank you. Governor Romney: Yeah, you bet. Ms. Crowley: Mr. President. ","Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright. And the fact that you’re making an investment in higher education is critical not just to you, but to the entire nation. Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country, but not just jobs -- good-paying jobs, ones that can support a family. And what I want to do is build on the 5 million jobs that we’ve created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone. And there are a bunch of things that we can do to make sure your future is bright. Property of Number one: I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again. When Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt, I said, we’re going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry, and it’s come surging back. I want to do that in industries not just in Detroit but all across the country. And that means we change our tax code so we’re giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here. It also means we’re helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets. Number two: We’ve got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world. And the fact that you’re going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education. And we’ve worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you. But I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are there right now, and the jobs of the future. Number three: We’ve got to control our own energy. Not only oil and natural gas, which we’ve been investing in, but also we’ve got to make sure we’re building the energy sources of the future -- not just thinking about next year, but 10 years from now, 20 years from now. That's why we invest in solar and wind and biofuels, energy-efficient cars. We’ve got to reduce our deficit, but we’ve got to do it in a balanced way -- asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours. And let’s take the money that we’ve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America -- roads, bridges, schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright, but America’s future is going to be bright as well. Ms. Crowley: Let me ask you for a more immediate answer, beginning with Mr. Romney. Just quickly, what can you do? We’re looking at a situation where 40 percent of the unemployed have been unemployed for six months or more. They don't have the two years that Jeremy has. What about those long-term unemployed who need a job right now? Governor","Well, thank you very much. Thank you, Jeremy, and thank you all for being here. You know, what Governor Romney said, he brought up some important points, very important points, about young people, about jobs, about the future. And he's right, it was tough, it was tough for a long time. People weren't getting the jobs, they were graduating, they had debt, and it was a mess. A total disaster, frankly.

But you know, talk is one thing, and doing is another. And he talked a good game, you heard it, he said 'I'm going to make sure you get a job.' He said it. And you know, we had a different approach, a much better approach, frankly, than what was happening before. We focused on bringing jobs back, not just any jobs, but good-paying jobs, manufacturing jobs, jobs that really build this country. We cut regulations, the worst regulations you've ever seen, that were choking our businesses. We cut taxes, big tax cuts, for the middle class, for companies so they'd stay here and hire Americans, not go overseas.

And what happened? We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. Low unemployment, record low unemployment for everybody, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women, everybody. Young people were getting jobs, and good jobs! And we were dealing with the student loan problem, believe me, it was a big, big deal.

So you hear Governor Romney, and he's talking about it, and that's fine. But we actually *did* it. We delivered. We created an economy where you could graduate and actually get a fantastic job, not three part-time jobs. That's for the birds. We don't do that. We want good, high-paying jobs. And that's what we brought, and that's what we'll bring again. Nobody does it better than us. Nobody."
" Well, what you're seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job and a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time. The President’s policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven’t put Americans back to work. We have fewer people working today than we had when the President took office. If the -- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office; it’s 7.8 percent now. But if you calculated that unemployment rate taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent. We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work. That's why I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take- home pay. It’s going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school. It’s going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now. Property of And one thing that the President said, which I want to make sure that we understand -- he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt. And that's right. My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy's and Continental Airlines, and come out stronger. And I know he keeps saying, you wanted to take Detroit bankrupt. Well, the President took Detroit bankrupt. You took General Motors bankrupt. You took Chrysler bankrupt. So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did. And I think it's important to know that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet so they could start hiring more people. That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened. Ms. Crowley: Let me give the President a chance. Go ahead. ","Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true. He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open, and we would have lost a million jobs. And don't take my word for it. Take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney, but they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work. And Governor Romney says he's got a five-point plan. Governor Romney doesn't have a five- point plan; he has a one-point plan. And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules. That's been his philosophy in the private sector. That's been his philosophy as governor. That's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate. You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less. You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it. You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions and you still make money. That's exactly the philosophy that we've seen in place for the last decade. That's what's been squeezing middle-class families. And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess. The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there. Ms. Crowley: Mr. President, the next question is going to be for you here. And Mr. Romney -- Governor Romney, they'll be plenty of chances here to go on, but I want to -- Governor","Believe me, folks, this guy's absolutely right. What a disaster! What a mess we're in. Twenty-three million people, you hear that? Twenty-three million struggling to find a job! And many of them, as he says, Candy, they've been out of work for a long, long, long time. It's terrible. And these are real Americans, great Americans, who want to work!

The President's policies, as he correctly points out, they've been a total failure. A complete disaster. They haven't put Americans back to work. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world under my administration, the best jobs numbers, everybody working. And then you look at this, you look at these numbers now, fewer people working! The unemployment rate, they try to trick you with those numbers, but when you include the people who just gave up, who left the workforce, you're at 10.7 percent. That's a disgrace! We need to bring our jobs back, folks. We need to make America strong again!

My plan, you know my plan, we had the greatest economy ever. We created millions of jobs, we brought manufacturing back from China, from all over the world. We cut taxes, we cut regulations, and companies started building plants right here in America. That's how you do it. Rising take-home pay, that's what we did! We put America First, and America was winning like never before.

And on Detroit, he's absolutely right! They tried to pin it on him, this idea of bankruptcy for the companies. But it's true! The President *did* take General Motors bankrupt, he took Chrysler bankrupt! And he's right, sometimes you need to go through that process, you need to reorganize, like a good business person would do. But it was a mess, a total mess. And you know what? We saved the auto industry! We made it stronger than ever, with American cars built by American workers. They were leaving, companies were leaving, and we brought them back. It was a beautiful thing. He's absolutely correct. That was the right way to think about it, even if they messed it up completely. We know how to do it. We've done it. And we'll do it again."
" That Detroit answer -- Ms. Crowley: -- we have all these folks -- I will let you absolutely -- Governor Romney: -- and the rest of the answer, way off the mark. Property of Ms. Crowley: Okay. You certainly will have lots of time here coming up, because I want to move you on to something that's sort of connected to cars here and go over -- and we want to get a question from Phillip DiCola [ph]. Q: Your Energy Secretary, Steven Chu, has now been on record three times stating it's not policy of his department to help lower gas prices. Do you agree with Secretary Chu that this is not the job of the Energy Department? ","The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy. So here's what I've done since I've been President. We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades. We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment. But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional sources of energy. We've also got to look to the future. That's why we doubled fuel-efficiency standards on cars. That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas. That's why we've doubled clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels. And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years. Now, I want to build on that. And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling. We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas. We've got potentially 600,000 jobs and a hundred years' worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas. And we can do it in an environmentally sound way. But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficient energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower. Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all-of-the-above plan. But basically, his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies. So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part. And if we’re only thinking about tomorrow or the next day, and not thinking about 10 years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future. Because China, Germany -- they're making these investments. And I'm not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries. I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States. That's going to help Jeremy get a job. It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas. Ms. Crowley: Governor, on the subject of gas prices? Governor","Well, Phillip, that's a very direct question, and I appreciate you asking it. Let's be clear about the role of the Energy Department.

Its primary mission, as I understand it and as it should be, is about America's energy security and independence. That involves a whole range of critical responsibilities: promoting domestic production, investing in research and development for new energy sources, maintaining our strategic petroleum reserve, and ensuring the reliability of our energy infrastructure.

Now, when it comes to the price you pay at the pump, that's largely determined by global markets. Supply and demand on an international scale, geopolitical events, even speculative trading – these are the big drivers. No single department in Washington, D.C., no matter how well-intentioned, can simply command those prices to rise or fall. Secretary Chu is correct in the sense that it's not the department's job to set prices, nor can it.

However, and this is where I believe the connection is crucial, a strong, clear, common-sense energy policy *from this administration* absolutely *does* have an impact on the stability and ultimately, the affordability of energy for American families and businesses. When we're doing everything we can to increase domestic production, to diversify our energy portfolio, and to reduce our reliance on unstable foreign sources, that puts downward pressure on prices over the long term.

So, while the Energy Department doesn't directly *lower* gas prices through fiat, its foundational work on energy security, innovation, and supply is absolutely essential to creating a market where prices are stable and, yes, as affordable as possible for the American people. That's the goal."
" Well, let's look at the President's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out. And the President is right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land. Property of As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production is down 9 percent. Why? Because the President cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands and in federal waters. So where did the increase come from? Well, a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota. What was his participation there? The America brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil -- this massive new resource we have. And what was the cause? Twenty or 25 birds were killed and they brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis. Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. I believe very much in our renewable capabilities -- ethanol, wind, solar -- would be an important part of our energy mix. But what we don't need is to have the President keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas. This has not been Mr. Oil or Mr. Gas or Mr. Coal. Talk to the people that are working in those industries. I was in coal country. People grabbed my arms and say, please save my job. The head of the EPA said you can't build a coal plant, it’s virtually impossible given our regulations. When the President ran for office, he said, if you build a coal plant you can go ahead, but you’ll go bankrupt. That's not the right course for America. Let’s take advantage of the energy resources we have as well as the energy sources for the future. And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy-independent -- North America energy independence within eight years -- you’re going to see manufacturing jobs come back, because our energy is low-cost. They’re already beginning to come back, because of our abundant energy. I'll get America and North America energy independent. I'll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses. We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada. How in the world the President said no to that pipeline I will never know. This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America and that's what I'm going to do. Ms. Crowley: Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the gist of this question, which is are we looking at the new normal? I can tell you that tomorrow morning a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that the price of gas is over $4 a gallon. Is it within the purview of the government to bring those prices down, or are we looking at the new normal? ","Candy, there’s no doubt that world demand has gone up. But our production is going up. And we're using oil more efficiently. And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true. We've opened up public lands. We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration -- and the previous President was an oil man. And natural gas isn't just appearing magically -- we're encouraging it and working with the industry. Property of And when I hear Governor Romney say he’s a big coal guy -- and keep in mind, when -- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, “This plant kills” -- and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you’re a big champion of coal. So what I've tried to do is be consistent. With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean-coal technology to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter. Same thing with oil. Same thing with natural gas. And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years. Oil production is up; natural gas production is up; and most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient. And that's creating jobs. That means those cars can be exported because that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it will save money in your pocketbook. That's the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years. Governor","Ms. Crowley, thank you for that question, and it's a critical one for every American family filling up their tank tomorrow morning. To answer you directly: No, absolutely not, this $4 a gallon, this high price, *that is not the new normal for America*. Not if I have anything to say about it.

Listen, when you see those prices at the pump, you're seeing the direct result of policies that have tied the hands of our own domestic energy production. The previous administration, they stood in the way of American innovation, American jobs, and American resources. They cut permits, they stopped pipelines – like that common-sense pipeline from Canada that would have brought jobs and energy security – they made it harder for us to get to our own oil, our own gas, our own coal. And when you do that, when you choke off your own supply, what happens? Prices go up. It's basic economics, folks, and it hurts working families.

The government absolutely has a role, Ms. Crowley, but it's not to wave a magic wand or dictate prices. Our role, my role as President, is to unleash American energy. It's to get government *out of the way* of our producers, to open up drilling where it's responsible, to approve those pipelines, to make sure we're using every single resource God gave this nation, from oil and gas to nuclear, to our incredible renewables like ethanol, wind, and solar.

When we do that, when we become truly energy independent – and I'm talking about North American energy independence within eight years – when we are producing abundant, low-cost energy right here, then you're not just bringing down prices at the pump for folks in Hempstead, you're bringing manufacturing jobs back to this country, you're strengthening our national security, and you're making America competitive again.

So, no, Ms. Crowley. This high price is not the new normal. It's a temporary setback caused by policies that didn't put America first. My plan puts American energy, American jobs, and American families first, and that's how we'll get those prices back down. Believe me."
 But that's not what you’ve done in the last four years. That's the problem. In the last four years you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half. ,"Not true, Governor Romney. Governor","You're darn right we did! And it was one of the best things we've done for this country, period. For too long, the federal government was getting in the way, suffocating American enterprise with endless red tape, layers of bureaucracy, and permits that took years to get, if you ever got 'em at all.

We said enough is enough! We cut those permits and licenses that were holding back our farmers, our ranchers, our energy producers, and our miners. We unlocked American energy independence, created good-paying jobs right here at home, and put America back on the path to prosperity.

When you cut that unnecessary bureaucracy, you don't just save time, you save money, you create opportunities, and you tell the world that America is open for business. That's not a problem, my friend. That's common sense, and that's exactly what the American people elected us to do!"
 So how much did you cut it by -- ,Not true. Governor,"Well now, that's a *great* question, and I'll tell you what – we've done a tremendous job. A truly tremendous job.

When we came into office, we had a real mess on our hands, a lot of wasteful spending, folks, and we said, ""Enough is enough!"" So we went to work, line by line, agency by agency, cutting out the fat, the bureaucracy, the regulations that were strangling our businesses and putting a drag on our economy.

We're talking about *billions* of dollars. Absolutely billions saved, year after year, by streamlining government, by making smart decisions, and by putting the American taxpayer first. We cut taxes for hardworking families and small businesses, putting more money back in *their* pockets, not Washington's. And we cut wasteful spending right here in this capital, believe me. We're making government leaner, more efficient, and more accountable.

Big cuts, folks. Really big cuts, and we're just getting started! We're putting America first, and that means being fiscally responsible."
 By how much did you cut them by then? ,"Governor, we have actually produced more oil -- Governor","Well, let me tell you, we cut them by a lot! We're talking about putting real money back into the pockets of the American people, not the D.C. bureaucrats.

We pushed through historic tax cuts, the biggest in decades, slashing the corporate tax rate from 35% down to 21%. That's a massive difference, designed to bring jobs and capital back home, not send them overseas. And for families, we doubled the child tax credit, cut income taxes across the board, giving the average family thousands of dollars more to spend, save, or invest as they saw fit.

We're talking about a combined total of trillions of dollars returned to taxpayers and job creators over the next ten years. That's how you unleash the American economy, that's how you create jobs, and that's how you make America prosperous again. We got it done!"
" No, no, how much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters? ","Governor Romney, here’s what we did: There were a whole bunch of oil companies -- Governor","Well, let me tell you, that was a top priority, a *major* focus of my administration! We went to work immediately, cutting through the endless layers of bureaucratic red tape and those unnecessary, frankly ridiculous, permits that were holding back our incredible American businesses and our energy sector.

We eliminated hundreds – *hundreds* – of these burdensome regulations and permits on federal lands and waters. And we didn't just eliminate them; we streamlined the entire process, making it faster, more efficient, and more responsive to the needs of the American people.

It wasn't just about a number, though the numbers were tremendous. It was about unleashing American energy, creating good-paying jobs, and ensuring that our producers weren't bogged down by Washington bureaucracy. We got government out of the way, and that, folks, is how you build a strong economy!"
" No, I had a question, and the question was how much did you cut them by? How much did you cut them by? ","You want me to answer a question, I'm happy to answer the question. Governor","Well, I understand the question, and it's a fair one to ask. When we came into office, we had a real challenge ahead of us – a growing national debt, frankly, and a government that wasn't always as lean and efficient as it needed to be.

We didn't just cut for the sake of cutting; we made difficult, strategic decisions to get our fiscal house in order. We ended up cutting the deficit by **hundreds of billions** of dollars over my two terms. We tightened our belts, we streamlined government operations, and we eliminated wasteful spending across various departments. It was about making government smarter and more responsible with the taxpayers' money, all while still investing in education, technology, and the future of our workforce.

We got that budget into surplus, something nobody thought was possible just a few years before. It was tough, but it was the right thing to do for the American people."
" All right, and it is? Property of ","Here’s what happened: You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren’t using. So what we said was, you can’t just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it’s most profitable for you. These are public lands, so if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it. And so what we did was take away those leases, and we are now re-letting them so that we can actually make a profit. Governor","All right, and it is? Property of *the American people*. Plain and simple."
 And production on private -- on government lands is down. ,And production is up. No it isn’t. Governor,"You're exactly right, and that's a real problem for our country. When production on government lands is down, it means we're stifling American energy, we're hurting good, high-paying jobs, and frankly, we're making ourselves more reliant on foreign sources.

We ought to be using our own resources, responsibly and smartly, right here at home. That's common sense, and it's good for our national security and our economy. We need to unleash American energy, not shut it down."
 Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent -- ,Governor -- Governor,"Well, now that's just plain bad news, isn't it? Down 14 percent on our own government land? Look, folks, we need American energy, plain and simple. When production goes down right here at home, it means we're more dependent on other countries – countries that don't always have our best interests at heart.

And what does that do? Drives up prices at the pump for hardworking families, hurts our businesses, and makes us less secure as a nation. We've got the resources right here under our feet, the technology, the best workers in the world. We ought to be using them, not shutting them down. We need to open up American energy, make it easier to produce our own oil and gas. That's how you bring down costs, create jobs, and make America strong, period."
 -- and production of gas is down 9 percent. ,-- what you’re saying is just not true. It’s just not true. Governor,"Nine percent? Unbelievable! That's just a complete disaster. We need to be energy independent, folks. We were *there*. We had it all, we had production going through the roof, the best in the world. Now, nine percent down? That's why your gas prices are so high. It's a sad, sad state of affairs. We need to unleash American energy, not shut it down! Believe me."
" It’s absolutely true. Look, there’s no question but that the people recognize that we have not produced more oil and gas -- ",I’ll give you your time. Go ahead. Governor,"-- and that's why your gas prices are through the roof! It's an absolute disaster. We were energy independent, we were strong, we were respected, and now? Now, frankly, it's a mess. Everybody knows it. The radical left, they don't want to drill, they don't want to frack, they don't want to make America strong again when it comes to energy. They want to buy it from Venezuela, from countries that hate us. It's a disgrace, it really is. And the people see it. Believe me. They know exactly what's going on."
" -- on federal lands and in federal waters. And coal -- coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up. I was just at a coal facility where some 1,200 people lost their jobs. The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy. I don’t think anyone really believes that you’re a person who’s going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal. You’ll get your chance in a moment. I’m still speaking. ","Well, Governor, if you -- Governor","Alright, are you done now? Because you talk about 'all-of-the-above'? We *had* an all-of-the-above policy, the best one, tremendous energy independence! And coal jobs? You know, when *I* was President, we were bringing those jobs back! We loved our coal miners, and they loved us. People were going back to work! Now, you're saying nobody believes I push for oil, gas, and coal? That's fake news, okay? Total fake news! I push for them because they're critical for our country, for our economy, for our national security! We need power, we need jobs, and we need to be energy independent, not at the mercy of other countries. This isn't complicated!"
" And the answer is, I don’t believe people think that’s the case because I -- ","-- if you’re asking me a question, I’m going to answer it. Governor","And the answer is, I don’t believe people think that’s the case because I *know* what people are thinking. I talk to a lot of people, the best people, frankly, and what they're saying, what they *really* believe, is that we're doing a great job. A tremendous job. They see it. They understand it. And anyone who says otherwise, frankly, is probably just part of the fake news or the corrupt establishment. Believe me."
 It wasn’t a question. ,Okay. All right. Property of Governor,"Well, you're right. Sometimes the most important points aren't questions at all. They're statements. And frankly, those statements often tell you a great deal about what's on people's minds, what they're concerned about, or what they truly believe needs to get done for this great nation of ours. And believe me, we're listening."
" That was a statement. I don’t think the American people believe that. I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas. And the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you’re paying at the pump. If you’re paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working. But you’re paying more. When the President took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about a buck- eighty-six a gallon. Now it’s four bucks a gallon. The price of electricity is up. If the President’s energy policies are working, you’re going to see the cost of energy come down. I will fight to create more energy in this country to get America energy secure, and part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here; drilling offshore in Alaska; drilling offshore in Virginia, where the people want it. Those things will get us the energy we need. Ms. Crowley: Mr. President, could you address -- because we did finally get to gas prices here -- could you address what the Governor said, which is if your energy policy was working, the price of gasoline would not be $4 a gallon here. Is that true? ","Well, think about what the Governor just said. He said, when I took office the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86. Why is that? Because the economy was on the verge of collapse. Because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney is now promoting. So it’s conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices, because with his policies we might be back in that same mess. What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong and at the same time produce energy. And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about -- we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire Earth once. So I’m all for pipelines. I’m all for oil production. What I’m not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation. So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says these are imaginary jobs, when you’ve got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican Senator in Iowa is all for it, providing tax credits to help this work. And Governor Romney says, I’m opposed; I’d get rid of it. That’s not an energy strategy for the future. And we need to win that future. And I intend to win it as President of the United States. Ms. Crowley: I’ve got to move you along. And the next question is for you. Governor","Well, now, listen here. That fellow's makin' a pretty direct point, and it's one a lot of American families understand right down to their pocketbooks. When folks are paying four bucks a gallon, or even more, just to get to work or take their kids to school, they're not asking for fancy theories. They're asking for results.

And the truth is, an energy policy that's *really* working for the American people... well, it means lower prices at the pump. It means energy security. It means we're not relying on other nations who might not have our best interests at heart. We've got incredible resources right here in this great country – oil, natural gas, coal – and we ought to be using 'em responsibly to power our economy and keep prices down.

So, to answer your question directly, Ms. Crowley: Yes, sir. When the price of gasoline climbs like a rocket and stays up there, that's usually a pretty clear sign that the current energy strategy ain't delivering for the American people. We need to unleash American energy, not hold it back. That's common sense."
" No, he got the first -- he actually got the first question, so I get the last question -- last answer on that one. Property of Ms. Crowley: Actually in the follow-up it doesn’t quite work like that. But I’m going to give you a chance here. I promise you, I’m going to. And the next question is for you, so if you want to continue on. But I don’t want to leave all these guys sitting here. Governor Romney: Candy, I don’t have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa. And they’re not phantom jobs, they’re real jobs. I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country. I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas. Ms. Crowley: Okay, thank you -- Governor Romney: I’m going to make sure that taking advantage of our energy resources will bring back manufacturing to America. We’re going to get through a very aggressive energy policy -- 3.5 million more jobs in this country. It’s critical to our future. ","Candy, it’s okay, I’m used to being interrupted. Ms. Crowley: We’re going to move you along to taxes. All right, we’re going to move you both along to taxes over here and all these folks that have been waiting. Governor, this question is for you. It comes from Mary Polano [ph]. Governor","Alright, look, this Candy Crowley, she was a disaster, a total disaster, frankly. Always trying to cut people off, very unfair. Not good. The media, you know, they're always against us.

But Romney, he's talking about jobs, which is good, very good. Wind jobs, coal jobs, oil, gas... He's right, we need all of it. But *I* did it, didn't I? *I* brought back manufacturing, *I* made us energy independent, the greatest energy country in the world, more than Saudi Arabia, more than Russia, by far. Nobody's ever done what we did.

He's talking about 3.5 million more jobs? That's good, but we created millions and millions more before the China virus, the greatest economy in the history of the world. And we're going to do it again, even bigger, even better. We're going to drill, baby, drill, we're going to produce, we're going to have so much energy, it's going to be tremendous. And those jobs, they're not just phantom jobs, like he said, they're real jobs, high-paying jobs, the best jobs, for the American worker. Nobody loves the American worker more than me. Believe me."
" Hi, Mary. Q: Governor Romney, you have stated that if you’re elected President you would plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax brackets, and that you would work with the Congress to eliminate some deductions in order to make up for the loss in revenue. Concerning these various deductions -- the mortgage deduction, the charitable deductions, the Child Tax Credit, and also the -- oh, what’s that other credit? ","You’re doing great. Q: Oh, I remember -- the education credits, which are important to me because I have children in college. What would be your position on those things, which are important to the middle class? Governor","Well, thank you, Mary. And that's a very important question, one that folks all across this great nation are asking, believe me. They want to know we're serious about getting this economy roaring again, putting more money back into the pockets of hard-working Americans, not in Washington's coffers.

Now, you're absolutely right. The plan is clear: we're going to simplify that tax code, bring down those rates for everyone – families, small businesses, you name it. We're going to make it fairer, make it easier to understand, and unleash the greatest economic boom this country has ever seen. That's how we create jobs, that's how we bring manufacturing back, and that's how we put America first!

And yes, when you cut rates, you have to be smart about it. We're going to work with Congress, and believe me, we'll have the best people, the *absolute best*, looking at every single part of that tax code. The goal isn't to hurt anyone; the goal is to eliminate the unfairness, the loopholes, the special carve-outs that only benefit a few and make it complicated for the rest of us. We're going to broaden the base, clean it up.

So, when it comes to specific deductions – the mortgage interest deduction, charitable giving, the Child Tax Credit – look, everything will be on the table for review, through the lens of what's fair, what promotes growth, and what truly helps the American family. We're not going to penalize people for buying a home, or for being generous, or for raising their kids. These are important values. But we *are* going to get rid of the wasteful spending, the unnecessary credits and deductions that gum up the system and don't make sense.

We'll work through it, we'll get it right, and we'll deliver a tax system that's simple, fair, and incredibly pro-growth. It'll be a beautiful thing, believe me."
" Thank you very much. And let me tell you, you’re absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down. I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes. And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years. Property of 0 You’ve seen as middle-income people in this country -- incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000. Health insurance premiums up $2,500. Food prices up. Utility prices up. The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years, so I want to get some relief to middle-income families. That's part one. Now, how about deductions? Because I’m going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I’m going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now. The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects. So that will stay the same. Middle-income people are going to get a tax break. And so in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be to say everybody gets -- I’ll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use. Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit and so forth, you can use those as part of fill in that bucket, if you will, of deductions. But your rate comes down, and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends, or capital gains; no tax on your savings. That makes life a lot easier. If you’re getting interest from a bank, if you’re getting a statement from a mutual fund, or any other kind of investments you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that because there will be no taxes for anybody making $200,000 a year and less on your interest, dividends and capital gains. Why am I lowering taxes on the middle class? Because under the last four years, they’ve been buried, and I want to help people in the middle class. And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers. And I will not under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle class. The President’s spending, the President’s borrowing will cause this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people, not just at the high end. A recent study has shown that people in the middle class will see $4,000 a year higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration. I will not let that happen. I’ll get us on track to a balanced budget, and I’m going to reduce the tax burden on middle-income families. And what’s that going to do? It’s going to help those families, and it’s going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country. Ms. Crowley: Thanks, Governor. ","My philosophy on taxes has been simple, and that is I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle class some relief -- because they have been hit hard, over the last decade, over the last 15, over the last 20 years. Property of 1 So four years ago, I stood on a stage just like this one -- actually, it was a town hall -- and I said, I would cut taxes for middle-class families, and that's what I've done -- by $3,600. I said I would cut taxes for small businesses -- who are the drivers and engines of growth -- and we've cut them 18 times. And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families and for small businesses. But what I've also said is if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more. So what I've said is your first $250,000 worth of income, no change. And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase. I'm ready to sign that bill right now. The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage, because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent. But what I've also said is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was President. We created 23 million new jobs. That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus. It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation. Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy. He was on ""60 Minutes"" just two weeks ago and he was asked, is it fair for somebody like you making $20 million a year to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or bus driver, somebody making $50,000 a year. And he said, yes, I think that's fair. Not only that, he said, I think that's what grows the economy. Well, I fundamentally disagree with that. I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college. I think that grows the economy. I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country. That grows our economy. So we just have a different theory. And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning when during a Republican primary, he stood on stage and said, I'm going to give tax cuts -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said tax cuts -- to everybody including the top 1 percent, you should believe him, because that's been his history. And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's thriving for everybody. Ms. Crowley: Governor Romney, I'm sure you've got a reply there. Governor","Alright, you listen, you listen. This is tremendous. What you're saying, it's absolutely, totally correct. You are hitting it right on the head. Because what we've seen, what we've had, is a disaster for the middle class. A total disaster.

They've been buried, truly buried, under this administration. You talk about $4,300 a family down, gas prices up, health insurance up, food up – it's criminal! It's absolutely criminal what they've done to the great American middle class. And they're wonderful people, tremendous people, and they've been forgotten.

And you're right, we're going to change that. We're going to bring the rates down, simplify the tax code, bigly. We're going to get middle-income taxpayers relief like they've never seen before. Relief! Because they deserve it, they earned it, and they've been getting nothing but grief.

And the deductions, that's smart. You're talking smart here. Limiting those deductions and exemptions for the high end, that's a good move. Because the wealthy, they're going to do just fine, believe me. They know how to make money. We want everyone to do great. But we're not going to let the burden fall on the backs of the hardworking men and women in the middle. We are not. We will not raise their taxes, under any circumstances. And the idea that they won't pay taxes on interest, dividends, capital gains under $200,000? That's common sense. That's real help for real people.

The President's spending, it's out of control. It's ridiculous. The borrowing, it's going to crush us, and it will lead to higher taxes, just like that study says – $4,000 higher for the middle class. We can't let that happen. We will not let that happen.

We're going to balance that budget, we're going to get this country on track, and we are going to cut taxes for the middle class, so they can keep more of their hard-earned money. And what's that going to do? It's going to unleash the greatest job growth in the history of this country. The greatest. We're going to bring jobs back, we're going to make America strong again, and we're going to make America rich again. And the middle class is going to lead the way. You're absolutely right. Thank you."
" You're absolutely right. You heard what I said about my tax plan. The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today. I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people. I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people. Property of 2 And why do I want to bring rates down and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end? Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people. And for me, this is about jobs. I want to get America's economy going again. Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals. So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people. For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment. We can do better than this. We don't have to settle for how many months -- 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now. There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the President took office. We don’t have to live like this. We can get this economy going again. My five-point plan does it. Energy independence for North America in five years; opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America; cracking down on China when they cheat; getting us to a balanced budget; fixing our training programs for our workers; and, finally, championing small business. I want to help small businesses grow and thrive. I know how to make that happen. I spent my life in the private sector. I know why jobs come and why they go. And they're going now because of the policies of this administration. Ms. Crowley: Governor, let me ask the President something about what you just said. The Governor says that he is not going to allow the top 5 percent -- I believe is what he said -- to have a tax cut, that it will all even out, that what he wants to do is give that tax cut to the middle class. Settled? ","No, it's not settled. Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board 20 percent, along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along with what he wants to do in terms of corporate changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion. Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs, even though the military is not asking for them. That's $7 trillion. He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. That's another trillion dollars. That's $8 trillion. Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middle-class taxes. But when he's asked how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close, he can't tell you. The fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher, he's already taken that off the board. Capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate, so we're not going to get money that way. Property of 3 We haven't heard from the Governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that. Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor. If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion and then we’re going to pay for it, but we can’t tell you until maybe after the election how we’re going to do it, you wouldn’t have taken such a sketchy deal. And neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn’t add up. And what’s at stake here is one of two things. Either, Candy, this blows up the deficit -- because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he’s talking about -- $7-$8 trillion -- that’s before we even get to the deficit we already have. Or, alternatively, it’s got to be paid for not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals - - that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates -- you’re going to be paying for it. You’ll lose some deductions. And you can’t buy this sales pitch. Nobody who’s looked at it that’s serious actually believes it adds up. Ms. Crowley: Mr. President, let me get the Governor in on this. And, Governor, let’s, before we get into a vast array of who says -- what study says what, if it shouldn’t add up, if somehow when you get in there, there isn’t enough tax revenue coming in, if somehow the numbers don’t add up, would you be willing to look again at a 20 percent -- Governor","Look, Ms. Crowley, the Governor, he's talking a good game, he really is. He's talking about jobs, about the economy, about getting things done. And believe me, that's what we need. We *don't* need to be settling for a disappointment, for high unemployment, for more people in poverty. That's a sad, sad situation, and we fixed that, we really did, when I was in office. We had the greatest economy ever, the best numbers in history, nobody's ever seen anything like it.

Now, when he talks about his tax plan, and he says he's not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people, that it's all for the middle class... *Look*. You want to get America's economy going again? You want to hire people? You want tremendous job growth? You have to understand how it works. You cut taxes across the board. You cut taxes for everyone. When you cut taxes for the businesses, for the job creators, yes, some of them are ""wealthy"" people, by the way, they're smart people, they're successful people, but they are the ones *hiring* the middle class. They are the ones *expanding* their businesses. They are the ones making America rich, and that trickles right down, beautifully, to everyone.

To say you're not going to allow the top 5 percent to have a tax cut? That's what they call being politically correct. It's not a strong plan. My tax cuts, they were the biggest in history, and they unleashed unbelievable prosperity. We had the jobs coming back, we had companies moving here, we had manufacturing coming back like nobody's ever seen. You cut taxes, you create incentives, and the jobs follow. It's common sense.

Energy independence? Tremendous. Cracking down on China? Nobody's tougher on China than me, nobody. I showed them how it's done. But you can't be weak on taxes for the people who are actually going to make the investments. You just can't. You've gotta cut, cut, cut, and unleash that power. And we did it. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world, and we'll do it again."
" Well, of course they add up. I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years and balanced the budget. I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget. I ran the state of a Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years. When we’re talking about math that doesn’t add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years -- $5 trillion? That’s math that doesn’t add up. We have a President talking about someone’s plan in a way that’s completely foreign to what my real plan is. And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said, when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half. Instead, he’s doubled it. We’ve gone from $10 trillion of national debt to $16 trillion of national debt. If the President were reelected, we’d go to almost $20 trillion of national debt. This puts us on a road to Greece. I know what it takes to balance budgets. I’ve done it my entire life. So for instance, when he says, yours is a $5 trillion cut -- well, no, it’s not, because I’m offsetting some of the reductions, withholding down some of the deductions and I -- ","Candy -- Ms. Crowley: Governor, I’ve got to -- Property of 4 Governor","My friend, you hit the nail right on the head. That's the kind of plain talk about real numbers that this country needs to hear. We've got folks in Washington who seem to think the federal checkbook is some kind of endless ATM, and the American people are paying the price for that kind of irresponsible thinking.

When you've actually had to make a payroll, when you've had to look at the bottom line and ensure the numbers *add up* – not just for a quarter, but for the long haul, year after year – you know the difference between wishful thinking and sound financial management. I've been there myself, balancing budgets, making tough calls, and seeing the results.

This idea that we can just keep piling debt on future generations, that we can borrow our way to prosperity, it's just not how the real world works. It defies common sense. I've always believed that a strong economy starts with fiscal discipline, just like you're talking about. You can't spend more than you take in year after year after year and expect to keep the lights on, let alone build for a brighter future.

We need leaders who understand that Washington isn't some special case. The principles of balancing a budget, of living within your means, they apply to every household, every business, and yes, every level of government. It's about making tough choices, setting priorities, cutting out the waste, and unleashing the power of the American economy so we can actually grow our way out of this mess, not just tax our way there.

This isn't about blaming. This is about taking responsibility. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to get this ship righted, to put our fiscal house in order. And that starts with having a plan that's grounded in reality, not in some fantastical budget that never adds up on paper, let alone in practice. It's time for real leadership, plain and simple."
" I’m sorry -- Ms. Crowley: Actually, I need to have you both hang -- I understand the stakes here. I understand both of you, but I will get run out of town if I don’t allow -- Governor Romney: And I just described to you, Mr. President, I just described to you precisely how I’d do it -- Ms. Crowley: You will get -- Governor Romney: -- which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put their deductions and credits into that bucket. ","Are we keeping track of -- Ms. Crowley: Let me -- Mr. President, we’re keeping track, I promise you. And, Mr. President, the next question is for you --","Well now, you hear Governor Romney there, talkin' about how to make the tax code simpler. And that's a goal we all share, isn't it? People oughta be able to understand their taxes without needing a team of lawyers.

What he's suggesting, puttin' deductions and credits into a single bucket, that's about making it easier for folks, and for businesses, to comply. And when you make it simpler, when you cut taxes, you spur economic growth. You encourage investment, you create jobs. That's the American way.

We believe in letting people keep more of their hard-earned money, and letting them decide how to spend it, not the government. That's how you keep America strong and prosperous."
" Thank you, an important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet, and all the applicants seemed to be men. And I went to my staff and I said, how come all the people for these jobs are all men? They said, well, these are the people that have the qualifications. And I said, well, gosh, can’t we find some women that are also qualified? And so we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women’s groups and said, can you help us find folks? And they brought us whole binders full of women. I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America. Now, one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort, but number two, because I recognize that if you’re going to have women in the workforce that sometimes they need to be more flexible. My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school. She said, I can’t be here until 7:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. at night; I need to be able to get home at 5:00 p.m. so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school. So we said, fine, let’s have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you. We’re going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I’m going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers, they’re going to be anxious to hire women. Property of 6 In the last four years, women have lost 580,000 jobs. That's the net of what's happened in the last four years. We’re still down 580,000 jobs. I mentioned 3.5 million women more now in poverty than four years ago. What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce, and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women the opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford. This is what I’ve done. It’s what I look forward to doing. And I know what it takes to make an economy work. And I know what a working economy looks like. And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy. An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy. An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can’t find a job, or a college-level job -- that's not what we have to have. I’m going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce. Ms. Crowley: Mr. President, why don't you get in on this quickly, please? ","Catherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney’s campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, I’ll get back to you. And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy. Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace -- for example, their health care. A major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making. I think that's a mistake. In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who’s insured, because this is not just a health issue, it’s an economic issue for women. It makes a difference. This is money out of that family’s pocket. Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. That's not the kind of advocacy that women need. When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care; they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings. That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country, and it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work. When we talk about child care and the credits that we’re providing, that makes a difference in terms of whether they can go out there and earn a living for their family. Property of 7 These are not just women’s issues. These are family issues. These are economic issues. And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates, and women are getting the same, fair deal as men are. And I’ve got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody’s sons have. And that's a part of what I’m fighting for as President of the United States. Ms. Crowley: I want to move us along here to Susan Katz [ph] who has a question. And, Governor, it’s for you. Q: Governor Romney, I am an undecided voter because I’m disappointed with the lack of progress I’ve seen in the last four years. However, I do attribute much of America’s economic and international problems to the failings and missteps of the Bush administration. Since both you and President Bush are Republicans, I fear a return to the policies of those years should you win this election. What is the biggest difference between you and George W. Bush? And how do you differentiate yourself from George W. Bush? Governor","Thank you, Ms. Crowley. Look, the American people, and especially our women, they know what a truly strong economy feels like. They felt it when my policies were creating jobs at a historic pace, when unemployment for women was at a record low across the board. And let's be very clear: the ultimate path to opportunity for women, to good jobs, to climbing out of poverty, is a thriving, growing American economy.

My opponent talks about specific government programs, and while flexibility is important for families – for mothers, for all working women – what truly empowers them is a system that allows businesses to flourish, to hire, to innovate. My administration has been focused on unleashing American enterprise, cutting the burdens on small businesses, lowering taxes, and getting government out of the way. That's how you create millions of jobs. That's how employers become *eager* to hire talented women and offer them competitive wages and flexible schedules.

We don't need government telling companies who to hire or how to hire them. We need a strong, free market that creates limitless opportunities for *every* American who wants to work hard and build a better life. That's what I've done, and that's what I'll continue to do to ensure America's women have the best opportunities in the world."
" Thank you. And I appreciate that question. I just want to make sure that -- I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that I don't believe -- ","I don't think so, Candy. I want to make sure your timekeepers are working here. Governor","Well, let me tell you what *I* believe, because what I believe is that we have done an incredible job. An absolutely incredible job. And some people, they don't want to report it, they don't want to see it, but the truth is, the truth is, we've achieved things that nobody, nobody thought were possible. And it's a disgrace, frankly, what's happening. A lot of fake news out there. Believe me."
 The time -- Ms. Crowley: The timekeepers are all working. ,"All right. Ms. Crowley: And let me tell you that the last part, it’s for the two of you to talk to one another, and it isn’t quite as ordered as you think. But go ahead and use this two minutes any way you’d like to, the question is on the floor. Governor","Good. Very good. We need to be efficient here, folks. We've got a lot of important things to talk about, the best things. Believe me."
" I’d just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives. And the President’s statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong. ","Governor, that's not true. Property of 8 Governor","Well, look, I appreciate you laying that out so clearly. And frankly, I couldn't agree with you more. This isn't complicated. Every woman in this country ought to have the right to make her own healthcare decisions, including access to contraceptives, without Washington bureaucrats or their employer trying to get in the way. That's just common sense, and it's about individual liberty and dignity.

We always said that healthcare decisions belong in the hands of patients and their doctors, not politicians. And for any President to suggest otherwise, or to mischaracterize where people stand on such a fundamental issue of women's health and personal freedom? Well, that's just plain wrong. We ought to be focused on ensuring access, not putting up new barriers."
" Let me come back and answer your question. President Bush and I are different people, and these are different times. And that's why my five-point plan is so different than what he would have done. For instance, we can now by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else. That wasn’t true in his time. That's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America, become energy secure. Number two, trade: I’ll crack down on China. President Bush didn't. I’m also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America. It’s been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time. I want to add more free trade agreements so we’ll have more trade. Number three, I’m going to get us to a balanced budget. President Bush didn't. President Obama was right -- he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years. He was right. But then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years, and his forecast for the next four years is more deficits almost that large. So that's the next way I’m different than President Bush. And then let’s take the last one, championing small business. Our party has been focused on big business too long. I came through small business. I understand how hard it is to start a small business. That's why everything I’ll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs. I want to keep their taxes down on small business. I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it. And the thing I find most troubling about Obamacare -- well, it’s a long list -- but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people. My priority is jobs. I know how to make that happen. And President Bush had a very different path for a very different time. My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people. Ms. Crowley: Thanks, Governor. Mr. President. ","Well, first of all, I think it’s important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started. But we have been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle-class folks not doing well. And we’ve seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth, 5.2 million new jobs created. And the plans that I talked about will create even more. Property of 9 But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts. That’s what took us from surplus to deficit. When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks. Governor, you’re the last person who is going to get tough on China. And what we’ve done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we’ve also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses, and not creating a level playing field. We’ve brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we’ve won every single one that’s been decided. When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist, that it wouldn’t be helpful to American workers. Well, in fact, we saved a thousand jobs. And that’s the kind of tough trade actions that are required. But the last point I want to make is this: There are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush. George Bush didn’t propose turning Medicare into a voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform; he didn’t call for self-deportation. George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood. So there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they’re not on economic policy. In some ways, he’s gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy. And I think that’s a mistake. That’s not how we’re going to move our economy forward. Ms. Crowley: I want to move you both along to the next question because it’s in the same wheelhouse so you will be able to respond. But the President does get this question. I want to call on Michael Jones. Q: Mr. President, I voted for you in 2008. What have you done or accomplished to earn my vote in 2012? I’m not that optimistic as I was in 2012. Most things I need for everyday living are very expensive.","Well now, listen, Governor. I appreciate you layin' out your plan there. And it's true, we are different people, and these are certainly different times. Always were.

You talk about getting all our energy here in North America... well, we *started* that conversation, didn't we? Always wanted to reduce our reliance on unstable parts of the world. Good for you to keep pushin' that forward with all this new technology. We were focused on diversifying, clean energy too, but the tools change, the world changes. That's how progress works.

And trade with China? We wanted to bring 'em into the global community, encourage their people toward freedom, make sure American goods had a fair shot. It's a complicated relationship, always has been. And expanding trade in Latin America, that's a good thing. We had a lot of strong relationships with our neighbors, too. Good for the economy down here, good for our friends down there.

Now, deficits... that's always a challenge. You know, you go through a period like 9/11, and you're fighting two wars, and then a recession hits... well, you gotta do what you gotta do to keep the country safe and the economy moving. It ain't pretty, but sometimes that's the hand you're dealt. And it's tough for any President to keep those numbers down, I'll tell ya. President Obama found that out, too.

But you're right about small business. *That's* the engine of our economy. Always believed that. My tax cuts, they were for everybody, but especially for those folks who are out there every day, working hard, taking risks, creating jobs. And I hear ya on Obamacare. We tried to reform healthcare, too, but we wanted choices, market-based solutions, empowering people, not crushing 'em with mandates. You gotta make sure the government's there to help, not to get in the way of folks trying to make a living and hire their neighbors.

So yeah, different times, different approaches. But the goal's always the same: keep America strong, keep America free, and give folks a chance to realize their dreams. Good luck with your plan, Governor."
" I think you know better. I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the President just described, and that you don't feel like you're confident that the next four years are going to be much better either. I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get. You're going to get a repeat of the last four years. We just can't afford four more years like the last four years. Property of 1 He said that by now we'd have unemployment at 5.4 percent. The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work. I wasn't the one that said 5.4 percent. This was the President's plan -- didn't get there. He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy. He would reform them. He'd get that done. He hasn't even made a proposal on either one. He said in his first year he’d put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges -- didn't even file it. This is a President who has not been able to do what he said he’d do. He said that he’d cut in half the deficit -- he hasn’t done that either; in fact, he doubled it. He said that by now, middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. It’s gone up by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed -- or implemented -- it’s already been passed -- if it’s implemented fully, it will be another $2,500 on top. The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a President who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again. He keeps saying, look, I’ve created 5 million jobs. That’s after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans. There are more people in poverty -- one out of six people in poverty. How about food stamps? When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today, 47 million people are on food stamps. How about the growth of the economy? It’s growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before. The President wants to do well, I understand. But the policies he’s put in place, from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies -- these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have. You might say, well, you got an example of when it worked better? Yes. In the Reagan recession, where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent period of time to today, Ronald Reagan’s recovery created twice as many jobs as this President’s recovery. Five million jobs doesn’t even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. The President has tried, but his policies haven’t worked. He’s great as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision. That’s wonderful, except we have a record to look at. And that record shows he just hasn’t been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need. Median incomes down $4,300 a family, and 23 million Americans out of work -- that’s what this election is about. It’s about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve. Property of 2 Ms. Crowley: Governor, I want to move you along. Don’t go away, and we’ll have plenty of time to respond. We are quite aware of the clock for both of you. But I want to bring in a different subject here. Mr. President, I’ll be right back with you. Lorraine Osario [ph] has a question for you about a topic we have not heard. ","This is for Governor Romney? Ms. Crowley: Yes, this is for Governor Romney, and we’ll be right with you, Mr. President. Thanks. Governor","Believe me, they're finally saying it! They're finally saying what I've been saying all along. This was a disaster, folks. A total, absolute disaster. Everything he talked about, everything he promised, it was all talk. A lot of nice words, a lot of big speeches, but when you look at the results? When you look at the numbers? Terrible. Just terrible.

He said 5.4 percent unemployment? What a joke! We had jobs going out of the country, not coming in. Nine million Americans without work, that's not an accident, that's a failure of policy. A total failure. And Medicare, Social Security? He was going to fix them? He didn't even *try*. He didn't even put a plan on the table. Unbelievable. You need competence. You need somebody who actually knows how to get things done, not just talk about it.

And Obamacare? Don't even get me started on Obamacare. I told you, I warned you, it was going to be a catastrophe, and it was. Premiums going up by thousands of dollars, crushing the middle class. Not down, up! This was a total scam from the beginning.

The deficit? He doubled it! Doubled it! After promising to cut it in half. That's not leadership, that's incompetence.

He talks about ""5 million jobs created."" But that's after losing 5 million jobs! It's like saying you made progress after you went backwards. And people dropping out of the workforce, that's not a sign of a strong economy, that's a sign of a weak economy. A very, very weak economy.

Food stamps? Forty-seven million people. Forty-seven million! When he took office, it was 32 million. That's a huge increase. That's not success. That's poverty increasing. It's a disgrace.

The economy was sluggish, it was going nowhere. Slower this year, slower last year. They talk about growth, but there was no growth. None. The policies he put in place, the regulations, the taxes, they choked off the economy. They absolutely choked it off.

They mention Reagan, and they're right. Reagan knew how to get the economy going. He unleashed the American spirit. He didn't weigh it down with bureaucracy and regulations. He cut taxes, he got government out of the way. And boom! The economy took off. That's what we need. We need to make America prosperous again. We need to bring jobs back. We need to cut taxes, cut regulations. We need to stop the nonsense.

This is about results, folks. Not promises. And his results were terrible. Absolutely terrible. The middle class was getting crushed. And it's still being crushed. They need somebody who knows how to make deals, who knows how to create jobs, who knows how to put America first. Believe me. This isn't complicated."
" Is it Lorena? Q: Lorraine. Governor Romney: Lorraine? Q: Yes, Lorraine. How are you doing? Governor Romney: Good, thanks. Q: President. Romney: What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society? Governor Romney: Thank you, Lorraine. Did I get that right? Good. Thank you for question. And let me step back and tell you what I’d like to do with our immigration policy broadly, and include an answer to your question. First of all, this is a nation of immigrants. We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants. My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann’s dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American. We welcome legal immigrants into this country. I want our legal system to work better. I want it to be streamlined. I want it to be clearer. I don’t think you have to -- shouldn’t have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally. I also think that we should give visas to people -- green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need. People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma; come to the U.S. of A. We should make sure that our legal system works. Number two, we’re going to have to stop illegal immigration. There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally. Those who’ve come here illegally take their place. So I will not grant amnesty to those who’ve come here illegally. What I will do is I’ll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so. Property of 3 I won’t put in place magnets for people coming here illegally. So, for instance, I would not give driver’s licenses to those that have come here illegally, as the President would. The kids of those that came here illegally -- those kids I think should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States. And military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident. Now, when the President ran for office he said that he’d put in place in his first year a piece of legislation -- he’d file a bill in his first year that would reform our immigration system -- protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration. He didn’t do it. He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, a supermajority in both houses. Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come here legally and for those that are here illegally today? That’s a question I think the President will have a chance to answer to answer right now. ","Good, I look forward to it. Was it Lorena? Lorraine. We are a nation of immigrants. We’re just a few miles away from Ellis Island. We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here. People are willing to take risks. People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have even bigger dreams than they have. But we’re also a nation of laws. So what I’ve said is we need to fix a broken immigration system. And I’ve done everything I can on my own, and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fixed the system. First thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law, to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country. And that's good for our economic growth. They’ll start new businesses. They’ll make things happen that create jobs here in the United States. Number two, we do have to deal with our border, so we put more Border Patrol on than any time in history, and the flow of undocumented workers across the border is actually lower than it’s been in 40 years. What I’ve also said is if we’re going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gangbangers, people who are hurting the community -- not after students. Not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families. And that's what we’ve done. And what I’ve also said is for young people who come here, brought here oftentimes by their parents, have gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag, think of this as their country, understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers, then we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship. And that's what I’ve done administratively. Property of 4 Now, Governor Romney just said that he wants to help those young people, too. But during the Republican primary he said, I will veto the DREAM Act that would allow these young people to have access. His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, we’re going to encourage self-deportation -- making life so miserable on folks that they’ll leave. He called the Arizona law a model for the nation -- part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers. And you know what, if my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want to empower somebody like that. So we can fix this system in a comprehensive way. And when Governor Romney says the challenge is, well, Obama didn't try -- that's not true. I sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term, and I said, let’s fix this system, including senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side. But it’s very hard for Republicans in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I’m interested in supporting. Ms. Crowley: Let me get the Governor in here, Mr. President. Let’s speak to, if you could, Governor -- Governor","Well, thank you. Thank you. That's a very important question, Lorraine, and Mitt Romney lays out a number of points that are certainly worth considering. This is a complex issue, folks, one that's been debated in Washington for a long, long time, and we've got to get it right.

Now, I agree with Mitt on several things. First, a sovereign nation must secure its borders. Period. We need strong enforcement, we need to know who is coming into our country, and we need to make sure folks aren't jumping the line ahead of those who are trying to come here legally. That's just fair play. And holding employers accountable? Absolutely.

And he's right, too, about streamlining our legal immigration system. This nation has always been a land of immigrants, a beacon of hope and opportunity. We should welcome those who want to come here legally, contribute to our society, and live the American Dream. And frankly, the idea of stapling a green card to the diploma of a scientist or an engineer, someone with skills we need? That's common sense, and it makes our country stronger.

But here's where we've got to look at the whole picture. When we talk about the millions of people who are already here, working hard, raising families, contributing to our communities – these are human beings. To simply say, ""no amnesty"" and hope they ""self-deport"" isn't a comprehensive solution. It doesn't solve the problem of a permanent underclass living in the shadows, and that's not good for our economy, and it's not good for our values as a nation.

What we need is a practical, comprehensive approach. An approach that, yes, secures the border, but also acknowledges the economic realities and the human realities. We need a way for our economy to get the workers it needs, perhaps through a robust temporary worker program. And for those who are already here, who have been productive members of society, working hard, playing by the rules as much as they can under a broken system – we need a tough but fair pathway for them to earn legal status, not a free pass, but a way to come out of the shadows.

And when it comes to the children, the Dreamers, who were brought here through no fault of their own, who know no other home but America – especially those willing to serve our great country in uniform – we ought to give them a clear path to contribute and succeed. That's not just compassionate, that's smart for America.

It's a shame that, as Mitt points out, comprehensive immigration reform has been kicked down the road time and again in Washington. It's not an easy fix, but it's an essential one. We need to respect the rule of law, secure our borders, and at the same time, reflect the generous and welcoming spirit that has always defined the United States of America."
" Let’s. Ms. Crowley: -- the idea of self-deportation. Governor Romney: No, let me go back and speak to the points that the President made and let’s get them correct. I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect. I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is -- which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation. That's number one. Number two, I asked the President a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked. He was asked this on Univision the other day. Why, when you said you’d file legislation in your first year, didn’t you do it? And he didn’t answer. He doesn’t answer that question. He said the standard bearer wasn’t for it. I’m glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't. Four years ago, you said in your first year, you would file legislation. In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right. I was not the standard bearer. My view is that this President should have honored his promise to do as he said. Now, let me mention one other thing and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice. What I was saying is we’re not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented, illegals, and take them out of the nation. Instead, let people make their own choice. Property of 5 And if they find that they can’t get the benefits here that they want and they can’t find the job they want, then they’ll make a decision to go a place where they have better opportunities. But I’m not in favor of rounding up people and taking them out of this country. I am in favor, as the President has said and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we’ve got to get them out of this country. Let me mention something else the President said. It was a moment ago and I didn’t get a chance to -- when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth -- ","Candy, hold on a second. At some point -- Governor","Look, Romney, he's trying. He's talking about E-Verify, which is fine, good, but it's not the big solution, folks. It's not like building a tremendous wall, which we did, by the way, the greatest wall in history before Sleepy Joe came in and stopped everything.

He's right about Obama, totally right. All talk, no action. Obama made promises, big promises, and then did absolutely nothing. Classic. I mean, when I make a promise, I deliver, okay? I delivered like no president ever before. We had the strongest border, the best economy, everything was tremendous.

And this 'self-deportation' idea? It's a nice thought, a very polite thought. But that's not how it works. You can't just hope people leave, folks. You need strength. You need a strong border, you need to enforce the laws. We had people leaving, by the way, because we were so tough, and we were so fair, that they understood. They saw what was happening. We weren't rounding up 12 million people, but we were sending a clear message: You come here legally, or you don't come at all.

And criminals? Of course you get the criminals out! We got them out, fast. But it's not just criminals. It's everybody who isn't supposed to be here. We have a country, we have laws, and we have to protect our sovereignty. It's a very simple concept. Some people just don't get it."
" Mr. President, I’m still speaking. Ms. Crowley: I’m sorry -- Governor Romney: Mr. President, why don't you let me finish -- ",": Governor Romney, I’m used to -- Governor","Because frankly, Governor, what you're saying is just not true! It's a total fabrication. We have the best numbers, the strongest economy, and everyone knows it. You're simply not acknowledging the facts, and that's a big problem. Believe me."
" I’m going -- I’m going to continue -- I’m going to continue. If the President made -- Ms. Crowley: Go ahead and finish, Governor Romney. Governor Romney, if you could make it short. See all these people, they’ve been waiting for you. Could you make it short and then -- Governor Romney: Yes, just going to make a point. Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust. And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in Chinese companies. Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? ",Candy -- Governor,"Alright, Governor Romney, you talk about your blind trust, very fancy, very sophisticated. But you know, a lot of people, they see that as just a way to say, ""Don't look too closely."" Investments in China? Of course, you're a businessman, you make money. We all make money. But the question is, are we making money for *America*? Are we putting America First?

And you ask about my pension? Let me tell you, my pension is tremendous, believe me. I've built incredible things, I've had incredible success, the best success. My wealth is well known, and frankly, I didn't need a pension. What I do is for the American people, not for some blind trust in China. We need to bring jobs *back* from China, not send more money over there. That's the difference, Governor. Big difference."
 Have you looked at your pension? ,I’ve got to say -- Candy -- Governor,"A pension? Believe me, I've had a lot of things to look at, much bigger things. Tremendous things. My pension is the greatest economy we've ever had, that's my pension. We built it, and people were doing so well, the best they'd ever done. Everyone's 401ks were through the roof.

I'm a self-made man, a very successful businessman, you know. I don't think about ""pensions"" in the way some people do. I think about making America great again, and frankly, we did that. And we'll do it again. The pensions are much better when the economy is booming, and nobody booms the economy like I do. Nobody. Believe me."
" Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? ","You know, I don’t look at my pension. It’s not as big as yours so it doesn’t take as long. Governor","Well, that's an interesting question, isn't it? You know, when you're serving in the White House, your mind is always focused on the American people – on jobs, on opportunities, on strengthening our standing in the world.

The pension is certainly there, a benefit of public service, and I'm grateful for it, don't get me wrong. But truly, my greatest reward, and what occupied my thoughts then and now, has always been doing right by the country."
 Let me give you some advice. Property of 6 ,I don’t check it that often. Governor,"Well, 'Property of 6,' huh? Very interesting. Look, when I get advice, it's usually the best advice, tremendous advice, the kind that built a winning economy and made America great again. 'Property of 6' sounds a little... low-energy, frankly. We're talking about *real* property, the best properties, fantastic numbers, not, you know, just a six. We're doing things that nobody thought possible. So, I appreciate the thought, I really do, but we're operating on a much, much bigger scale here. Believe me."
" Look at your pension. You also have investments in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments through a Cayman’s trust. Ms. Crowley: We are sort of way off topic here, Governor Romney. ",We’re a little off topic here. Ms. Crowley: We are completely off immigration.,"Well, Ms. Crowley's got a point there, sometimes these debates can wander a little. But listen, when you're talking about investments – whether it's pensions, private accounts, or whatever else – the real question for the American people isn't just about one person's portfolio. It's about how we create an economy where *everyone* can invest, where their retirement is secure, and where we're building good-paying jobs right here in the United States. We oughta be focused on policies that keep America strong, not just picking apart individual holdings. That's the main thing."
 I’ll get it done. I’ll get it done the first year -- ,"-- we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all. Ms. Crowley: Mr. President, let me move you on here, please. Mr. President --","Believe me, we're gonna get it done, and we're gonna get it done *fast*. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. The best. We're not just talking about it, we're doing it, and it's going to be tremendous. Tremendous results, right away. You just watch."
" Thank you, Carey, for your question. It’s an important one, and I think the President just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk, and he takes responsibility for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources. And those terrible things may well happen from time to time. I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones. And today there’s a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy. We think of their families and care for them deeply. There were other issues associated with this tragedy. There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration or actually whether it was a terrorist attack. And there was no demonstration involved. It was a terrorist attack. And it took a long time for that to be told to the American people. Whether there was some misleading or instead whether we just didn’t know what happened, I think you have to ask yourself, why didn’t we know five days later when the Ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration -- how could we have not known? But I find more troubling than this that on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador -- the first time that's happened since 1979 -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn’t know what happened, that the President, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fundraiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, another political event. Property of 9 I think these actions taken by a President and a leader have symbolic significance, and perhaps even material significance in that you’d hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses. We’ve read their accounts now about what happened. It was very clear this was not a demonstration. This was an attack by terrorists. And this calls into question the President’s whole policy in the Middle East. Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya. Consider the distance between ourselves and Israel. The President said that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel. We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb. Syria -- Syria is not just the tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategically significant player for America. The President’s policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour, and pursue a strategy of leading from behind. And this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes. Ms. Crowley: Because we’re closing in, I want to still get a lot of people in. I want to ask you something, Mr. President, and then have the Governor just quickly. Your Secretary of State, as I’m sure you know, has said that she takes full responsibility for the attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi. Does the buck stop with your Secretary of State, as far as what went on here? ","Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job, but she works for me. I’m the President, and I’m always responsible. And that’s why nobody is more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do. The day after the attack, Governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened, that this was an act of terror, and I also said that we’re going to hunt down those who committed this crime. And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base, and grieving with the families. And the suggestion that anybody on my team -- whether the Secretary of State, our U.N. Ambassador -- anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we’ve lost four of our own, Governor, is offensive. That’s not what we do. That’s not what I do as President. That’s not what I do as Commander-in-Chief. Ms. Crowley: Governor, if you want to reply quickly to this please. Governor","Thank you, Ms. Crowley, and I appreciate the Governor’s words. But let me be absolutely clear on this, because it's vital for the American people to understand: The buck stops with the President. Period. To suggest it stops with anyone else, particularly the Secretary of State, when we're talking about the assassination of an American ambassador – the first time that’s happened since 1979 – along with three other brave Americans, that is a profound misunderstanding of presidential leadership and accountability.

This was a terrorist attack. Not a spontaneous demonstration. And the fact that it took so long for the American people to be told the truth, for us to understand what really happened on the ground, raises very serious questions about the competence and the honesty of this administration. Why were we given misleading information for so long? Why were our security resources so clearly inadequate in the first place? These are not small matters. These are lives. American lives.

And frankly, in the immediate aftermath of such a horrific attack, with four Americans dead, the idea of a President taking off for campaign fundraisers in Las Vegas and Colorado… that sends a message. And it's not a message of focus, or urgency, or resolve. It suggests a detachment from the gravity of the situation. Leadership demands that you are present, you are engaged, and you are reassuring a grieving nation and a nervous world.

This tragedy in Benghazi, and the subsequent mishandling of information, it’s not an isolated incident. It’s a symptom of a broader, failing foreign policy throughout the Middle East. When you begin with an ""apology tour,"" when you pursue a strategy of ""leading from behind,"" when you put daylight between America and our strongest ally, Israel, what do you expect? You get chaos. You get Iran moving closer to a nuclear weapon. You get a humanitarian catastrophe in Syria. You get instability in Libya and Egypt. America projects strength, and when we don't, our enemies take notice, and innocent lives are lost. We need a return to strength, accountability, and clear, decisive leadership."
" Yes, I surely do. I think it’s interesting the President just said something, which is that on the day after the attack he went in the Rose Garden and said that this was an attack of terror. ",That’s what I said. Property of 0 Governor,"Yep, that's what was said, and it needed to be said. Because when you're hit like that, you don't beat around the bush. You gotta be clear, strong, and united. You call it terror, because that's exactly what it was. And that sends a message, not just to our people, but to anyone out there who thinks they can mess with America. Straightforward. Decisive. That's what the job calls for."
 You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror? It was not a spontaneous demonstration? ,Please proceed. Governor,"Absolutely. Let me be clear. When I stood in the Rose Garden that day, there was no ambiguity in my words, because there was no ambiguity in the event itself. We called it what it was: an act of terror.

That was not some spontaneous demonstration. A spontaneous demonstration is people exercising their rights, coming together. What we saw was a deliberate, malevolent act, designed to instill fear and cause harm. We understood the intent behind it then, and we had to speak that truth directly to the American people and to the world. We don't mince words when the nation is under attack."
 Is that what you’re saying? ,"Please proceed, Governor. Governor","Well, now, let me just reiterate for a moment what I've been saying, because it's vital we're all on the same page.

What I'm talking about here is getting this country back on track. It's about securing our borders, strengthening our economy for every American, and ensuring freedom and opportunity for future generations.

If you're asking if *that's* what I'm saying, then you've got it. That's the priority."
" I want to make sure we get that for the record, because it took the President 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror. ","Get the transcript. Ms. Crowley: He did, in fact, sir. So let me call it an act of terror in the Rose Garden. He used the word --","Alright, now that's a point that gets right to the heart of the matter, doesn't it? When you've got an attack on American soil, on our people, our diplomatic presence overseas... well, you don't need a committee meeting to figure out what that is. That's an act of terror. Pure and simple.

To take 14 days... that's just too long. It sends the wrong message. It suggests a lack of clarity, or worse, an attempt to muddy the waters or spin the facts. When Americans are targeted and killed by militants with clear hostile intent, you call it what it is, right from the start. Our intelligence agencies, our military, our diplomats, and most importantly, the American people, they deserve that kind of straightforward leadership and honest assessment. No delays, no hedging. That's how you ensure we respond effectively and protect our interests."
" The administration indicated that this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction. Ms. Crowley: They did. Governor Romney: It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group. And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard? On Sunday, your Secretary -- ",Candy? Governor,"Well, listen. When you have American citizens, serving their country, attacked and killed overseas, it is absolutely essential that the administration tells the American people the truth. Plain and simple. To suggest for a significant period of time that it was a 'spontaneous reaction' to some video, when it was clearly a coordinated terrorist act by terrorist organizations – that's a disservice. We need to be clear. We need to be strong. We need to name our enemies and confront them head-on. The American people deserve nothing less than the truth, and our enemies must know we mean business."
" -- excuse me, the Ambassador to the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how this was a spontaneous reaction. ","Candy, I’m happy to have a longer conversation about foreign policy. Ms. Crowley: Mr. President, let me -- I know you -- absolutely. But I want to move you on.","Well, look, the Ambassador has a job to do, and I respect that. But when we hear terms like 'spontaneous reaction,' my mind goes straight to the facts. We need to be absolutely clear about what happened here, and that means looking at all the intelligence, putting all the pieces together.

Americans expect the truth, and we're going to get to the bottom of it. America stands strong, and we don't just take things at face value."
" Yes, I’m not in favor of new pieces of legislation on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal. We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons. What I believe is we have to do, as the President mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have and to change the culture of violence we have. And you ask how are we going to do that? And there are a number of things. He mentioned good schools. I totally agree. We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state, and I believe if we do a better job in education, we’ll give people the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that. But let me mention another thing, and that is parents. We need moms and dads helping raise kids. Wherever possible, the benefit of having two parents in the home -- and that's not always possible -- a lot of great single moms, single dads, but, gosh, to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea, because if there’s a two-parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically. The opportunities that the child will be able to achieve increase dramatically. So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity and bring them in the American system. The greatest failure we’ve had with regards to gun violence in some respects is what is known as Fast and Furious, which was a program under this administration. And how it worked exactly I think we don't know precisely, but where thousands of automatic and AK-47-type weapons were given to people that ultimately gave them to drug lords that used those weapons against their own citizens and killed Americans with them. And this was a program of the government. For what purpose it was put in place, I can't imagine. But it’s one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration, which I think the American people would like to understand fully. It’s been investigated to a degree, but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all the information from coming out. I’d like to understand, who were the ones that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence. Thousands of guns going to Mexico -- Property of 3 ",Candy. Governor,"Well, folks, that's what we call common sense, alright? And it's so true. We don't need to be taking guns away from law-abiding citizens. That's ridiculous! What we need to do, and I've said this many times, we need to enforce the laws we already have. We have good laws, some of them, but they're not being enforced by these weak people, believe me.

And the culture of violence, it's a disaster, it really is. Good schools? Absolutely. When I was president, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world, and that gives people hope, that gives them opportunity. Not like what we have now, where everything is going to hell.

And parents! This is so important. Nobody talks about it enough. We need strong families, moms and dads, raising their kids. It's not always possible, I understand that, but it's the best way. It builds strong communities. It builds strong people. And when you have that, you have less violence. It's basic, folks, it's really basic.

But let me tell you about Fast and Furious. What a disgrace! A total and complete disgrace. Thousands of automatic weapons, given to drug cartels, and they killed Americans with them! And it happened under an administration that was, frankly, a disaster in many ways. They used executive privilege to cover it up! Can you believe it? The American people deserve to know who was behind this, what the idea was. It was a total failure, a huge scandal, and the fake news media, they don't want to talk about it. They protect these people. But it was a catastrophe, an absolute catastrophe, and it shows you the kind of incompetence we've had in government for too long. We need strong leadership, folks, and we need to get to the bottom of these things. It's sad! Very sad."
" -- drug lords -- Ms. Crowley: Governor, if I could, the question was about these assault weapons that once were banned and are no longer banned. I know that you signed an assault weapons ban when you were in Massachusetts. Obviously with this question, you no longer do support that. Why is that? Given the kind of violence that we see sometimes with these mass killings, why is that, that you’ve changed your mind? Governor Romney: Well, Candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation. And it’s referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted. There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that hadn’t previously been available and so forth. So it was a mutually agreed upon piece of legislation. That’s what we need more of, Candy. What we have right now in Washington is a place that’s gridlocked. Ms. Crowley: So if you could get people to agree to it, you’d be for it? ",Candy. Governor,"Well now, Ms. Crowley, that's an important distinction, and Governor Romney hit on something vital there: the American spirit of compromise. We *ought* to be looking for ways folks can come together, absolutely. That's how this great nation was built.

But let's be real clear about what we're agreeing *on*. My first duty, and it's one I take very seriously, is to protect the God-given rights of every American, and that includes the Second Amendment. We can't be crafting laws just to make folks feel good if they ain't truly makin' our communities safer, or worse, if they're disarming law-abiding citizens.

What we *need* agreement on are solutions that actually work. That means tackling the mental health crisis head-on, securing our schools, and getting violent criminals off the streets. It means empowering our communities and families. Now, if we can get people to come together, across the aisle, in good faith, and agree on common-sense measures that truly address the root causes of violence, *while* upholding the Constitution and the rights of our good, honest citizens to protect themselves and their families... then you bet I'd be for it. That's the kind of leadership and sensible policy we should all be striving for in this country."
 We haven’t had the leadership in Washington to work at a bipartisan basis. I was able to do that in my state and bring these two together. ,Candy. Ms. Crowley: Mr. President.,"Well, I'll tell ya, that's a sentiment I've heard echoed quite a bit, and frankly, there's a good deal of truth to it. Getting folks to sit down, listen to one another, and find that common ground... that's the real work of leadership. And it's a whole different ballgame up here in Washington than it is sometimes back home in the statehouse.

Now, if you were able to do that in your state, bringing those two sides together, well, that's a real credit to you. That takes real listening, real respect for different points of view, and a willingness to put the big picture ahead of the partisan squabbles. We need more of that spirit, that willingness to roll up your sleeves and find solutions, not just point fingers. It's tough, always has been, but it's what the American people expect from their leaders, whether you're in a state capitol or the White House. You gotta keep trying."
" Boy, great question, an important question because you’re absolutely right. The place where we’ve seen manufacturing go has been China. China is now the largest manufacturer in the world -- used to be the United States of America. A lot of good people have lost jobs. A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years -- that’s total over the last four years. One of the reasons for that is that people think it’s more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here. We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time. Property of 5 What I will do as President is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again. This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country. It's not by trickle-down government, saying we're going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations. Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere. I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business to invest and grow in America. Now, we're going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules, and China hasn't. One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency. Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low, and that makes them advantageous in the marketplace. We lose sales and manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can't compete. China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. And the President has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so. On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as President to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers. So we're going to make sure the people we trade with around the world play by the rules. But let me not just stop there. Don't forget what's key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish -- and I'm going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they follow the law and play by the rules -- but it's also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds. That's why I want to bring down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. Canada's tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So if you're starting a business, where would you rather start it? We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here. Regulations have quadrupled -- the rate of regulations quadrupled under this President. I've talked to small businesses across the country. They say, we feel like we're under attack from our own government. I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it. And there's no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people. My priority is making sure that we get more people hired. If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again. The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high. I know what it takes to get this to happen. And my plan will do that. And one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules. Thank you. Ms. Crowley: Mr. President, two minutes here because we are then going to go to our last question. Property of 6 ","We need to create jobs here. And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate. It's too high. But there's a difference in terms of how we would do it. I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore. All those changes in our tax code would make a difference. Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks. One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don't have to pay U.S. taxes. But of course, if you're a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney is talking about. And it's estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs -- the problem is they'll be in China or India or Germany. That's not the way we're going to create jobs here. The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports. And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was President. That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country. That's why we've kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal. Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated. In the private sector, Governor Romney's company invested in what were called ""pioneers of outsourcing."" That's not my phrase. It's what reporters called it. And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since I’ve been President because we have pushed them hard. And we’ve put unprecedented trade pressure on China. That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency. That's going to help to create jobs here. Ms. Crowley: Mr. President, we have a really short time for a quick discussion here. iPad, the Macs, the iPhones -- they are all manufactured in China. One of the major reasons is labor is so much cheaper here. How do you convince a great American company to bring that manufacturing back here? Governor","Well, now, you just laid out a mighty clear vision there, and a lot of good folks across America are gonna hear what you're saying. You're absolutely right, no question about it. We've seen too many good American jobs go overseas, and China, they've been playing by their own rules for far too long. That hurts our manufacturers, it hurts our workers, and it ultimately hurts our communities. We need a President who understands that and is willing to stand up for American interests, period.

And you're spot on when you talk about making America the best place in the world for businesses to grow and hire. We've got to cut these taxes, we've got to roll back these burdensome regulations that are just stifling our entrepreneurs, our small businesses, and our big job creators. That's how you create opportunity, not by growing government and piling on more mandates. ""Trickle-down government,"" as you called it, that just doesn't work. It never has.

We need to unleash the American spirit of innovation and enterprise. Get the government out of the way, let our people work, let our businesses thrive. That's how we'll get those good manufacturing jobs back, that's how we'll see incomes rising again. A strong economy, with more people working and more businesses investing, that starts right here at home, with American companies and American workers. That's the way we'll do it. You've hit on some very important points there, son. Very important."
" The answer is very straightforward: We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level. China has been cheating over the years -- one, by holding down the value of their currency; number two, by stealing our intellectual property -- our designs, our patents, our technology. There’s even an Apple store in China that's a counterfeit Apple store selling counterfeit goods. They hack into our computers. We will have to have people play on a fair basis. That's number one. Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand a business. That's what brings jobs in. The President’s characterization of my tax plan is -- Property of 7 ","How much time you got, Candy? Governor","The President’s characterization of my tax plan is – frankly, it completely misses the point. My plan isn't about giving handouts to the wealthy; it's about putting more money back into the pockets of working families, it's about incentivizing businesses – small businesses, big businesses – to invest right here in America, to build new factories, to hire American workers. It's about unleashing the entrepreneurial spirit that made this country the envy of the world. We cut taxes, we streamline regulations, and suddenly, those jobs that went overseas? They start coming back home. That's how you level the playing field, folks, not just against China, but for every American trying to get ahead."
 -- is completely -- is completely -- Ms. Crowley: Let me go to the -- Governor Romney: -- is completely false. Let me tell you. Ms. Crowley: Let me go to the President here because we really are -- ,"All right, I’m -- Ms. Crowley: -- because we really are running out of time. And the question is, can we ever get -- we can't get wages like that. It can't be sustained here.","Well, folks, you see what's happening there, right? You just see it. They try to cut you off, they really do. When something is *completely false* – and believe me, often it is, *completely false* – you have to speak up! You can't let them just move on to the next guy, not when the truth is being, let's say, mismanaged. You just can't. You have to set the record straight, and you have to do it quickly. It's about honesty, it's about facts. It's really that simple. You gotta defend yourself against the fake narratives, believe me."
" Thank you, Bob. And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening. Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here. And, Mr. President, it’s good to be with you again. We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it’s nice to maybe be funny this time -- not on purpose. We'll see what happens. This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a complete change in the structure and the environment in the Middle East. With the Arab Spring came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, an opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life and in economic life in the Middle East. But instead we've seen in nation after nation a number of disturbing events. Of course, we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there. We see in Libya, an attack, apparently by -- I think we know now -- by terrorists of some kind against our people there, four people dead. Our hearts and minds go to them. Mali has been taken over -- the northern part of Mali by al Qaeda-type individuals. We have in Egypt a Muslim Brotherhood president. And so what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal of the kind of hopes we had for that region. Of course, the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon. And we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the President has done -- I congratulate him on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al Qaeda. Property of But we can't kill our way out of this mess. We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the world of Islam and other parts of the world reject this radical, violent extremism, which is -- it’s certainly not on the run. It’s certainly not hiding. This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries. And it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism. Mr. Schieffer: Mr. President. ","Well, my first job as Commander-in-Chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe. And that's what we've done over the last four years. We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11. And as a consequence, al Qaeda’s core leadership has been decimated. In addition, we're now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security. And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats. Now, with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm’s way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened; and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice. And that’s exactly what we’re going to do. But I think it’s important to step back and think about what happened in Libya. Now, keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to -- without putting troops on the ground, at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq -- liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years, got rid of a despot who had killed Americans. And, as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans, after the events in Benghazi, marching and saying, “America is our friend. We stand with them.” Now, that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of. And, Governor Romney, I’m glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after al Qaeda, but I have to tell you that your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map, and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East. Property of Governor","Thank you, Bob. And thank you, Governor, for that rather extensive list of challenges facing our nation and the world. It’s good to be with you again, and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss these critical matters with the American people.

Now, the Governor touched on a number of very serious issues, and he’s right, the Middle East is in a period of profound transition. It's a complex region, it always has been, and there are no easy answers. But what we have done, what my administration has done, is to pursue a clear, consistent, and strong strategy to protect American interests and promote our values.

First, on the issue of terrorism: The Governor mentioned Osama bin Laden, and I thank him for acknowledging that achievement. That was a direct result of relentless pressure, intelligence, and courageous action by our special forces. We have decimated Al Qaeda’s core leadership. They are on the run, and they are weaker than they have been in decades. Yes, new threats emerge, and we see radical elements attempting to exploit instability – whether it’s in Mali or elsewhere. But we are working with partners, sharing intelligence, and building capacity to counter these threats, without committing America to open-ended wars.

The situation in Syria is heartbreaking. And we have been clear: Assad must go. We are working with our allies, providing humanitarian aid, strengthening the moderate opposition, and putting economic pressure on the regime to bring about a political transition that respects the rights of all Syrians. This isn't just about military action; it's about diplomacy, economic pressure, and supporting those who seek a better future.

In Libya, let's be clear: the attack on our consulate in Benghazi was an act of terror, and we will bring those responsible to justice. But we acted decisively to support the Libyan people in overthrowing a dictator who threatened his own citizens. We are now working with the new Libyan government to secure their country and build democratic institutions, which is a difficult but vital task.

The Arab Spring did bring hope, and while the path to democracy is never smooth – just look at our own history – it is a path we must support. We are standing with those in Egypt, in Tunisia, who are working to build more inclusive and democratic societies. It's not about choosing a winner or loser, it's about supporting the process of self-determination.

And finally, Iran. The Governor said they are four years closer to a nuclear weapon. Let me be absolutely clear: Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch. We have built an unprecedented international coalition, imposing the toughest sanctions in history on Iran, choking off their revenue, and making it harder for them to pursue their nuclear ambitions. We have kept every option on the table, and we will continue to ensure that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon. This is a red line for the United States, and we are enforcing it.

So, when the Governor talks about a comprehensive and robust strategy, I want the American people to know that we are executing one. It's a strategy that leverages all elements of American power – our diplomacy, our economic strength, our intelligence, and yes, our military when necessary – to secure our nation, protect our allies, and promote stability and democracy in a vital part of the world. It’s a strategy built on American strength and American values, and it is working."
" Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to kill them, to take them out of the picture. But my strategy is broader than that. That’s important, of course. But the key that we’re going to have to pursue is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own. We don’t want another Iraq. We don’t want another Afghanistan. That’s not the right course for us. The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world. And how do we do that? A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the world reject these terrorists. And the answer they came up with was this: One, more economic development. We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment -- and that of our friends -- we should coordinate it to make sure that we push back and give them more economic development. Number two, better education. Number three, gender equality. Number four, the rule of law. We have to help these nations create civil societies. But what’s been happening over the last couple of years is as we’ve watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see al Qaeda rushing in. You see other jihadist groups rushing in. And they’re throughout many nations in the Middle East. It’s wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy. But next door, of course, we have Egypt -- Libya is 6 million population, Egypt 80 million population. We want to make sure that we’re seeing progress throughout the Middle East, with Mali now having North Mali taken over by al Qaeda; with Syria having Assad continuing to kill -- to murder his own people. This is a region in tumult. And of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon -- we’ve got real problems in the region. Mr. Schieffer: Let’s give the President a chance. ","Governor Romney, I’m glad that you recognize that al Qaeda is a threat, because a few months ago, when you were asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia -- not al Qaeda -- you said Russia. And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War has been over for 20 years. But, Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s, and the economic policies of the 1920s. Property of You say that you’re not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq, but just a few weeks ago you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now. And the challenge we have -- I know you haven’t been in a position to actually execute foreign policy, but every time you’ve offered an opinion, you’ve been wrong. You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite the fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction. You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day. You indicated that we shouldn’t be passing nuclear treaties with Russia, despite the fact that 71 senators -- Democrats and Republicans -- voted for it. You’ve said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan; then you said we should; now you say maybe, or it depends -- which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing and sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies. So what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map. And unfortunately, that's the kinds of opinions that you’ve offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength or keeping America safe over the long term. Mr. Schieffer: I’m going to add a couple of minutes here to give you a chance to respond. Governor","Well, look, that's a lot of talk, a lot of very fancy words, but when it comes down to it, my strategy, my strategy, is much simpler. We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan – and believe me, those were disasters, total disasters, mistakes from day one, nobody knows that better than me. We're getting out of these endless wars.

But when it comes to the bad guys, the radical Islamic terrorists, you know what we do? We kill them. We kill them fast, we kill them hard, and we don't have to be talking about 'gender equality' and 'economic development' with a bunch of scholars from the UN, which is, frankly, a total waste of money and time. These guys, they don't care about economic development. They want to kill us. And we have to be tougher.

We need strong leadership. Not this soft stuff. We go after the leaders, absolutely, but we have to do it with overwhelming force. We build up our military, the greatest military in the world, which I did, by the way. And then you hit them, and you hit them hard.

Mali, Syria, Iran with a nuclear weapon? That whole Iran deal, what a disaster, one of the worst deals ever made, and I fixed it, I pulled us out of it. We need to stop financing these countries that don't like us. We're sending them billions and billions, and for what? They turn around and hate us. We have to be smart. We have to be tough.

My strategy is simple: America First. We protect our people. We get rid of the terrorists. We don't spend decades and trillions of dollars trying to build democracies where they don't want them. They need to fix their own problems. We help when it's good for *us*, but we're not going to be nation-building anymore. It's a loser. We win. That's my strategy."
" Well, of course, I don't concur with what the President said about my own record and the things that I’ve said. They don't happen to be accurate. But I can say this -- that we’re talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism we’re seeing and the rising tide of tumult and confusion. And attacking me is not an agenda. Attacking me is not talking about how we’re going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East and take advantage of the opportunity there and stem the tide of this violence. But I’ll respond to a couple of the things you mentioned. First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe, not a -- ",Number one geopolitical -- Governor,"Well, listen, in this job, you get used to folks disagreeing with you, and sometimes they get things plain wrong. That's just part of the rough and tumble. But when you're talking about the Middle East, about the threat of radical terrorism, about the stability of the world, that ain't a game. That's serious business for the American people.

My administration, we understood that threat. We knew you had to stand strong, be clear-eyed, and lead with purpose. And when it comes to Russia, you gotta recognize what they are and deal with them from a position of strength, not weakness.

Attacking someone's record, that's one thing. But ignoring the challenges, or pretending they're not there, that's another. We need leadership that understands the stakes, that protects our freedoms, and that makes clear America stands for liberty around the globe. That's what we did."
" Excuse me. It’s a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face. Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again. Property of I have clear eyes on this. I’m not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr. Putin. And I’m certainly not going to say to him, I’ll give you more flexibility after the election. After the election, he’ll get more backbone. Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed, I believe, that there should have been a status of forces agreement. Did you -- ",That's not true. Governor,"Now look, let me be clear on this. When it comes to the safety and security of the American people, there's no room for doubt or wishful thinking. Iran, absolutely, is a serious threat. A regime that funds terror, that seeks nuclear weapons, that destabilizes the Middle East – we simply cannot stand by and let that happen. We have to confront it with strength, with our allies, and with a clear strategy.

And Russia? Yes, they've been a challenge. They've always looked for openings, whether it's in the U.N. or elsewhere, trying to undermine our interests. You've got to deal with Mr. Putin with your eyes wide open, plain and simple. No 'flexibility' after the election, no 'backbone' that suddenly appears down the road. America needs to be strong *now*, and consistently strong. Our friends need to trust us, and our adversaries need to understand our resolve. That's how you keep the peace and protect American interests around the globe.

As for Iraq, you're right, a Status of Forces Agreement is crucial. When we send our brave men and women into harm's way, we owe them a clear mission and the support they need to secure our interests and protect our gains. Leaving things ambiguous, that just invites more trouble, more instability. We've learned that lesson, and America has to lead with conviction and a steady hand."
" Oh, you didn't -- you didn't want a status of forces agreement? ","No, what I -- what I would not have done is left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down. That certainly would not help us in the Middle East. Governor","Well, look, let me tell you, when you're talking about a Status of Forces Agreement, a SOFA, you're talking about something incredibly complex and, frankly, incredibly vital for our brave men and women in uniform. These aren't just simple handshakes, folks. These are agreements that deal with the legal protections, the operational capabilities, and the overall safety of our American forces on foreign soil.

My job, our job, is to always ensure that our troops are protected, that they can do their job effectively, and that American sovereignty is respected, even when they're operating in another country.

Sometimes, despite your very best efforts – and believe me, we put in the effort, we negotiate hard – the conditions just aren't right. The other side, they might not see things the way we do when it comes to accountability or the legal framework. And you know what? If we can't get a deal that truly protects our soldiers, that respects their mission, and that upholds our national interest, then it's not a deal worth making. We don't sign just to sign. We don't compromise on the safety and dignity of our incredible military.

So, when a SOFA isn't in place, or isn't the *right* SOFA, it's usually because we've made a tough decision to prioritize America's interests and, most importantly, the well-being of our troops. Sometimes, walking away is the strongest hand you've got. And we're always going to put America first. Always."
 I’m sorry. You actually -- there was an effort on the part of the President -- ,You are -- Governor,"I’m sorry. You actually -- there was an effort on the part of the President -- and let me be very clear about this: that effort was entirely focused on securing our borders, strengthening our economy, and ensuring that the American people had the best opportunities possible. We worked hard, believe me. Hard work."
 -- to have a Status of Forces Agreement -- ,He was -- Governor,"...we need to have a Status of Forces Agreement, a *good* one, a *strong* one, to protect our incredible servicemen and women. They're the best in the world, folks, the absolute best, and they put their lives on the line for this country. So when they're overseas, we need to make sure they're protected, fully protected, and not subject to some crazy foreign jurisdiction. It's about American sovereignty, it's about our national interest, and it's frankly just plain common sense. We have to look after our own. Very, very important."
 And I concurred in that and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on. That was something I concurred with -- ,Governor -- Governor,"Absolutely. You know, you *have* to concur with that. You can't just pull out and leave a vacuum, that's a disaster, a total disaster. We had to keep some of our great troops there, the best in the world, to make sure things were done right. To make sure we had leverage.

When you're dealing with these situations, you can't be weak. You send in our incredible people, they do their job, and then you need a presence. A strong presence. It's common sense, frankly. You just can't walk away from it all and expect everything to be perfect. We gotta protect our interests, and we gotta win."
" -- your posture. That was my posture as well. You thought it should have been 5,000 troops. ",Governor -- Governor,"You know, that's absolutely right. You've hit on something essential there, and it's a conversation I had countless times in the Situation Room. My posture, indeed. Because when you talk about numbers like 5,000 troops, you're not just talking about boots on the ground; you're talking about a clear signal. You're talking about a strategic commitment.

For me, that number, or similar numbers, always came down to achieving the mission. It's about protecting American interests, ensuring stability where we need it, and, above all, giving our men and women in uniform the resources and the strength they need to get the job done and come home safe. You have to be decisive, you have to be firm, and you have to make sure your actions match your words. And sometimes, 5,000, or whatever the number, is what's required to project that strength and purpose."
" I thought it should have been more troops. But you know what, the answer was -- ",This is just a few weeks ago. Property of Governor,"I thought it should have been more troops. But you know what, the answer was—the answer was to make the tough call, based on the intelligence we had, and then support our men and women in uniform, no matter what. You gotta lead. You gotta make decisions. And that's what I did. We had a mission, and we executed."
 -- we got no troops through whatsoever. ,This is just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq. Governor,"""No troops through? That's, frankly, totally unacceptable. A total failure. We spend trillions, *trillions* of dollars on our military, the greatest military in the world, and we can't get our people where they need to go? That's weak. Believe me, that wouldn't happen on my watch. We'd have those troops through, and it would be done, and it would be done strongly. Very, very strongly."""
" No, I didn't. I’m sorry, that's -- ",You made a major speech. Governor,"Whoa, whoa, hold on there, partner. No need to get all flustered. Sometimes things ain't always what they seem, right? Let's just clarify what exactly you're talkin' about. That's the important thing."
 I indicated that you -- I indicated that you failed to put in place a status of forces agreement -- ,Governor -- Governor,"Now, hold on just a minute. A Status of Forces Agreement, that's serious business. It's about protecting our servicemen and women, ensuring our operational capabilities, and respecting the sovereignty of our partners. We always understood the importance of getting those right.

To suggest we *failed* to put one in place? I disagree with that characterization. These are often intricate, sensitive negotiations, with a lot of moving parts and, frankly, a lot of different interests at stake. We always worked diligently to secure agreements that served America's national interest and provided the necessary protections for our troops.

Sometimes, the circumstances, the political environment on the ground, or the stance of the host nation, makes an agreement simply not possible, or not possible on terms that are acceptable for the United States. In those situations, a responsible commander-in-chief has to make tough choices, not just chase a headline. We always made those choices with our troops' safety and our national security as the paramount concern."
 -- at the end of the conflict that existed in Iraq. ,"Governor, here’s one thing -- Mr. Schieffer: Let him answer, please.","Well, you're talkin' about a really complex situation there, folks. When we talk about the 'end' of the conflict in Iraq, it's not like flippin' a light switch, is it? It's a process.

Our mission, from the very beginning, was about liberating the Iraqi people from a brutal dictator, removing a threat, and helping them build a free, democratic society. And we *did* that. We helped stand up a new government, we helped them write a constitution, and millions of Iraqis voted for the very first time. That's a powerful thing, freedom.

Now, the road was long, and it was hard. Our brave men and women in uniform, they faced incredible challenges, and they made tremendous sacrifices. We owe them everything. And we always knew that building a stable, free Iraq wouldn't happen overnight. There were going to be enemies of freedom who wanted to stop progress, who wanted to create chaos.

When it came to bringing our troops home, that was always the goal – to transition responsibility to a sovereign Iraqi government capable of securing its own future. And look, there are always going to be bumps in the road, especially in a region as volatile as the Middle East. We saw what happened with ISIS, a brutal new threat that emerged. It just goes to show you that the fight against terror, it doesn't just disappear.

But let's be clear: the Iraqi people have a chance at a different future, a future free from tyranny. And America stood with them. We continue to stand with them, and with all those who seek freedom around the world. We learned hard lessons, but we never stopped believing in the power of liberty to transform lives."
" Well, let’s step back and talk about what’s happening in Syria and how important it is. First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster. Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now, Syria is Iran’s only ally in the Arab world. It’s their route to the sea. It’s the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel. And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us. Number two, seeing a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us. And finally, we don’t want to have military involvement there. We don’t want to get drawn in to a military conflict. And so the right course for us is working through our partners and with our own resources to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a form of, not government, a form of council that can take the lead in Syria, and then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they don’t have arms that get into the wrong hands, that those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with Israel. But the Saudis and the Qatari and the Turks are all very concerned about this. They’re willing to work with us. We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the insurgents there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed are people who will be the responsible parties. Recognize -- I believe that Assad must go. I believe he will go. But I believe we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, such that in the years to come, we see Syria as a friend and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East. This is a critical opportunity for America. And what I’m afraid of is we’ve watched over the past year or so, first the President saying, well, we’ll let the U.N. deal with it and Assad -- excuse me -- Kofi Annan came in and said we’re going to try -- have a ceasefire. That didn’t work. Then it looked to the Russians and said, let’s see if you can do something. We should be playing the leadership role there -- not on the ground with military, but play the leadership role. Mr. Schieffer: All right. Property of ","We are playing the leadership role. We organized the Friends of Syria. We are mobilizing humanitarian support and support for the opposition. And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term. But going back to Libya, because this is an example of how we make choices -- when we went into Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize, we also had to make sure that Muammar Qaddafi didn’t stay there. And to the Governor’s credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized. But when it came time to making sure that Qaddafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle. Imagine if we had pulled out at that point. Muammar Qaddafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden, and so we were going to make sure that we finished the job. That’s part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us. But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with; that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with. And we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria. That’s exactly what we’re doing. Mr. Schieffer: Governor, can I just ask you, would you go beyond what the administration would do? Like, for example, would you put in no-fly zones over Syria? Governor","Well, thank you, Mr. Schieffer. You know, you hit on some very important points there, and frankly, I appreciate the clarity of your thinking.

First off, when you see a dictator murdering his own people, 30,000 innocents, that's not just a statistic, that's a moral outrage. That's a humanitarian disaster, and America, as a beacon of freedom, we cannot stand by and simply watch. We have a responsibility to speak out and to act, and to act decisively, against such evil.

And you're right, Syria isn't just about Syria. This is about the future of the Middle East, it's about freedom, and it's about confronting those who want to do us harm. When you talk about Iran using Syria as a highway to arm Hezbollah, to threaten our friend and ally Israel, well, that's a clear and present danger to regional stability and to our own security interests. We stand with Israel, always.

Assad is a tyrant. He's a menace. He has forfeited his legitimacy, and for the sake of his own people and for the cause of peace in that vital region, Assad must go. And he *will* go. History teaches us that freedom ultimately triumphs over tyranny.

Now, you raise a very important point about not wanting to get dragged into a military conflict. And look, nobody wants to put our brave men and women in uniform in harm's way unnecessarily. We always explore every option. But America *must* lead. When there's a vacuum, bad actors fill it. And we can't outsource our national security or our moral responsibility.

Working with our partners, with Saudi Arabia, with Qatar, with Turkey, with Israel – that's smart power. That's how you build a coalition of the willing. And supporting those responsible parties within Syria, those who want a free and stable future for their country, giving them the means to defend themselves and to take back their country from a brutal regime – that's the right approach. We need to be careful, of course, to ensure those arms don't fall into the wrong hands, but we also can't let fear paralyze us from doing what's right.

This is a critical moment. We can't dilly-dally. We can't just talk. We can't wait for the U.N. or others to solve problems that demand American leadership. We must be clear about our goals, strong in our resolve, and steadfast in our commitment to freedom. This is an opportunity, a real opportunity, for America to stand with the forces of freedom and to reshape that region for the better. And that's what we're going to do."
" I don’t want to have our military involved in Syria. I don’t think there’s a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage. I don’t anticipate that in the future. As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us -- a responsible government, if possible. And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove Assad. But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our troops. And this isn’t going to be necessary. We have -- with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups. Property of 0 But, look, this has been going on for a year. This is a time -- this should have been a time for American leadership. We should have taken a leading role -- not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally -- to bring together the parties there, to find responsible parties. As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the insurgents are highly disparate; they haven’t come together; they haven’t formed a unity group, a council of some kind. That needs to happen. America can help that happen. And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role, which is getting rid of Assad. Mr. Schieffer: Can we get a quick response, Mr. President? Because I want to ask about Egypt. ","I’ll be very quick. What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesn’t have different ideas, and that’s because we’re doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and an effective transition so that we get Assad out. That’s the kind of leadership we’ve shown. That’s the kind of leadership we’ll continue to show. Mr. Schieffer: May I ask you, during the Egyptian turmoil, there came a point when you said it was time for President Mubarak to go.","Mr. Schieffer, absolutely. Look, what I want to make crystal clear is this: America is going to lead, not militarily with boots on the ground, but with all the diplomatic and organizational power we have. We're going to ensure these responsible Syrian groups have the means to defend themselves and, yes, to replace Assad with a government that truly represents the Syrian people and is friendly to our interests. That's the path forward, and we're committed to it."
" No. I believe, as the President indicated, and said at the time that I supported his action there. I felt that -- I wish we would have had a better vision of the future. I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the President’s term and even further back than that, that we would have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn’t explode in the way it did. But once it exploded, I felt the same as the President did, which is these freedom voices in the streets of Egypt were the people who were speaking of our principles. And President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable, and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support. Property of 2 Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly -- because our purpose is to make sure the world is more -- is peaceful. We want a peaceful planet. We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they’re going to have a bright and prosperous future and not be at war. That’s our purpose. And the mantle of leadership for promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America. We didn’t ask for it, but it’s an honor that we have it. But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong, and that begins with a strong economy here at home. And unfortunately, the economy is not stronger. When the President of Iraq -- excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that’s a frightening thing. The former chief of -- the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that -- Admiral Mullen -- said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face. We have weakened our economy. We need a strong economy. We need to have, as well, a strong military. Our military is second to none in the world. We’re blessed with terrific soldiers and extraordinary technology and intelligence. But the idea of a trillion dollars in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that. We need to have strong allies. Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America’s strength. We’re the great nation that has allies -- 42 allies and friends around the world. And finally we have to stand by our principles. And if we’re strong in each of those things, American influence will grow. But, unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America’s influence greater today than it was four years ago. Mr. Schieffer: All right. Governor Romney: And that's because we’ve become weaker -- ","Bob, I think -- Governor","Well, you know, Governor Romney makes some interesting points there. It's always easier to look back with 20/20 hindsight, isn't it? The Arab Spring was a very complex situation, a genuine yearning for freedom that we saw erupt across the region. President Obama, I think, tried to navigate a very difficult path, supporting those democratic aspirations while also trying to maintain some level of stability. It's not a simple choice, and anyone who tells you it is, frankly, isn't fully grasping the nuances involved. We certainly couldn't stand by while leaders brutalized their own people; that's just not who America is, and it's not what we stand for.

And he's absolutely right that America has a unique role to play in promoting peace and stability around the world. It's a responsibility we didn't ask for, but one we've embraced, because a peaceful world is a more prosperous world for everyone, including Americans. That means working with others, building strong coalitions, and leading by example.

Now, when it comes to the economy, you know, it's true we always need to be strong at home. And yes, debt is a serious issue that needs to be addressed responsibly. But let's remember the context. The economy was recovering from a major recession when President Obama took office, and we saw significant job growth and a reduction in unemployment during his tenure. We can always do better, of course, but to say the economy wasn't stronger is to ignore a lot of the progress that was made.

And our military is second to none, that's a testament to the brave men and women who serve. We have to make smart choices about our defense spending, ensuring our forces have what they need without undermining other crucial investments in our future. It's a balance, always a balance.

And he's absolutely right about allies. Our alliances are a cornerstone of our strength. We built those relationships over decades, Republicans and Democrats alike, and they are invaluable for our security and our influence.

But to suggest America's influence wasn't greater four years later? I just don't see it that way. American leadership is about more than just military might; it's about our values, our diplomacy, our economic engagement, and our capacity to bring people together. I think President Obama continued to project American leadership in many crucial ways, even in the face of incredible challenges. It's a tough job, and it requires a steady hand."
" -- on each of those four dimensions. Mr. Schieffer: You’re going to get a chance to respond to that because that's a perfect segue into our next segment, and that is what is America’s role in the world. And that is the question: What do each of you see as our role in the world? And I believe, Governor Romney, it’s your turn to go first. Property of 3 Governor Romney: Well, I absolutely believe that America has a responsibility and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that make the world more peaceful, and those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections -- because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace. They don't vote for war. So we want to promote those principles around the world. We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world. We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible. But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong. America must lead. And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home. You can't have 23 million people struggling to get a job. You can't have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down in its growth rate. You can't have kids coming out of college, half of whom can't find a job today, or a job that's commensurate with their college degree. We have to get our economy going. And our military -- we’ve got to strengthen our military long term. We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road. We make decisions today in a military that will confront challenges we can't imagine. In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance. And a year later, 9/11 happened. So we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military. I will not cut our military budget. We have to also stand by our allies. I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate. I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us. And then of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when the students took the streets in Tehran, and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred. For the President to be silent, I thought was an enormous mistake. We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy. Mr. Schieffer: Mr. President. ","America remains the one indispensible nation, and the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office. Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan. Property of 4 It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade. And, Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger -- in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat. But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America. And that’s what my plan does -- making sure that we’re bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we’re creating jobs here, as we’ve done with the auto industry -- not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas; making sure that we’ve got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. Doing everything we can to control our own energy. We’ve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we’ve developed oil and natural gas, but we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020. That’s the kind of leadership that we need to show. And we’ve got to make sure that we reduce our deficit. Unfortunately, Governor Romney’s plan doesn’t do it. We’ve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don’t need, but also by asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more. That way we can invest in the research and technology that’s always kept us at the cutting edge. Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign. Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies. He’s praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who shows great wisdom and judgment. And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century. Mr. Schieffer: Governor Romney, wrong and reckless policies? Governor","Thank you, Mr. Schieffer. Governor Romney laid out a vision of American leadership, and I agree with him on the fundamental point: America *must* lead. This isn't just about a privilege; it's a responsibility we have, not just to ourselves, but to a world that looks to us for strength, for stability, and for freedom.

But leadership isn't just about saying the right words; it's about making the tough decisions, and it's about having a clear strategy. When it comes to our economy, the Governor is absolutely right. We cannot be strong abroad if we are weak at home. We need to unleash the power of American enterprise, cut the red tape, lower taxes, and let our businesses create jobs. That's how you strengthen America from the inside out. We're talking about real opportunity, real jobs, not just government programs that stifle growth.

And on our military, there's no question. We need the strongest military in the world, period. Not just for today, but for tomorrow and the day after. Because the world is a dangerous place, and if we've learned anything, it's that threats can emerge from anywhere, at any time. We cannot afford to unilaterally disarm or weaken our defenses. We need to invest in our men and women in uniform, give them the best equipment, and make sure they know we have their backs. That's not a budget line item; that's a commitment to our national security.

Now, when it comes to our allies, Governor Romney is right to point out that relationships matter. America's word has to mean something. Our friends need to trust us, and our adversaries need to understand our resolve. And frankly, some of these signals that have been sent around the world, whether it's with our strongest ally in the Middle East, or abandoning commitments in Europe, they send the wrong message. We need consistent, principled leadership that stands with our friends, and confronts our enemies directly, clearly, and without apology.

And finally, on standing for our principles, look, America has always been a beacon of freedom. When people are fighting for their liberty, they look to us. And we have to be there. We have to speak truth to power. We have to support those who want to be free. Because when freedom takes root, it brings peace and stability. When we don't speak up, when we're silent, that's when the forces of oppression get emboldened. America's role isn't just to react to crises; it's to shape the future, to advance liberty, and to do it from a position of undeniable strength."
" I’ve got the policy for a future, an agenda for the future. And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay. And what we’ve seen over the last four years is something I don’t want to see over the next four years. The President said by now we’d be at 5.4 percent unemployment. We’re 9 million jobs short of that. I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I’ll do it with five simple steps. Property of 5 Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence. We’re going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear, and our renewables. Number two, we’re going to increase our trade. Trade grows about 12 percent per year. It doubles about every five or so years. We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America. The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully. As a matter of fact, Latin America’s economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We’re all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us -- time zone, language opportunities. Number three, we’re going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers unions are going to have to go behind. And then we’re going to have to get to a balanced budget. We can’t expect entrepreneurs and businesses, large and small, to take their life savings or their company’s money and invest in America if they think we’re headed to the road to Greece. And that’s where we’re going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge. And I’ll get us on track to a balanced budget. And finally, number five, we’ve got to champion small business. Small businesses are where jobs come from. Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. New business formation is down at the lowest level in 30 years under this administration. I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay. ","Well, let’s talk about what we need to compete. First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses, but, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think, out of 50 states in Massachusetts because the policies that you’re promoting actually don’t help small businesses. And the way you define small businesses include folks at the very top -- they include you and me. That’s not the kind of small business promotion we need. But let’s take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century, and that’s our education policy. We didn’t have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate. Under my leadership, what we’ve done is reformed education, working with governors -- 46 states. Property of 6 We’ve seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time, and they’re starting to finally make progress. And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we’ve fallen behind when it comes to math and science. And those teachers can make a difference. Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn’t going to help the economy grow. When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don’t make a difference. But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference. And if we’ve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that’s what’s going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here. Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we’ve got the most highly skilled workforce. And the kinds of budget proposals that you’ve put forward, when we don’t ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that’s undermining our long-term competitiveness. That is not good for America’s position in the world -- and the world notices. Mr. Schieffer: Let me get back to foreign policy. Governor","Well, listen, that's the kind of plain talk and common-sense economic vision that the American people understand. Getting folks back to work, putting more money in their pockets – that's always been the goal, and that's exactly what we delivered when *we* were in charge. You know, you lay out five steps, and those sound like good, solid American steps.

You talk about North American energy independence? Absolutely. We've got the resources right here, underground and in our ingenuity, to power this nation and keep prices stable. Oil, gas, coal, nuclear, renewables – it's all part of an 'all of the above' strategy that ensures our security and creates good-paying American jobs. You don't get strong without secure energy.

And expanding trade, especially in our own hemisphere? Smart thinking. Latin America represents a tremendous opportunity for American businesses, for our farmers, for our manufacturers. We need to open those markets, ensure fair competition, and build those partnerships that benefit *everyone*.

When it comes to our schools and training our workforce, you're right – it's about putting our kids first, empowering parents, and making sure our folks have the skills for the jobs of tomorrow. And yes, sometimes you have to stand up to those special interests that want to put bureaucracy ahead of our children's future.

And a balanced budget? That's not just good policy, that's responsible stewardship. You can't spend your way to prosperity, and you certainly can't borrow your way to it. We showed that we could cut spending, grow the economy, and put our nation on a sound financial footing. Businesses, entrepreneurs, they need certainty, not the specter of endless debt.

And finally, championing small business – that's where the jobs come from. They're the innovators, the risk-takers, the heart of our communities. We need to cut the red tape, ease the regulatory burden, and unleash the entrepreneurial spirit that made America the greatest economic engine in the world.

So, yeah, these are the kind of pro-growth, pro-American worker policies that deliver results. It's about freedom, responsibility, and opportunity. That's how you get America working again, and that's how you build a stronger future for all."
" Well, look -- Mr. Schieffer: Can I just get back to -- Governor Romney: Well, I need to speak a moment if you’ll let me, Bob -- Mr. Schieffer: : Okay. Governor Romney: -- just about education, because I’m so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of. We have, every two years, tests that look at how well our kids are doing. Fourth-graders and eighth-graders are tested in English and math. While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth-graders came out number one of all 50 states in English and then also in math, and our eighth-graders number one in English and also in math. First time one state had been number one in all four measures. How did we do that? Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom, and that was -- Property of 7 ","Ten years earlier, Governor. Governor","Well, look, Governor Romney makes a powerful point there. When you get Republicans and Democrats focused on the *right* things, like giving our children a quality education, you see results. No doubt about it. Investing in great teachers, setting high standards – that's how you build a future where every child has the chance to succeed. It's about accountability, and it's about empowering our local communities and our states to deliver for our kids. That's good conservative policy, and it's good for America."
 -- and that was what allowed us to become the number-one state in the nation. ,But that was 10 years before you took office. Governor,"...and that was what allowed us to become the number-one state in the nation. The *best* state. Nobody's ever seen anything like it, believe me. We cut the taxes, we got rid of the regulations, we unleashed the power of our incredible people, and we started *winning* again. Tremendous! Just tremendous success."
 And this is -- and we were -- Mr. Schieffer: Gentlemen. Governor Romney: Absolutely -- ,And then you cut education spending when you came into office. Governor,"Well, Bob, I'll tell you what, Governor Romney's absolutely right. He touches on a very important point there, and it's something that we, as Americans, need to keep our eye on. It's about bringing this country together, about economic strength, and about ensuring that every single American has the chance to get ahead. That's what this nation has always been about, and frankly, that's what we've got to deliver for the future. It's not complicated, it's about good, sound principles and working together. By golly."
" The first -- and we kept our schools number one in the nation. They’re still number one today. Mr. Schieffer: All right. Governor Romney: And the principles that we put in place -- we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to be able to compete, but also if they graduated in the top quarter of their class they got a four-year, tuition-free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning. ","That happened before you came into office, though. Mr. Schieffer: Governor -- Governor","Well now, that sounds like a mighty fine plan for the kids, doesn't it? You know, when we talk about education, we're talking about the future of this great nation. And when you set high standards, like those graduation exams to make sure our young people are ready, and then you reward that kind of excellence, that hard work, by giving bright students a tuition-free ride? That's just plain common sense.

That's how you ensure every child has a real shot at reaching their God-given potential. It's about accountability, it's about opportunity, and it's about keeping America strong and competitive in this big, wide world. We gotta keep focusing on what's best for our students, giving them the tools and the incentive to succeed. Sounds like a good start right there."
" That was actually mine. Actually, Mr. President, you’ve got that fact wrong. Mr. Schieffer: Let me just -- I want to try to shift it, because we have heard some of this in the other debates. Governor, you say you want a bigger military, you want a bigger Navy. You don’t want to cut defense spending. What I want to ask you -- we’re talking about financial problems in this country -- where are you going to get the money? Property of 8 Governor Romney: Well, let’s come back and talk about the military, but all the way through. First of all, I’m going through from the very beginning -- we’re going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military. That’s number one, all right? And that’s -- Mr. Schieffer: But can you do this without driving us deeper into debt? Governor Romney: The good news is -- I’ll be happy to have you take a look. Come on our website; you’ll look at how we get to a balanced budget within 8 to 10 years. We do it by getting -- by reducing spending in a whole series of programs. By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare. There are a number of things that sound good, but, frankly, we just can’t afford them, and that one doesn’t sound good and it’s not affordable. So I get rid of that one from day one. To the extent humanly possible, we get that out. We take program after program that we don’t absolutely have to have and we get rid of them. Number two, we take some programs that we are going to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor -- we take that health care program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently. As a governor, I thought, please, give me this program. I can run this more efficiently than the federal government. Mr. Schieffer: Can he do that? Governor Romney: And states, by the way, are proving it. States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these Medicaid dollars, have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively. And so I want to do those two things. It gets us to a balanced budget within 8 to 10 years. ",Bob -- Mr. Schieffer: Let -- Governor,"Well, you know, Governor Romney was talkin' some real common sense there, plain and simple. We gotta get this nation's finances back in order, and for too long, Washington's been spendin' money like it's water, and it's just not right for the American taxpayer.

When he talks about cuttin' that discretionary budget, leavin' the military strong – that's exactly what we need. Our men and women in uniform, they keep us safe, they deserve the best, and you don't mess with that. But these other programs, folks, a lot of 'em are just bloated, inefficient, and frankly, we just can't afford 'em.

And let me tell ya, gettin' rid of Obamacare? That was a disaster from the get-go. Too expensive, too much government, not enough choice. We need healthcare that works for the American people, not for some big government bureaucracy.

And the idea of givin' programs like Medicaid back to the states? Absolutely. Who knows better what people need in their communities, in their states, than the folks on the ground there? Not some faraway bureaucrat in Washington. The states are proving it; they can run these programs far more efficiently, more effectively. It's about empowering the states, empowering the people, and gettin' government off their backs. That's how you balance a budget; that's how you strengthen this great nation. We gotta make tough choices, but they're the right choices for our future."
" Let’s get back to the military, though. Mr. Schieffer: Well, that’s what I’m trying to find out about. Property of 9 ","He should have answered the first question. Look, Governor Romney has called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he’s going to pay for by closing deductions. Now, the math doesn’t work, but he continues to claim that he’s going to do it. He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for. Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I’ve been in office. We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined -- China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it -- next 10. And what I did was work with our Joint Chiefs of Staff to think about what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe, and that’s the budget that we’ve put forward. But what you can’t do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for; $5 trillion on tax cuts. You say that you’re going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions without naming what those loopholes and deductions are, and then somehow you’re also going to deal with the deficit that we’ve already got. The math simply doesn’t work. But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not just budgets. We’ve got think about capabilities. We need to be thinking about cybersecurity. We need to be thinking about space. That's exactly what our budget does, but it’s driven by strategy. It’s not driven by politics. It’s not driven by members of Congress and what they would like to see. It’s driven by what are we going to need to keep the American people safe. That's exactly what our budget does. And it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern, because we’ve got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas. Governor","Well, Bob, when it comes to the military, let me just say this: The men and women who serve this nation are the finest in the world. And we're making sure they have every single tool, every resource, to do the job we ask them to do. Now, 'Property of 9,' that's part of the comprehensive planning, the detailed work that goes on behind the scenes to keep our nation secure. It's about making sure our strategies are sound, our equipment is top-notch, and our troops are ready for any challenge. We've got a lot of smart people working on these things, Bob, making sure we're always looking out for the security of the American people."
" Bob, I’m pleased that I’ve balanced budgets. I was in the world of business for 25 years. You didn't balance your budget, you went out of business. I went to the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance and made a success there. I had the chance to be governor of our state; four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget. We cut taxes 19 times, balanced our budget. The President hasn’t balanced a budget yet. I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself. I’m going to be able to balance the budget. Let’s talk about military spending, and that's this -- our Navy -- Property of 0 Mr. Schieffer: Thirty seconds. Governor Romney: Our Navy is old -- excuse me, our Navy is smaller now than any time since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission; we’re now down to 285. We’re headed down to the low 200s if we go through with sequestration. That's unacceptable to me. I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy. Our Air Force is older and smaller than any time since it was founded in 1947. We’ve changed for the first time since FDR -- since FDR, we had the -- we’ve always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once. Now we’re changing to one conflict. Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people. And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is the combination of the budget cuts the President has, as well as the sequestration cuts. That, in my view, is making our future less certain and less secure -- ","Bob, I just need to comment on this. First of all, the sequester is not something that I proposed. It’s something that Congress has proposed. It will not happen. The budget that we’re talking about is not reducing our military spending, it’s maintaining it. But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn’t spent enough time looking at how our military works. You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military has changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. And so the question is not a game of Battleship where we’re counting ships; it’s what are our capabilities. And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home. And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you’re putting forward, because it just doesn’t work. And we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesn’t work. Property of 1 Mr. Schieffer: A lot to cover. I’d like to move to the next segment: Red lines -- Israel and Iran. Would either of you -- and you’ll have two minutes -- and, President Obama, you have the first go at this one. Would either of you be willing to declare that an attack on Israel is an attack on the United States -- which, of course, is the same promise that we give to our close allies like Japan. And if you made such a declaration, would not that deter Iran? It’s certainly deterred the Soviet Union for a long, long time when we made that promise to our allies. Mr. President.","Alright, you talk about balancing budgets, and that's *tremendous*, that's really great, okay? But look, under *my* administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. The best. Nobody's ever done what we did. We cut taxes more than anyone, we got rid of the regulations that were killing business, and we had jobs, jobs, jobs. So when you have an economy like that, folks, you're bringing in the revenue, and you don't have these problems. It's very simple. It's called being smart, and having the best people.

And the military, you're right, you are absolutely right. What they did to our military was a disgrace. A total disgrace. We had old planes, old ships, everything was old, it was all sad! And I rebuilt it. I rebuilt our military to a level never seen before. Brand new equipment, the best equipment, the strongest military in the world. Nobody's going to mess with us, believe me. You can't cut a trillion dollars from our defense and expect to be safe. It's ridiculous. It's a joke. We want peace through strength, and we're going to have it. That's the highest responsibility, like you say, and we're doing it, and we're doing it better than anyone."
" Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the President made, which is that if I’m President of the United States -- when I’m President of the United States, we will stand with Israel. And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily. That’s number one. Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran -- there’s no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America. It presents a threat not only to our friends, but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us. It’s also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means. And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago -- when I was in Israel speaking at the Herzliya conference, I laid out seven steps. Crippling sanctions were number one and they do work. You’re seeing it right now in the economy. It’s absolutely the right thing to do to have crippling sanctions. I’d have put them in place earlier, but it’s good that we have them. Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions. I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil can’t come into our ports. I imagine the EU would agree with us as well. Not only ships couldn’t, I’d say companies that are moving their oil can’t; people who are trading in their oil can’t. I would tighten those sanctions further. Secondly, I’d take on diplomatic isolation efforts. I’d make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the genocide convention. His words amount to genocide in citation. I would indict him for it. I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world -- the same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa. We need to increase pressure time and time again on Iran because anything other than a solution to this which says -- which stops this nuclear folly of theirs is unacceptable to America. And of course, a military action is the last resort. It is something one would only -- only consider if all of the other avenues had been tried to their full extent. Property of 3 Mr. Schieffer: Let me ask both of you, there are -- as you know, there are reports that Iran and the United States as part of an international group have agreed in principle to talks about Iran’s nuclear program. What is the deal -- if there are such talks, what is the deal that you would accept? Mr. President. ","Well, first of all, those are reports in the newspaper. They are not true. But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place -- because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations. And we would welcome that. There are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life. And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision. But the deal we’ll accept is they end their nuclear program. It’s very straightforward. And I’m glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we’re taking. There have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign where it sounded like you thought that you’d do the same things we did, but you’d say them louder and somehow that would make a difference. And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking. It’s meticulous. We started from the day we got into office. And the reason it was so important -- and this is a testament to how we’ve restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China, because if it’s just us that are imposing sanctions, we’ve had sanctions in place for a long time. It’s because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure. And we’ve got to maintain that pressure. There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established; they convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program; there are inspections that are very intrusive, but over time what they can do is regain credibility. In the meantime, though, we’re not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place. Property of 4 And one last thing, just to make this point -- the clock is ticking. We’re not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere. And I’ve been very clear to them. Because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program. And that clock is ticking. Mr. Schieffer: All right.","Well, thank you, Bob. And let me tell you, when you're talking about Iran and the security of our allies, you're talking about issues that keep any American President up at night. The remarks made just now underscored some bedrock truths that I believe transcend partisan lines.

Now, as for talks and what kind of deal *I* would accept regarding Iran's nuclear program – let me be clear as a bell on this point. My top priority, my non-negotiable bottom line, is this: **Iran will not, under any circumstances, be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon, or even the capacity to quickly build one.** Period. That is paramount for the security of the United States, for our cherished ally Israel, and for the peace and stability of the entire region.

So, if we were to engage in talks, any agreement would have to meet very stringent conditions.

First, it would demand **absolute, unfettered transparency and intrusive, verifiable inspections** – not just announced visits, but anywhere, anytime access for international inspectors to every single facility, declared or undeclared, and to the personnel involved in their nuclear program. We can't take their word for it; we need to *see* it, without a shadow of a doubt.

Second, any deal would have to include **significant, permanent limitations on their enrichment capabilities, their centrifuges, and their ballistic missile development that could be used to deliver a nuclear warhead.** This isn't about temporary freezes or short-term delays. This is about dismantling their pathways to a bomb, completely and irreversibly, for the long haul.

And third, Bob, those talks would need to be conducted from a position of undeniable strength. Our **crippling sanctions would remain firmly in place, and indeed, would be tightened further, until Iran demonstrates a credible, irreversible commitment to non-proliferation.** Diplomacy, yes, but only when backed by unwavering pressure. A deal isn't a reward for talking; it's a consequence of concrete, verifiable actions by Iran to abandon their nuclear ambitions.

So, what's the deal? The deal is simple: **Iran disarms its nuclear ambitions, fully and verifiably, and adheres to international norms. Anything less than that, anything that leaves us vulnerable to a nuclear Iran, is simply not a deal that America, under my leadership, would accept.** We'll always pursue peace, but we'll always protect our interests with strength and resolve."
" I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we’ve had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be. I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength. And I say that because from the very beginning, the President, in his campaign some four years ago, said he’d meet with all the world’s worst actors in his first year. He’d sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and with President Ahmadinejad of Iran. And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States. And then the President began what I’ve called an apology tour of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America. I think they looked at that and saw weakness. Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the President was silent. I think they noticed that as well. And I think that when the President said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well. All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we’re just going to keep on spinning centrifuges. Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world. That’s unacceptable for us. Property of 5 And it’s essential for a President to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable. And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us. They must not develop nuclear capability. And the way to make sure they understand that is by having from the very beginning the tightest sanctions possible. They need to be tightened. Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher. We need to indict Ahmadinejad. We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won’t have to take the military action. ","Bob, let me just respond. Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing. This has been probably the biggest whopper that’s been told during the course of this campaign. And every fact-checker and every reporter who’s looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true. And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we’ve put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever. And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector. So I’ll let the American people decide, judge who is going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions. And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian Revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for. And so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we’ve been able to mobilize the world. When I came into office, the world was divided; Iran was resurgent. Iran is at its weakest point economically, strategically, militarily, than in many years. And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon. That’s in America’s national interest, and that will be the case so long as I’m President. Governor","You know, you hit the nail right on the head. Absolutely right. It’s a total disaster, what we've seen unfold with Iran, frankly. A complete lack of strength, from the very beginning. And when America looks weak, when the world sees a leader going on an 'apology tour,' criticizing our own country, or staying silent when dissidents are crying out for freedom in the streets of Tehran... Believe me, the mullahs, they notice. They don't respect that. They see an opening, and they take it.

When an American President says he'll meet with the worst actors without preconditions, they don't see it as an honor, no. They see it as weakness. They see someone desperate, someone who doesn't understand leverage. And when you create 'daylight' between us and our greatest ally, Israel, you're not making friends, you're creating enemies and emboldening the wrong people. It's just bad policy. Very, very bad.

They absolutely spun those centrifuges faster and faster, exactly like you said. Ten thousand centrifuges! They're marching towards a nuclear weapon, and why? Because they weren't put in their place. Because previous administrations weren't tough enough, didn't understand how to negotiate, and frankly, didn't love this country enough to protect it properly. They just made stupid deals – terrible deals – that gave Iran billions of dollars. Billions! For nothing!

What we need, and what I always delivered, is strength. Maximum pressure. The toughest sanctions, economic isolation, and making it unequivocally clear: a nuclear Iran is never, ever acceptable. We don't just talk about it, we *do* it. We show them American strength. Because if you don't show that strength from day one, if you don't draw those clear lines, you end up exactly where we are now. And believe me, that's a very dangerous place for America and for the world. It’s not complicated, folks. It's about being tough, being smart, and putting America first."
" We’re four years closer to a nuclear Iran. We’re four years closer to a nuclear Iran. And we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they’ve continued to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer. That’s number one. Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq, and -- and, by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations. Property of 6 And, by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel. And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive. You said that on occasion America has dictated to other nations. Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations. We have freed other nations from dictator. ","Bob, let me respond. If we’re going to talk about trips that we’ve taken - - when I was a candidate for office, the first trip I took was to visit our troops. And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn’t take donors, I didn’t attend fundraisers. I went to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable. And then I went down to the border town of Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining down from Hamas. And I saw families there who showed me where missiles had come down near their children’s bedrooms, and I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids -- which is why, as President, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles. So that’s how I’ve used my travels, when I traveled to Israel and when I traveled to the region. And the central question at this point is going to be who’s going to be credible to all parties involved. And they can look at my track record -- whether it’s Iran’s sanctions, whether it’s dealing with counterterrorism, whether it’s supporting democracy, whether it’s supporting women’s rights, whether it’s supporting religious minorities -- and they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history. And that kind of credibility is precisely why we’ve been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now. Mr. Schieffer: What if the Prime Minister of Israel called you on the phone and said, “Our bombers are on the way. We’re going to bomb Iran” -- what do you say? Governor","Let me tell you, what we're talking about here is an absolute disaster, folks. An absolute, total disaster. Four years closer to a nuclear Iran? That's not just a mistake, that's a failure of monumental proportions. We had them, we had them cornered, and then *they* let them get closer. Unbelievable! You don't waste four years when it comes to national security, not with a regime like Iran. This puts America, and frankly, the entire world, in tremendous danger. It's just bad. Very, very bad.

And an ""apology tour""? You know, that's exactly what it was. An apology tour! You fly all over the Middle East, you bow, you apologize for America? America doesn't apologize! We don't apologize for being the greatest country in the history of the world. We don't apologize for fighting for freedom, for liberating nations from dictators, for standing up for what's right. That's what we do! We're the good guys!

And then you skip Israel? Our closest friend, our most reliable ally in the region? A true democracy, a truly special country. And you just *skip* them? Believe me, they noticed. Everyone noticed. It sends a terrible message, a weak message. You stand with your friends, you don't abandon them. It's just common sense, folks.

And to say America has dictated to other nations, to bash our own country on foreign soil? We haven't dictated. We've *led*. We've *freed* nations. We've sacrificed blood and treasure to bring stability and protect freedom. To say otherwise, to denigrate our own nation like that, it's a disgrace. It shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what America stands for. A complete and total lack of respect for our own history and our own incredible people. It's sad!"
" Bob, let’s not go into hypotheticals of that nature. Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the Prime Minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way or their fighters are on the way. This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of last minute -- Mr. Schieffer: So you’re saying -- Governor Romney: I’m just saying that’s just not -- Property of 7 Mr. Schieffer: Okay, well, let’s see what -- Governor Romney: Let’s come back to what the President was speaking about, which is what’s happening in the world, and the President’s statement that things are going so well. Look, I look at what’s happening around the world and I see Iran four years closer to a bomb. I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult. I see jihadists continuing to spread -- whether they’re rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure but it’s clear they’re there. They’re very strong. I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead. Assad is still in power. I see our trade deficit with China larger than it’s -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact. I look around the world and I don’t feel that -- you see North Korea continuing to export their nuclear technology. Russia has said they’re not going to follow Nunn-Lugar anymore. They’re -- back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them. I look around the world -- I don’t see our influence growing around the world. I see our influence receding -- in part because of the failure of the President to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the turmoil with Israel. I mean, the President received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying that tensions with Israel were a real problem. They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the damage in his own party. ","All right, Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues -- whether it’s the Middle East, whether it’s Afghanistan, whether it’s Iraq, whether it’s now Iran -- you’ve been all over the map. I mean, I’m pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program. But just a few years ago, you said that’s something you’d never do. In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan; now you’re for it, although it depends. In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there. The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Qaddafi. When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any President would make that call. But when you were a candidate in 2008 -- as I was -- and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights, I would take that shot, you said we shouldn’t move heaven and earth to get one man. Property of 8 You said we should ask Pakistan for permission. And if we had asked Pakistan for permission, we would not have gotten it [him]. And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him After we killed bin Laden, I was at Ground Zero for a memorial and talked to a young woman who was four years old when 9/11 happened. And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the Twin Towers, saying, “Peyton, I love you, and I will always watch over you.” And for the next decade she was haunted by that conversation. And she said to me, “By finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me.” And when we do things like that, when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world, and it tells Peyton that we did not forget her father. Mr. Schieffer: All right.","Well, Bob, look, Governor Romney, he's just talking, he's just talking. He had his chance, right? He lost. And he's going on and on about problems. But when *I* was president, believe me, we had a different world. A much better world.

He talks about Iran, four years closer to a bomb. Let me tell you, when I was there, we crippled them. We had sanctions like nobody's ever seen. They were weak, on their knees, begging to talk. Not like what's happening now.

Middle East? Rising violence, chaos? We got historic peace deals done, the Abraham Accords, nobody else could do that. Nobody even thought it was possible! We had the Middle East getting straightened out, because they knew *I* was in charge. They respected me.

Jihadists, spreading? We hit them hard. We got rid of ISIS, 100% gone. That wasn't easy, that was tough.

Syria, Assad still in power? We were tough on Assad. But we were getting out of these endless wars, bringing our troops home, and still making sure America was strong.

Trade deficit with China? He's right about that, it's a disaster. But when *I* was president, we put massive tariffs on China. They were paying us billions and billions of dollars. We were making them pay. We were making great deals for America. Nobody else did that.

North Korea? They stopped testing when I was dealing with them. We had a relationship. It was a good relationship. Russia? Putin respected me. He didn't mess around when I was there. He knew who he was dealing with.

And US influence receding? That's what happens when you don't have a strong leader. When I was president, America was respected again. Globally. They respected us. We rebuilt our military, the greatest military in the world. We had the biggest budget ever.

And Israel? The president received a letter... Oh, please. Nobody, and I mean nobody, was better for Israel than me. We moved the embassy to Jerusalem, a historic move, something nobody else had the guts to do. We recognized the Golan Heights. The relationship was fantastic. Best ever. These Democrat senators, they don't know what they're talking about.

So, Governor Romney, he's good at listing problems, but he wasn't good at solving them. We solved them. We had America First, and America was winning. That's the difference."
" Bob -- Mr. Schieffer: Governor, you get to go first here. Governor Romney: You can’t -- okay, but you can’t have the President just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond. Mr. Schieffer: Well, with respect, sir, you had laid out quite a program there. Governor Romney: Well, that's probably true. Mr. Schieffer: And we’ll give you -- we’ll give you -- ","We’ll agree -- Property of 9 Mr. Schieffer: We’ll catch up. The United States is scheduled to turn over responsibility for security in Afghanistan to the Afghan government in 2014. At that point we will withdraw our combat troops, leave a smaller force of Americans -- if I understand our policy -- in Afghanistan for training purposes. It seems to me the key question here is what do you do if the deadline arrives and it is obvious the Afghans are unable to handle their security? Do we still leave? And I believe, Governor Romney, you go first. Governor","Mr. Schieffer: And we’ll give you -- we’ll give you --
Bush (leaning into the microphone, a slight, knowing grin): Now, Bob, with all due respect to my opponent, and I've got plenty of respect for him, we can't spend all our time just talking about who gets to talk next. The American people, they're looking for solutions, for a way to get this economy moving, for security at home and abroad. I laid out a plan that *works*. Now, let's talk about *that*. Let's talk about what's really going to help folks get back on their feet. Not just a lot of squabbling. We got serious business to do."
" Well, we’re going to be finished by 2014. And when I’m President, we’ll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014. The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so. We’ve seen progress over the last several years. The surge has been successful, and the training program is proceeding apace. There are a large number of Afghan security forces -- 350,000 -- that are ready to step in to provide security, and we’re going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014. So our troops will come home at that point. I can tell you at the same time that we will make sure that we look at what’s happening in Pakistan and recognize that what’s happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan. And I say that because I know a lot of people just feel like we should brush our hands and walk away -- and I don't mean you, Mr. President -- but some people in our nation feel that Pakistan isn’t being nice to us and that we should just walk away from them. Pakistan is important to the region, to the world, and to us, because Pakistan has a hundred nuclear warheads, and they're rushing to build a lot more. They’ll have more than Great Britain sometime in the relatively near future. They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country. And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us. And so we’re going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild a relationship with us. And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met. So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014. Mr. Schieffer: Mr. President. Property of 0 ","When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq, and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade. We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan. And we did deliver a surge of troops. That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq. And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place. Part of what had happened is we had forgotten why we had gone. We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths. And so we decimated al Qaeda’s core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We then started to build up Afghan forces, and we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there’s no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country. That transition has to take place in a responsible fashion. We’ve been there a long time, but we’ve got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need. But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war, it’s time to do some nation-building here at home. And what we can now do is free up some resources to, for example, put Americans back to work -- especially our veterans -- rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools; making sure that our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury; making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place. I was having lunch with some -- a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances. When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch. And what we’ve said is let’s change those certifications. The First Lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces, putting our veterans back to work. And as a consequence, veterans’ unemployment is actually now lower than the general population; it was higher when I came into office. So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we’re making that transition in Afghanistan. Mr. Schieffer: All right, let me go to Governor Romney, because you talked about Pakistan and what needs to be done there. General Allen, our commander in Afghanistan, says that Americans continue to die at the hands of groups who are supported by Pakistan. Property of 1 We know that Pakistan has arrested the doctor who helped us catch Obama [sic] -- bin Laden. It still provides safe haven for terrorists. Yet we continue to give Pakistan billions of dollars. Is it time for us to divorce Pakistan? Governor","*(Leaning forward slightly, a serious, yet determined expression)*

Well, Mr. Schieffer, I understand the desire to bring our troops home, and every American President feels that in their bones. Our men and women in uniform, and their families, have made immense sacrifices for our freedom and security, and we owe them a debt of gratitude.

The mission in Afghanistan, as you know, began for a very clear reason: to confront those who attacked us on 9/11 and ensure that Afghanistan would never again be a safe haven for terrorists. We went in there to dismantle al-Qaeda, and we've made significant progress in that fight, disrupting their networks and bringing justice to those who would do us harm.

Now, when you talk about 2014 and bringing our troops home, that's a goal we all share. But it's critical that we ensure the job is done right. We can't just wish away the challenges. We have to make certain that Afghanistan truly *can* stand on its own two feet, that its security forces are capable, and that the gains we've made in freedom and stability are not lost. Because if Afghanistan falls back into chaos, or becomes a launching pad for terror again, that would be a profound danger to our own national security. We can't afford to take our eye off that ball.

And you're absolutely right about Pakistan. It's a complicated relationship, no doubt about it. We've got to work with them. They're a vital partner in the region, and a nuclear-armed one, in a very tough neighborhood. We need a stable Pakistan, one that's committed to fighting terror within its own borders and preventing its territory from being used by the Haqqani Network or any other extremists. That relationship requires constant attention, and it requires both firmness and cooperation. We have to be clear about our expectations.

So, while the goal of bringing our troops home is laudable, we must always keep our eye on the bigger picture: protecting the American people and ensuring that we leave behind a stable situation, not one that could come back to haunt us down the road. It's about victory, not just withdrawal."
" No, it’s not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point; a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation -- as I indicated before, the Taliban, the Haqqani Network. It’s a nation that’s not like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there. You’ve got the ISI, their intelligence organization, that’s probably the most powerful of three branches there. Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government. This is a nation which, if it falls apart, if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there, and you’ve got terrorists there who could grab their hands onto those nuclear weapons. This is an important part of the world for us. Pakistan is technically an ally, and they’re not acting very much like an ally right now, but we have some work to do. And I don’t blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained. We had to go into Pakistan. We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden. That was the right thing to do. And that upset them, but there was obviously a great deal of anger even before that. But we’re going to have to work with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they’re on. It’s important for them. It’s important for the nuclear weapons. It’s important for the success of Afghanistan, because inside Pakistan you have a large -- Pashtuns that are Taliban. They’re going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go, and that’s one of the reasons the Afghan security forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that. But it’s important for us to recognize that we can’t just walk away from Pakistan. But we do need to make sure that as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society. Mr. Schieffer: Let me ask you, Governor -- because we know President Obama’s position on this -- what is your position on the use of drones? Property of 2 Governor Romney: Well, I believe that we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world. And it’s widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that entirely, and feel the President was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it to continue to go after the people who represent a threat to this nation and to our friends. Let me also note that, as I said earlier, we’re going to have to do more than just going after leaders and killing bad guys, important as that is. We’re also going to have to have a far more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism. We haven’t done that yet. We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the record -- you look at the record of the last four years and say, is Iran closer to a bomb? Yes. Is the Middle East in tumult? Yes. Is al Qaeda on the run, on its heels? No. Are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement? No, they haven’t had talks in two years. We have not seen the progress we need to have. And I’m convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands. ","Well, keep in mind, our strategy wasn’t just going after bin Laden. We’ve created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism -- in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan. And what we’ve also done is engage these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people’s lives day to day -- to make sure that their governments aren’t corrupt; to make sure that they are treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown; and to make sure that they’ve got a free market system that works. So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries, and we’ve stood on the side of democracy. One thing I think Americans should be proud of -- when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any other country. In Egypt, we stood on the side of democracy. In Libya, we stood on the side of the people. And as a consequence, there’s no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed. But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States, and we want to shrink those groups and those networks, and we can do that. But we’re always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities. Property of 3 The truth, though, is that al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office, and they don’t have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago. Mr. Schieffer: Let’s go to the next segment, because it’s a very important one. It is the rise of China and future challenges for America. I want to just begin this by asking both of you -- and, Mr. President, you go first this time -- what do you believe is the greatest future threat to the national security of this country?","Well now, listen, folks. When you're talking about a nation like Pakistan, you're talking about a situation that demands serious, clear-eyed leadership. This isn't some ordinary country. This is a nation with a nuclear arsenal, and it's got real problems, deep problems, with radical elements like the Taliban and the Haqqani Network operating within its borders. That's a powder keg, plain and simple, and the last thing we need is for those nuclear materials to fall into the wrong hands. That's a scenario that frankly keeps a President up at night.

Now, Pakistan has been a partner in some ways, an ally in name. But sometimes, partners need a firm hand, and they need to be reminded of their responsibilities. Our relationship has been strained, sure, and some of that goes back to the tough decisions we've had to make to protect American lives, like going in to get Osama bin Laden. That was the right thing to do, a necessary act to defend our nation, and we'll always do what's necessary to keep America safe.

We cannot, and we will not, just walk away from Pakistan. That would be irresponsible. We have to engage, we have to work with them, and we have to push them towards a more stable, more responsible path. Our support, and let me be clear on this, must be tied to them making real progress towards a civil society, towards cracking down on those who harbor terrorists. It's in their interest, and it's absolutely in America's vital national security interest.

And when it comes to drones, and taking out those who plot against us, those who wish to do harm to American citizens and our allies? My position is, and has always been, that we must use every tool in our arsenal to protect our nation. If there are terrorists plotting to attack us, hiding in some remote area, then we have a solemn duty to track them down and eliminate that threat, using whatever means necessary. This technology is a critical component in our ongoing fight against radical extremism, and we will continue to deploy it effectively and judiciously to protect our homeland and our interests abroad.

But make no mistake, taking out the bad guys is a necessary step, but it's not the whole strategy. We need a comprehensive, overarching strategy that doesn't just chase terrorists, but confronts the ideology that fuels them. We need to promote freedom, we need to empower those who seek a better way, and we need strong, decisive American leadership to rally the world. Because when America leads with conviction, when we have a clear strategy, we can achieve peace and security in a dangerous world. We haven't always seen that kind of consistent, decisive progress, and it's time we did."
" Well, first of all, it’s not government that makes business successful. It’s not government investments that make businesses grow and hire people. Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran. Let’s talk about China. China has an interest that’s very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world. They don’t want war. They don’t want to see protectionism. They don’t want to see the world break out into various form of chaos, because they have to manufacture goods and put people to work. They have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year, coming into the cities, needing jobs. So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open. And so we can be a partner with China. We don’t have to be an adversary in any way, shape, or form. We can work with them. We can collaborate with them if they're willing to be responsible. Now, they look at us and say, is it a good idea to be with America? How strong are we going to be? How strong is our economy? They look at the fact that we owe them a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including them. They look at our decision to cut back on our military capabilities -- a trillion dollars. The Secretary of Defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. It’s not my term. It’s the President’s own Secretary of Defense called them devastating. They look at America’s commitments around the world and they see what’s happening, and they say, well, okay, is America going to be strong? And the answer is, yes, if I’m President, America will be very strong. We’ll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us. I’ve watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency; it holds down the prices of their goods. It means our goods aren’t as competitive, and we lose jobs. That's got to end. They're making some progress. They need to make more. That's why on day one I will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs. They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods. They have to understand we want to trade with them, we want a world that's stable, we like free enterprise, but you’ve got to play by the rules. Property of 5 Mr. Schieffer: Well, Governor, let me just ask you, if you declare them a currency manipulator on day one, some people say you’re just going to start a trade war with China on day one. Is that -- isn’t there a risk that that could happen? Governor Romney: Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year. So it’s pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war. And there’s one going on right now which we don't know about -- it’s a silent one, and they're winning. We have enormous trade imbalance with China. And it’s worse this year than last year. And it’s worst last year than the year before. And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out. We have to say to our friends in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively, we understand it, but this can't keep on going. You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world -- even into the United States. I was with one company that makes valves in process industries. And they said, look, we were having some valves coming in that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty. And we looked them up, and they had our serial number on them, and then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number. There were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging. These were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor. This can't go on. I want a great relationship with China. China can be our partner, but that doesn't mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis. ","Well, Governor Romney is right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas. And that's your right. I mean, that's how our free market works. But I’ve made a different bet on American workers. If we had taken your advice, Governor Romney, about our auto industry, we’d be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China. If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax code so that companies that are in profits overseas don’t pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes, that’s estimated to create 800,000 jobs. The problem is they won’t be here; they’ll be in places like China. Property of 6 And if we’re not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the lead in things like clean energy technology. Now, with respect to what we’ve done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office to China. And, actually, currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993. We absolutely have to make more progress, and that’s why we’re going to keep on pressing. And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future. And we believe China can be a partner, but we’re also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power, that we are going to have a presence there. We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through, that commerce continues. And we’re organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards. That’s the kind of leadership we’ve shown in the region. That’s the kind of leadership that we’ll continue to show. Governor","Well, now, listen. Governor Romney, he's talking about a lot of things that are true, very true. But he's talking about *what he would do*. I *did* it. I mean, nobody, *nobody* was tougher on China than me. And he's right, they were taking advantage of us for many, many years, decades even. He talks about them not playing by the rules, holding down their currency, stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, hacking into our computers – it's a disaster. And you know what? He saw it, but nobody did anything about it until I came along.

He says he'd label them a currency manipulator on day one? Folks, we did that! I had the Treasury Department do it. And he's talking about tariffs? We put massive tariffs on China. Nobody thought it could be done. Everyone said, ""Oh, you'll start a trade war!"" Well, guess what? The trade war was already happening, and *they* were winning! A silent one, he says? That's right, and they were ripping us off blind. We lost millions of jobs because of that. Factories shut down, cities devastated. It was a disgrace.

And the trade imbalance? Huge! He's talking about ""this much stuff"" and ""that much stuff."" It was horrible. We were losing, big league. I changed that. We got them to the table, and we made a historic trade deal, the greatest trade deal ever made, before the China Virus came over from China, of course.

He talks about a strong military. Believe me, we rebuilt our military, bigger and better than ever before. We spent trillions of dollars. Not like the previous administrations that let it go to waste. And Iran, a nuclear Iran? A tremendous threat. We were very, very tough on Iran, let me tell you.

Romney had some good ideas, he saw the problems, but he didn't have the courage, the strength, the stamina to do what was necessary. I did. We put America First. We brought jobs back. And we showed China that they can't just walk all over us anymore. It's about respect. They have to respect us, and they didn't, until I became President. It's very simple."
" I just want to take one of those points. Again, attacking me is not talking about an agenda for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country. But the President mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere. Nothing could be further from the truth. I’m a son of Detroit. I was born in Detroit. My dad was head of a car company. I like American cars, and I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry. My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks. It was President Bush that wrote the first checks. I disagreed with that. I said they need -- these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy. And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they’d built up. And fortunately, the President -- ","Governor Romney, that’s not what you said. Property of 7 Governor","Now look, when I was in the Oval Office, we faced a real crisis. The auto industry, it wasn't just *an* industry; it was a cornerstone of American manufacturing, with millions of jobs tied to it, not just in Detroit, but all across this great country. We had folks working hard, supporting their families, and they were staring down the barrel of unemployment.

When you're President, you've got to make tough decisions. And sometimes, those decisions aren't popular, but they're necessary to keep our economy from going off a cliff and to protect good, honest jobs. My job, my solemn duty, was to stabilize the economy, and that meant making sure those companies had a chance to survive, to restructure, and to come back strong. We put a bridge loan in place, knowing full well that hard decisions would still need to be made by the companies themselves, but we couldn't just stand by and watch an entire sector collapse and take millions of jobs with it. That wouldn't have been responsible leadership for the American people."
" Fortunately, the President -- you can take a look at the op-ed. You can take a look at the op-ed. ","Governor Romney, you did not say that you would provide governor help. Governor","Look, I've seen a lot of op-eds. And when they talk about the President, meaning me, believe me, it's either going to be tremendous praise, because we're doing an incredible job, or it's going to be totally fake news, dishonest, written by some failed writer who hates our country. The people know the truth, okay? They see the results. We're winning. That's what you need to look at, not some little op-ed."
" You know, I’m still speaking. I said that we would provide guarantees, and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy. Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet. And the idea that has been suggested, that I would liquidate the industry -- of course not, of course not. ",Let’s check the record. Governor,"Of course not! Look, when I tell the American people something, I mean it. We're talking about folks' jobs, their livelihoods here. You don't just stand by and watch good American companies, good American workers, go under if you can do something about it. My job, first and foremost, is to protect this country and ensure prosperity for everybody.

And sometimes, that means stepping in, providing a bridge, to get these industries through a tough patch. We've done it before, we'll do it again if we have to. It's about getting back on our feet, strong and ready to compete, not tearing anything down. That's just common sense, folks. And that's exactly what we did."
 That’s the height of silliness. I have never said I would -- ,Let’s check the record. Governor,"That’s the height of silliness. I have never said I would *do such a thing. It's a complete fabrication, folks. A total lie, made up by the fake news and the radical left. They make up these crazy stories, they put them out there, and frankly, it's a disgrace. I never said it. Never. Believe me!*"
 -- liquidate the industry. I want to keep the industry going and thriving. ,"Governor, the people of Detroit don’t forget. Governor","Liquidate the industry? No, no, no. That's a terrible idea, a very bad idea. Some people, they just don't understand how critical these industries are for our country, for our incredible workers.

Believe me, we are not going to liquidate anything. We're going to do the exact opposite. We're going to build it up, make it stronger than ever before. We're going to keep the industry going, absolutely, and not just going, but thriving, prospering, creating tremendous jobs right here in America. That's what we do. We build, we don't liquidate."
" And that’s why I have the kind of commitment to make sure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful. We in this country can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we’re going to. We’re going to have to have a President, however, that doesn’t think that somehow the government investing in car companies like Tessella and Fisker, making electric battery cars -- this is not research, Mr. President. These are the government investing in companies, investing in Solyndra. This is a company -- this isn’t basic research. I want to invest in research. Research is great. Providing funding to universities and think tanks -- great. But investing in companies -- absolutely not. That’s the wrong way to go. ","Governor, the fact of the matter is -- Property of 8 Governor","You are absolutely right, my friend, and you hit on a critical point for the future of our economy and the strength of our nation.

We believe in American ingenuity. We believe in the hardest working people in the world, the innovators, the entrepreneurs, the risk-takers right here in the United States of America. And they can compete with anyone, anywhere, if you just let them do what they do best.

Now, the government's role, as I see it, is not to be a venture capitalist. It's not to pick winners and losers in the marketplace. That's a recipe for waste, it's a recipe for favoritism, and frankly, it's a recipe for failure. We saw it with Solyndra, didn't we? Millions of taxpayer dollars, just gone. That's not how you strengthen an economy.

What we *should* be doing, and what we *will* do, is create the best possible environment for *all* businesses to thrive. That means smart regulation, not stifling regulation. It means a fair tax system that encourages investment, not punishes success. And yes, it means supporting groundbreaking research, foundational research, the kind that happens in our universities and our national labs, that creates the bedrock for future industries. But then, you step back. You let the American private sector, with its unmatched drive and innovation, take those ideas and turn them into jobs, into products, into prosperity.

That's the American way. That's how we ensure our industries aren't just competing, but are leading the world for generations to come."
" I’m still speaking. So I want to make sure that we make America more competitive and that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow. But your investing in companies doesn’t do that. In fact, it makes it less likely for them to come here, because the private sector is not going to invest in a solar company -- ","Governor, I’m happy to respond. You’ve held the floor for a while. Governor","Look, I hear you, and it's a very fair point. A lot of people, a lot of very smart people, worry about government getting too involved, picking winners and losers. And frankly, sometimes, it's a disaster. A total disaster.

What we need to do is make America the best place in the world for business, period. Not by having bureaucrats in Washington tell a solar company, or any company, how to do business. No! We do it by cutting taxes, getting rid of these ridiculous regulations – you wouldn't believe how many there are, it's unbelievable – and making sure American companies, American workers, are always, always, put first.

When you do that, when you make it easier, when you make it cheaper, when you unleash the power of American innovation... believe me, the private sector, the great entrepreneurs, they're going to flock here. They're going to build the factories, they're going to create the jobs, and they're going to make America stronger than ever before. We don't need government hand-holding for specific companies; we need a fair playing field and a government that lets our incredible businesses do what they do best. That's how you win. That's how you make America great again."
 -- if you’re investing government money in someone else’s. ,"Look, I think anybody out there can check the record. Governor Romney, you keep on trying to airbrush history here. You were very clear that you would not provide government assistance to the U.S. auto companies even if they went through bankruptcy. You said that they could get it in the private marketplace. That wasn’t true. They would have gone through -- Governor","...*venture*, well, then you have a sacred duty to the American taxpayer to make sure every single dime is accounted for, that it serves the public good, and isn't just a handout to a favored few. Because remember, folks, it's not the government's money; it's *your* money. And we ought to treat it with the respect and diligence it deserves."
" You’re wrong. You’re wrong, Mr. President. ","No, I am not wrong. Governor","Well, now, I understand you feel very strongly about that, and I respect your right to express your opinion. But let me tell you, when you look at the facts, when you really consider the long-term impact of what we're doing here for the American people, I believe you'll find that our approach isn't just right, it's the *only* way forward if we want to build a better future. We've thought this through very, very carefully."
 You’re wrong. ,I am not wrong. Governor,"Wrong? You call that wrong? Believe me, we're not wrong about anything! We're doing things, tremendous things, that nobody else could ever do. The economy is booming, we're making America strong again, and folks are seeing results like never before. Some people just don't want to admit it, or maybe they just don't understand how successful we're being.

But we're right, folks. We're right, and the American people know it. The numbers are speaking for themselves. Believe me!"
 People can look it up -- you’re right. ,People will look it up. Governor,"That's right. Folks can look it up, and they'll see the truth of it. Always good to have the facts."
 Good. ,"But more importantly, it is true that in order for us to be competitive, we’re going to have to make some smart choices right now. Cutting our education budget -- that’s not a smart choice. That will not help us compete with China. Cutting our investments in research and technology -- that’s not a smart choice. That will not help us compete with China. Bringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have -- that is not going to make us more competitive. Property of 9 Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now. Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States -- that will not make us more competitive. And the one thing that I’m absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw a drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we’ve now begun to make some real progress. What we can’t do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place. And that’s why we have to move forward and not go back. Governor","Good. Very good. Tremendous, in fact. We're doing incredible things, the best things, and people are starting to see it, believe me. We're winning."
" I couldn’t agree more about going forward, but I certainly don’t want to go back to the policies of the last four years. The policies of the last four years has seen incomes in America decline every year for middle-income families, now down $4,300 during your term. Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job. When you came to office, 32 million people on food stamps; today, 47 million people on food stamps. When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt; now $16 trillion in debt. It hasn’t worked. You said by now we’d be at 5.4 percent unemployment. We’re 9 million jobs short of that. I’ve met some of those people. I met them in Appleton, Wisconsin. I met a young woman in Philadelphia who’s coming out of college, can't find work. Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work. It’s just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours that these last four years have been so hard. And that's why it’s so critical that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy. And that's not going to happen by just hiring teachers. Look, I’d love to -- I love teachers, and I’m happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that. By the way, I don't like to have the federal government start pushing its way deeper and deeper into our schools; let the states and localities do that. I was a governor -- the federal government didn't hire our teachers. Mr. Schieffer: Governor. Governor Romney: But I love teachers, but I want to get our private sector growing, and I know how to do it. Property of 0 Mr. Schieffer: I think we all love teachers. Gentlemen, thank you so much for a very vigorous debate. We have come to the end. It is time for closing statements. I believe you’re first, Mr. President. ","Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University. You’ve now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials. And now you’ve got a choice. Over the last four years, we’ve made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits, and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies -- a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless; economic policies that won’t create jobs, won't reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don't have to play by the same rules that you do. And I’ve got a different vision for America. I want to build on our strengths. And I’ve put forward a plan to make sure that we’re bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas. I want to make sure we’ve got the best education system in the world, and we’re retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas, but also the energy sources of the future. Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need, but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st-century economy. As Commander-in-Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops, and go after those who would do us harm. But after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we’ve got to do some nation-building here at home rebuilding our roads, our bridges, and especially caring for our veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom. We’ve been through tough times, but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together. And if I have the privilege of being your President for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices, I will fight for your families, and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on Earth. Thank you. Property of 1 Mr. Schieffer: Governor. Governor","Well, Bob, Governor, thank you for a very spirited discussion tonight. And to the American people watching at home, I want to speak directly to you.

I understand the frustrations, I truly do. I've traveled this country, just like the Governor, and I've sat with families in their living rooms, in their kitchens, at their workplaces. I've looked into the eyes of folks who are still struggling to find work, to make ends meet, to give their kids a better life. And let me be clear: as your President, that keeps me awake at night.

We came into office in some of the toughest economic times this nation has seen in generations. We inherited a deep recession, a crisis that was sending tremors through our financial system and shaking the very foundations of the American dream. And yes, it has been a long, hard climb out of that hole. We've had to make tough choices, and we've put in place policies to stop the freefall and start creating jobs again.

Are we where we want to be? No, not yet. But let's look at the direction we're heading. We've seen an incredible rebound in the private sector, millions of jobs created, and a manufacturing sector that's coming back home to America. We've invested in our infrastructure, in clean energy, in the very foundations of a 21st-century economy, because we know that's how we build a strong, sustainable future, not just for some, but for all Americans.

And when it comes to education, Governor, I agree completely. We love our teachers. And we know that investing in our schools, making sure every child has a shot at a quality education, that's not federal overreach; that's fundamental to our nation's competitiveness. It's about empowering our communities and our states to give our kids the best possible start.

My plan for the next four years is about building on this progress. It's about bringing down the deficit in a responsible way, it's about continuing to support our small businesses, investing in research and development, and making sure that every single American who wants to work has the skills and the opportunity to do so. It's about strengthening the middle class and expanding opportunity for everyone, because that's when America truly thrives.

We are a resilient people. We are a hopeful people. And I believe in the American people, in their capacity to innovate, to work hard, and to build a better future. We've come too far to turn back now. Let's keep moving forward, together, to write the next great chapter of the American story. Thank you, and God bless America."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Can you assure the American people that there have been no breaches of national security or classified information in the scandal involving Generals Petraeus and Allen? And do you think that you as Commander-in-Chief and the American people should have been told that the CIA chief was under investigation before the election? ","Well, I have no evidence at this point from what I've seen that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security. Obviously there’s an ongoing investigation. I don't want to comment on the specifics of the investigation. The FBI has its own protocols in terms of how they proceed, and I'm going to let Director Mueller and others examine those protocols and make some statements to the public generally. I do want to emphasize what I’ve said before: General Petraeus had an extraordinary career. He served this country with great distinction in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and as head of the CIA. By his own assessment, he did not meet the standards that he felt were necessary as the Director of CIA with respect to this personal matter that he is now dealing with, with his family and with his wife. And it’s on that basis that he tendered his resignation, and it’s on that basis that I accepted it. But I want to emphasize that from my perspective at least, he has provided this country an extraordinary service. We are safer because of the work that Dave Petraeus has done. And my main hope right now is, is that he and his family are able to move on and that this ends up being a single side note on what has otherwise been an extraordinary career.","Thank you. This is a serious matter, and I appreciate you asking about it, because the security of our nation is always the most important thing on my mind, and on the minds of the American people.

First, let me be very clear: National security is not a game. It is the solemn duty of everyone in government, especially those at the highest levels of our intelligence agencies and our military. When it comes to individuals like Generals Petraeus and Allen, and any investigation involving classified information, I want to assure every American that our intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice conduct thorough reviews. They are charged with protecting our secrets, and they take that responsibility seriously. If there were any breaches of classified information, or any actions that compromised our national security, those matters would be investigated fully and dealt with justly. We have strong systems in place for this, and we rely on the integrity of those processes to protect our country.

Now, on the question of whether the Commander-in-Chief and the American people should be informed of an investigation involving the CIA chief before an election... Let me put it this way: The President of the United States, as Commander-in-Chief, needs to have all the relevant information to make sound decisions for the country. When a senior official, particularly one in such a critical national security role as the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, is under investigation, that is information the President absolutely needs to know. It affects trust, it affects operations, and it affects our ability to secure the nation.

As for the American people, they deserve transparency, especially in matters of such high importance. However, there's a delicate balance to strike between transparency and the integrity of an ongoing investigation. You don't want to politicize an inquiry, and you don't want to jeopardize its effectiveness. But the principle is clear: our leaders must be held to the highest standards, and the public has a right to know about matters that fundamentally impact our national security and the leadership of our intelligence agencies, especially when trust is involved."
 What about voters? Did they deserve to know? ,"Again, I think you’re going to have to talk to the FBI in terms of what their general protocols are when it comes to what started off as a potential criminal investigation. One of the challenges here is, is that we’re not supposed to meddle in criminal investigations, and that’s been our practice. And I think that there are certain procedures that both the FBI follow, or DOJ follow, when they’re involved in these investigations. That’s traditionally been how we view things, in part because people are innocent until proven guilty, and we want to make sure that we don’t pre-judge these kinds of situations. And so my expectation is, is that they followed protocols that they already established. Jessica Yellin. Where’s Jessica?","Oh, absolutely, the voters. Look, in a democracy, the ultimate power rests with the people, right? And for them to exercise that power responsibly, to make informed choices about who represents them, about the direction of the country, they simply *have* to know what's going on. That's fundamental.

Now, you know, running a government, there are always going to be situations where you have to balance that transparency with, say, national security interests, or protecting an ongoing investigation, or even the privacy of individuals. It's a constant balancing act. But the principle, the guiding star, is always that the American people, the voters, deserve to be treated with respect, and that means being as open and honest with them as humanly possible."
" Mr. President, on the fiscal cliff, two years ago, sir, you said that you wouldn’t extend the Bush-era tax cuts, but at the end of the day, you did. So, respectfully, sir, why should the American people and the Republicans believe that you won’t cave again this time? ","Well, two years ago, the economy was in a different situation. We were still very much in the early parts of recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And ultimately, we came together not only to extend the Bush tax cuts, but also a wide range of policies that were going to be good for the economy at that point -- unemployment insurance extensions, payroll tax extension -- all of which made a difference, and is part of the reason why what we've seen now is 32 consecutive months of job growth and over 5.5 million jobs created and the unemployment rate coming down. But what I said at the time is what I meant, which is this was a one-time proposition. And what I have told leaders privately as well as publicly is that we cannot afford to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. What we can do is make sure that middle-class taxes don’t go up. And so the most important step we can take right now -- I think the foundation for a deal that helps the economy, creates jobs, gives consumers certainty, which means gives businesses confidence that they're going to have consumers during the holiday season -- is if we right away say 98 percent of Americans are not going to see their taxes go up; 97 percent of small businesses are not going to see their taxes go up. If we get that in place, we are actually removing half of the fiscal cliff. Half of the danger to our economy is removed by that single step. And what we can then do is shape a process whereby we look at tax reform -- which I'm very eager to do. I think we can simplify our tax system. I think we can make it more efficient. We can eliminate loopholes and deductions that have a distorting effect on our economy. I believe that we have to continue to take a serious look at how we reform our entitlements, because health care costs continue to be the biggest driver of our deficits. So there is a package to be shaped, and I'm confident that parties -- folks of goodwill in both parties can make that happen. But what I'm not going to do is to extend Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent that we can't afford, and according to economists, will have the least positive impact on our economy.","Alright, let's set the record straight on that, because the narrative often gets twisted. Two years ago, we were staring down a barrel at a manufactured crisis—a 'fiscal cliff' designed by gridlock, not sound policy. My commitment then, and my commitment now, has always been to the American people and the strength of our economy.

When I said we wouldn't just *blindly* extend those tax cuts, I meant we needed real solutions, not just kicking the can down the road. But the reality was, facing an immediate, massive tax hike on every American, a shock to our economy, that wasn't leadership; that was recklessness. We made a strategic decision, a *responsible* decision, to prevent economic collapse and provide certainty, buying us time to fight for the permanent, pro-growth reforms this nation truly deserves. That wasn't caving, that was protecting American jobs and family budgets.

Now, why should you believe me *this time*? Because I've proven I'll make the tough calls, and I'll stand firm for what's right. We've seen what happens when Washington plays games. This time, we're not just averting a crisis; we're building a future. My plan is clear: lower taxes for working families, unleash American businesses, and rein in reckless spending. I've got the resolve, I've got the plan, and I'm not going to let political games get in the way of delivering for the American people. We're going to get it done."
 You've said that the wealthiest must pay more. Would closing loopholes instead of raising rates for them satisfy you? ,"I think that there are loopholes that can be closed, and we should look at how we can make the process of deductions, the filing process easier, simpler. But when it comes to the top 2 percent, what I’m not going to do is to extend further a tax cut for folks who don’t need it, which would cost close to a trillion dollars. And it’s very difficult to see how you make up that trillion dollars -- if we’re serious about deficit reduction -- just by closing loopholes and deductions. The math tends not to work. And I think it’s important to establish a basic principle that was debated extensively during the course of this campaign. I mean, this shouldn’t be a surprise to anybody. If there was one thing that everybody understood was a big difference between myself and Mr. Romney, it was when it comes to how we reduce our deficit, I argued for a balanced, responsible approach, and part of that included making sure that the wealthiest Americans pay a little bit more. I think every voter out there understood that that was an important debate, and the majority of voters agreed with me. By the way, more voters agreed with me on this issue than voted for me. So we’ve got a clear majority of the American people who recognize if we’re going to be serious about deficit reduction, we’ve got to do it in a balanced way. The only question now is are we going to hold the middle class hostage in order to go ahead and let that happen? Or can we all step back and say, here’s something we agree on -- we don’t want middle-class taxes to go up. Let’s go ahead and lock that in. That will be good for the economy. It will be good for consumers. It will be good for businesses. It takes the edge off the fiscal cliff. And let’s also then commit ourselves to the broader package of deficit reduction that includes entitlement changes and it includes potentially tax reform, as well as I’m willing to look at additional work that we can do on the discretionary spending side. So I want a big deal. I want a comprehensive deal. I want to see if we can, at least for the foreseeable future, provide certainty to businesses and the American people so that we can focus on job growth, so that we’re also investing in the things that we need. But right now what I want to make sure of is that taxes on middle-class families don’t go up. And there’s a very easy way to do that. We could get that done by next week. Lori Montenegro, Telemundo.","Well now, that's a real good question, and it gets right to the heart of what we mean by fairness and shared responsibility in this country.

You know, when I talk about ensuring the wealthiest pay more, it's not just about some arbitrary number on a tax rate. It's about making sure everyone plays by the same rules. It's about ensuring that the tax code isn't rigged in favor of those who can afford the best accountants and lawyers, leaving the middle class and working families to carry a disproportionate share of the burden.

Closing those loopholes? Absolutely. That's not just a good idea, that's common sense, and it would be a very strong and welcome step in the right direction. When folks are using complicated schemes to avoid paying their fair share, that's revenue that could be going to strengthen our schools, rebuild our infrastructure, reduce the national debt, or invest in the future of our children.

So, would it satisfy me? It would certainly go a long, long way toward building a more equitable and fair system, where hard work is rewarded and everyone contributes to the common good. It's about making sure we have a tax system that works for all Americans, not just the few at the very top. And that, my friends, is something we should always strive for."
" Thank you, Mr. President. On immigration reform, the criticism in the past has been that you did not put forth legislation with specific ideas and send it up to the Hill. This time around you have said again that this will be one of the top priorities for a second term. Will you then send legislation to the Hill? And exactly what do you envision is broad immigration reform? Does that include a legalization program? And also, what lessons, if any, did Democrats learn from this last election and the Latino vote? ","Well, I think what was incredibly encouraging was to see a significant increase in Latino turnout. It is the fastest-growing group in the country. And historically what you’ve seen is the Latino vote, vote at lower rates than the broader population, and that's beginning to change. You're starting to see a sense of empowerment and civic participation that I think is going to be powerful and good for the country. And it is why I’m very confident that we can get immigration reform done. Before the election I had given a couple interviews where I predicted that the Latino vote was going to be strong, and that that would cause some reflection on the part of Republicans about their position on immigration reform. I think we’re starting to see that already. I think that's a positive sign. This has not historically been a partisan issue -- we’ve had President Bush and John McCain and others who have supported comprehensive immigration reform in the past. So we need to seize the moment. And my expectation is, is that we get a bill introduced and we begin the process in Congress very soon after my inauguration. And in fact, some conversations I think are already beginning to take place among senators and congressmen and my staff about what would this look like. And when I say comprehensive immigration reform, it is very similar to the outlines of previous efforts at comprehensive immigration reform. I think it should include a continuation of the strong border security measures that we’ve taken because we have to secure our borders. I think it should contain serious penalties for companies that are purposely hiring undocumented workers and taking advantage of them. And I do think that there should be a pathway for legal status for those who are living in this country, are not engaged in criminal activity, are here simply to work. It’s important for them to pay back-taxes. It’s important for them to learn English. It’s important for them to potentially pay a fine. But to give them the avenue whereby they can resolve their legal status here in this country I think is very important. Obviously, making sure that we put into law what the first step that we’ve taken administratively dealing with the DREAM Act kids is very important as well. One thing that I’m very clear about is that young people who are brought here through no fault of their own, who have gone to school here, pledged allegiance to our flag, want to serve in our military, want to go to school and contribute to our society, that they shouldn’t be under the cloud of deportation, that we should give them every opportunity to earn their citizenship. And so there are other components to it, obviously. The business community continues to be concerned about getting enough high-skill workers, and I am a believer that if you’ve got a PhD in physics or computer science who wants to stay here and start a business here, we shouldn’t make it harder for him to stay here; we should try to encourage him to contribute to this society. I think that the agricultural sector obviously has very specific concerns about making sure that they’ve got a workforce that helps deliver food to our tables. So there are going to be a bunch of components to it, but I think whatever process we have needs to make sure our border security is strong, needs to deal with employers effectively, needs to provide a pathway for the undocumented here, needs to deal with the DREAM Act kids. And I think that’s something that we can get done. Chuck Todd. Where’s Chuck?","Thank you very much. That's a very important question, and frankly, a tremendous one. You're absolutely right, immigration is going to be a top, top priority for the second term, because frankly, it's a disaster right now under the current regime. A total disaster, an invasion.

Now, you talk about past criticisms – look, nobody has ever done more for border security than I have. We built large sections of the wall, we had the strongest border in history. But the other side, they came in and just opened it all up. It's a catastrophe.

So, will I send legislation to the Hill? Absolutely. And believe me, it will be comprehensive, it will be strong, and it will be common sense. Unlike what you've seen before, this will be legislation designed to *actually secure our country*, not just talk about it. We're not going to play games with this.

What do I envision for broad immigration reform? It's very simple, actually.
First, and most importantly, is **border security**. Period. We will finish the wall, we will surge resources, we will implement state-of-the-art technology, and we will make sure that nobody, and I mean nobody, just walks into our country illegally. It's unfair to those who follow the rules, and it's dangerous for our nation.
Second, we're going to move to a **merit-based system**. We want people who are going to come here, contribute, and truly love our country. We want the best and the brightest, not just whoever shows up.
And third, we will deal with **interior enforcement**. We have laws, and they need to be enforced throughout the country.

Now, regarding a legalization program – you mean amnesty? Look, that's a very big word. We are a nation of laws. What we are going to do is secure the border first. When the border is truly secure, and we have control, *then* we can discuss different pathways for people who have been here a long time, but always with the understanding that they must respect our laws and our sovereignty. But it will not be an open invitation for more illegal immigration. That's what the radical left wants, and that's not what the American people want.

And what did the Democrats learn from the last election and the Latino vote? Honestly? I don't think they've learned a thing. They keep pushing for open borders, for policies that hurt American workers, and they think they own the Latino vote. But they don't. Many, many patriotic Latinos are seeing what's happening. They want safe communities, they want strong jobs, they want a secure border just like everyone else. They see the mess the Democrats have made, and they're coming over to our side. They're smart people, and they understand that my policies, our policies, are what's best for families and for the country. They're leaving the Democrats in droves, and you saw that in the last election, and you'll see it even more this time. Believe me."
" Mr. President, I just want to follow on both Ben’s question and Jessica’s question. On having to do with Ben’s question -- ","How about Lori’s question? Do you want to follow up on that one, too?","Alright, thank you for that. I appreciate you tying back to Ben's and Jessica's questions, it's always good to build on what's been discussed. Please, proceed with your specific follow-up."
" No, I feel like you answered that one completely. Are you withholding judgment on whether you should have known sooner that there was a potential -- that there was an investigation into whether your CIA Director -- potentially there was a national security breach with your CIA Director -- do you believe you should have known sooner? Are you withholding judgment until the investigation is complete on that front? And then the follow-up to Jessica’s question -- tax rates. Are you -- is there no deal at the end of the year if tax rates for the top 2 percent aren’t the Clinton tax rates, period? No ifs, ands, or buts -- any room in negotiating on that specific aspect of the fiscal cliff? ","I am withholding judgment with respect to how the entire process surrounding General Petraeus came up. We don’t have all the information yet, but I want to say that I have a lot of confidence generally in the FBI, and they’ve got a difficult job. And so I’m going to wait and see to see if there’s any other --","Alright, let's take these one at a time, and I appreciate you pressing on these important issues.

First, on the matter of national security and the ongoing investigation into the CIA Director: Look, when you're talking about national security, you're talking about the very safety of the American people, and there's nothing more serious than that. We have an ongoing investigation, and it is absolutely crucial that we let the process play out. You don't jump to conclusions, and you don't speculate when the facts are still being gathered. That's just common sense. My job is to protect this country, and I have confidence in the professionals who are working diligently to get to the bottom of this. We will have a full understanding of the situation once that investigation is complete, and *then* we can make informed judgments. Until then, my focus is on ensuring our national security apparatus is strong and effective.

Now, regarding the economy and these tax rates, and the so-called ""fiscal cliff"": My position has been clear, and it remains clear. We need a tax system that encourages investment, that creates jobs, and that keeps America competitive in a global economy. Raising taxes on our job creators, on small businesses, on the folks who are driving this economy – that's not the way forward. We've seen what happens when you stifle growth with higher taxes. It just doesn't work.

So, when you ask if there's no deal unless we hit those Clinton-era rates on the top 2 percent, period? My answer is this: We need a deal that's good for the American people, and a deal that puts our economy on a stronger footing. Raising taxes on the very people we need to be investing and expanding isn't a sound principle for growth. I am always open to serious negotiations, and I believe we can find common ground, but we're not going to sacrifice economic growth simply to raise taxes on a segment of our population that is already paying a significant share. We need to be smart, we need to be responsible, and we need to prioritize jobs and economic expansion for *all* Americans."
 -- that you should have known? Do you think in hindsight -- ,"Well, I mean, Chuck, what I’ll say is, is that if -- it is also possible that had we been told, then you’d be sitting here asking a question about why were you interfering in a criminal investigation. So I think it’s best right now for us to just see how this whole process unfolded. With respect to the tax rates, I just want to emphasize I am open to new ideas. If Republican counterparts or some Democrats have a great idea for us to raise revenue, maintain progressivity, make sure the middle class isn’t getting hit, reduces our deficit, encourages growth, I’m not going to just slam the door in their face. I want to hear ideas from everybody.","Well, look, that's the thing about hindsight, isn't it? It's always a perfect lens. When you're in the Oval Office, or any leadership position for that matter, you're making decisions based on the best information you've got at the time. You've got intelligence, economic projections, counsel from smart people, folks telling you what they *think* is going to happen.

The fact is, we always tried to do the right thing, to look out for the American people, to advance our interests and our values around the world. But the world is a complex, interconnected place, and sometimes, despite your best efforts, things unfold in ways you couldn't have fully foreseen.

Are there things, looking back, that I wish we had understood more deeply, or consequences that played out differently than we hoped? Absolutely. You learn lessons every day, and if you're not learning, you're not growing. Whether it's the long-term ripple effects of economic policy, or the shifting sands of geopolitics, or even just the pace of technological change.

You know, you do the best you can with what's in front of you. You don't have a crystal ball. But you always hope that what you learn helps the next generation of leaders make even better choices."
 -- red line. ,"Look, I believe this is solvable. I think that fair-minded people can come to an agreement that does not cause the economy to go back into recession, that protects middle-class families, that focuses on jobs and growth, and reduces our deficit. I’m confident it can be done. My budget, frankly, does it. I understand that -- I don’t expect the Republicans simply to adopt my budget. That’s not realistic. So I recognize that we're going to have to compromise. And as I said on Election Night, compromise is hard, and not everybody gets 100 percent of what they want and not everybody is going to be perfectly happy. But what I will not do is to have a process that is vague, that says we're going to sort of, kind of, raise revenue through dynamic scoring or closing loopholes that have not been identified. And the reason I won't do that is because I don’t want to find ourselves in a position six months from now or a year from now where, lo and behold, the only way to close the deficit is to sock it to middle-class families, or to burden families that have disabled kids or have a parent in a nursing home, or suddenly we've got to cut more out of our basic research budget that is the key to growing the economy in the long term. So that’s my concern. I'm less concerned about red lines, per se. What I'm concerned about is not finding ourselves in a situation where the wealthy aren't paying more or aren't paying as much as they should, middle-class families one way or another are making up the difference -- that’s the kind of status quo that has been going on here too long, and that’s exactly what I argued against during this campaign. And if there’s one thing that I'm pretty confident about is the American people understood what they were getting when they gave me this incredible privilege of being in office for another four years. They want compromise. They want action. But they also want to make sure that middle-class folks aren't bearing the entire burden and sacrifice when it comes to some of these big challenges. They expect that folks at the top are doing their fair share as well. And that’s going to be my guiding principle during these negotiations, but, more importantly, during the next four years of my administration. Nancy Cordes.","A red line? Well, when America puts a red line out there, folks, it's not a suggestion. It's a statement. It's a clear boundary, and you can be darn sure that if anyone — anyone — decides to cross it, there will be consequences. We don't draw lines lightly. We do it to protect our interests, our allies, and the very values we stand for. And we've always been prepared to back up our words with action. Always."
" Mr. President, on Election Night, you said that you were looking forward to speaking with Governor Romney, sitting down in the coming weeks to discuss ways that you could work together on this nation's problems. Have you extended that invitation? Has he accepted? And in what ways do you think you can work together? ","We haven't scheduled something yet. I think everybody forgets that the election was only a week ago and -- I know I've forgotten. I forgot on Wednesday. So I think everybody needs to catch their breath. I'm sure that Governor Romney is spending some time with his family. And my hope is, before the end of the year, though, that we have a chance to sit down and talk. There are certain aspects of Governor Romney’s record and his ideas that I think could be very helpful.","Well, you know, that's exactly right. On Election Night, I spoke directly to the American people, and I made it clear that the campaign is over, and now it's time to govern. And that means working together, finding common ground, and focusing on the serious challenges this nation faces.

So, yes, absolutely. The invitation has been extended, and I had a good, productive conversation with Governor Romney just a couple of days ago. He's indicated a real willingness to sit down and talk, and we're working out the details on the schedule as we speak. I'm very much looking forward to that meeting in the coming weeks.

You know, Governor Romney is a serious man, and he cares deeply about this country. He's had a remarkable career, from leading a successful business, to turning around the Olympics, to serving as Governor of Massachusetts. He's got a lot of experience and a lot of good ideas.

My belief is that when good people who love this country sit down, roll up their sleeves, and put the national interest first, you can always find a way forward. We talked about a number of areas where I believe we can find common ground: strengthening our economy, making sure everyone has a fair shot at opportunity, continuing to lead in the world. I'm interested in his perspective on how we can create more jobs, how we can foster innovation, and how we can make sure our kids are getting the best education possible. These are big issues, and they're not Republican issues or Democrat issues – they're American issues.

I'm confident that by working together, we can deliver real results for the American people. That's what they expect, and that's what they deserve."
 Such as? ,"Well, to give you one example, I do think he did a terrific job running the Olympics. And that skill set of trying to figure out how do we make something work better applies to the federal government. There are a lot of ideas that I don’t think are partisan ideas but are just smart ideas about how can we make the federal government more customer friendly; how can we make sure that we’re consolidating programs that are duplicative; how can we eliminate additional waste. He presented some ideas during the course of the campaign that I actually agree with. So it would be interesting to talk to him about something like that. There may be ideas that he has with respect to jobs and growth that can help middle-class families that I want to hear. So I’m not either prejudging what he’s interested in doing, nor am I suggesting I’ve got some specific assignment. But what I want to do is to get ideas from him and see if there are some ways that we can potentially work together.","Well, such as... strengthening our economy for every American, ensuring our national security is absolutely paramount, or tackling crucial domestic issues like healthcare reform. You know, the big challenges that truly define a presidency and impact the American people. That's what we focus on."
" But when it comes to your relationships with Congress, one of the most frequent criticisms we’ve heard over the past few years from members on both sides is that you haven’t done enough to reach out and build relationships. Are there concrete ways that you plan to approach your relationships with Congress in a second term? ","Look, I think there’s no doubt that I can always do better, and so I will examine ways that I can make sure to communicate my desire to work with everybody, so long as it’s advancing the cause of strengthening our middle class and improving our economy. I’ve got a lot of good relationships with folks both in the House and the Senate. I have a lot of relationships on both sides of the aisle. It hasn’t always manifested itself in the kind of agreements that I’d like to see between Democrats and Republicans. And so I think all of us have responsibilities to see if there are things that we can improve on. And I don’t exempt myself from needing to do some self-reflection and see if I can improve our working relationship. There are probably going to be still some very sharp differences. And as I said during the campaign, there are going to be times where there are fights, and I think those are fights that need to be had. But what I think the American people don’t want to see is a focus on the next election instead of a focus on them. And I don’t have another election. And Michelle and I were talking last night about what an incredible honor and privilege it is to be put in this position. And there are people all across this country, millions of folks, who worked so hard to help us get elected, but there are also millions of people who may not have voted for us but are also counting on us. And we take that responsibility very seriously. I take that responsibility very seriously. And I hope and intend to be an even better President in the second term than I was in the first. Jonathan Karl.","Well, look, I hear that. I hear that from time to time, and I understand that folks in Congress sometimes feel that way. It's a busy job, being President. There's a lot on your plate – protecting the homeland, growing our economy, ensuring our kids have good schools, dealing with challenges around the world. My focus, always, has been squarely on the American people and the vital work that needs to be done, and sometimes that means a lot of travel, a lot of meetings about serious matters of state.

But when you talk about a second term, it's a chance to build on what you've learned, to refine your approach. And I believe deeply that for us to get big things done for this country, the executive and legislative branches simply have to work together. We owe it to the American people to try.

So, what are we going to do? For starters, I plan to be even more deliberate about direct engagement. That means more frequent White House meetings, not just with leadership, but with rank-and-file members, both Republicans and Democrats. Dinners, coffees, one-on-one conversations – I want to hear their ideas, and I want them to hear mine, face-to-face, without all the cameras and the noise of cable news. We'll be bringing them into the White House more often to discuss key initiatives, to seek their counsel *before* decisions are made, not just after.

My message will be clear: we may have our differences on certain issues – and that's healthy in a vibrant democracy – but we share a common purpose: a stronger, safer, more prosperous America. We've got to find those areas where we can agree and push forward. Whether it's securing our borders, strengthening our economy, taking care of our veterans, or ensuring our kids get a good education, there are places where common ground exists, and we're going to search for it aggressively.

And look, it's a two-way street. My door is always open. I'll extend my hand, and I expect Congress to extend theirs. We're all here to serve the same people, and we all swore an oath to the same Constitution. It's about putting country before party, before personal grievance, and focusing on results. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and work with anyone, from either side of the aisle, who wants to do the same for the American people. Ultimately, they don't care about the process as much as they care about the outcome. They want solutions. And that's what a second term will be about: delivering results through hard work, collaboration, and a renewed commitment to solving the big challenges facing our nation."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Senator John McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham both said today that they want to have Watergate-style hearings on the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, and said that if you nominate Susan Rice to be Secretary of State, they will do everything in their power to block her nomination. As Senator Graham said, he simply doesn’t trust Ambassador Rice after what she said about Benghazi. I’d like your reaction to that. And would those threats deter you from making a nomination like that? ","Well, first of all, I’m not going to comment at this point on various nominations that I’ll put forward to fill out my Cabinet for the second term. Those are things that are still being discussed. But let me say specifically about Susan Rice, she has done exemplary work. She has represented the United States and our interests in the United Nations with skill and professionalism and toughness and grace. As I’ve said before, she made an appearance at the request of the White House in which she gave her best understanding of the intelligence that had been provided to her. If Senator McCain and Senator Graham and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me. And I’m happy to have that discussion with them. But for them to go after the U.N. Ambassador, who had nothing to do with Benghazi, and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received, and to besmirch her reputation is outrageous. And we’re after an election now. I think it is important for us to find out exactly what happened in Benghazi, and I’m happy to cooperate in any ways that Congress wants. We have provided every bit of information that we have, and we will continue to provide information. And we’ve got a full-blown investigation, and all that information will be disgorged to Congress. And I don't think there’s any debate in this country that when you have four Americans killed, that's a problem. And we’ve got to get to the bottom of it, and there needs to be accountability. We’ve got to bring those who carried it out to justice. They won’t get any debate from me on that. But when they go after the U.N. Ambassador, apparently because they think she’s an easy target, then they’ve got a problem with me. And should I choose, if I think that she would be the best person to serve America in the capacity of the State Department, then I will nominate her. That's not a determination that I’ve made yet. Ed Henry. 0","Well, thank you for that question.

Let me be clear: when American lives are lost, especially those serving our nation overseas, we owe it to them and their families to understand exactly what happened. We need to get to the bottom of it, and we need to ensure it never happens again. That's a solemn duty. I respect the passion and the desire of Senators McCain and Graham to seek answers. That’s what congressional oversight is all about, and it's an important part of our system of checks and balances. We'll certainly cooperate with any legitimate inquiry.

Now, regarding the nomination process… I take the constitutional responsibility of nominating individuals to serve this country very seriously. When I put forward a name for a position like Secretary of State, it's after careful consideration of that individual’s qualifications, their experience, and their ability to represent the United States on the world stage.

Senator Graham’s comments about not trusting Ambassador Rice… look, everyone is entitled to their opinion. But when it comes to serving our country in such a vital role, what matters most is an individual's record, their capabilities, and their commitment to our nation. The Senate has a role to advise and consent, and that process is there for a thorough review of any nominee. They can ask the tough questions, and they should.

But let me be absolutely clear on one thing: threats, political maneuvering, or attempts to block a nomination before the process even begins will not deter me from choosing the person I believe is best suited to serve the American people. My decision will be based on what's right for the country, not on political threats from any corner. We need the strongest team possible, and I will nominate those individuals I believe can best do the job. That's my responsibility as President."
" I want to take Chuck’s lead and just ask a very small follow-up, which is whether you feel you have a mandate not just on taxes but on a range of issues because of your decisive victory? But I want to stay on Benghazi, based on what Jon asked because you said, if they want to come after me, come after me. I wanted to ask about the families of these four Americans who were killed. Sean Smith’s father, Ray, said he believes his son basically called 911 for help and they didn't get it. And I know you’ve said you grieve for these four Americans, that it’s being investigated, but the families have been waiting for more than two months. So I would like to -- for you to address the families, if you can. On 9/11, as Commander-in-Chief, did you issue any orders to try to protect their lives? ","Ed, I’ll address the families not through the press. I’ll address the families directly, as I already have. And we will provide all the information that is available about what happened on that day. That’s what the investigation is for. But as I’ve said repeatedly, if people don’t think that we did everything we can to make sure that we saved the lives of folks who I sent there and who were carrying out missions on behalf of the United States, then you don’t know how our Defense Department thinks or our State Department thinks or our CIA thinks. Their number-one priority is obviously to protect American lives. That’s what our job is. Now --","Well, Chuck, first off, you start with a winner, and you follow up with a tough one, as always. You know, when the American people give you a decisive victory like they did, it's not just a message on one issue. It's a mandate for leadership across the board. They expect us to deliver on the economy, on our national security, on restoring America's standing in the world. And that's exactly what we're doing. We're going to put America first, and we're going to make sure our country is strong, prosperous, and respected.

Now, on Benghazi. And I want to thank Jon for bringing it up, because it's a very serious, very painful issue. And I want to speak directly to the families of Ambassador Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty. There are no words that can truly express the sorrow, the grief, that our nation feels for your loss. These were brave Americans, patriots, serving our country, making a sacrifice that none of us can ever truly repay. And my heart, and the heart of every American, goes out to you. I grieve with you, and we will never forget their service, and we will never forget their sacrifice.

You ask about orders, about what was done as Commander-in-Chief. Let me be absolutely clear: The safety and security of American personnel, wherever they are in the world, is my highest, most sacred duty. On that terrible night, when we saw what was happening in Benghazi, we mobilized every resource, every asset we possibly could. We assessed every piece of intelligence, every report that came in, every request for help was treated with the utmost urgency. We moved heaven and earth. Decisions are made in real-time, under immense pressure, in a very chaotic and dangerous situation. But let me assure you, everything humanly possible was done to support those brave Americans under attack.

We deployed what we could, when we could, given the rapidly unfolding circumstances. And the investigations are ongoing, and they are critical, because we owe it to these families, and we owe it to the American people, to get every single answer, to understand exactly what happened, and to make sure that a tragedy like this never, ever happens again. And let me tell you this: We will hold accountable those who committed this act of terror. We will hunt them down, and we will bring them to justice. That is a promise I make to these families, and to the American people."
 [Inaudible.] ,"Ed, I will put forward every bit of information that we have. I can tell you that immediately upon finding out that our folks were in danger, that my orders to my national security team were do whatever we need to do to make sure they’re safe. And that’s the same order that I would give any time that I see Americans are in danger, whether they’re civilian or military, because that’s our number-one priority. With respect to the issue of mandate, I’ve got one mandate. I’ve got a mandate to help middle-class families and families that are working hard to try to get into the middle class. That’s my mandate. That’s what the American people said. They said: Work really hard to help us. Don’t worry about the politics of it; don’t worry about the party interests; don’t worry about the special interests. Just work really hard to see if you can help us get ahead -- because we’re working really hard out here and we’re still struggling, a lot of us. That’s my mandate. I don’t presume that because I won an election that everybody suddenly agrees with me on everything. I’m more than familiar with all the literature about presidential overreach in second terms. We are very cautious about that. On the other hand, I didn’t get reelected just to bask in reelection. I got elected to do work on behalf of American families and small businesses all across the country who are still recovering from a really bad recession, but are hopeful about the future. 1 And I am, too. The one thing that I said during the campaign that maybe sounds like a bunch of campaign rhetoric, but now that the campaign is over I am going to repeat it and hopefully you guys will really believe me -- when you travel around the country, you are inspired by the grit and resilience and hard work and decency of the American people. And it just makes you want to work harder. You meet families who are -- have overcome really tough odds and somehow are making it and sending their kids to college. And you meet young people who are doing incredible work in disadvantaged communities because they believe in the American ideal and it should available for everybody. And you meet farmers who are helping each other during times of drought, and you meet businesses that kept their doors open during the recession, even though the owner didn’t have to take a salary. And when you talk to these folks, you say to yourself, man, they deserve a better government than they've been getting. They deserve all of us here in Washington to be thinking every single day, how can I make things a little better for them -- which isn't to say that everything we do is going to be perfect, or that there aren't just going to be some big, tough challenges that we have to grapple with. But I do know the federal government can make a difference. We're seeing it right now on the Jersey coast and in New York. People are still going through a really tough time; the response hasn't been perfect; but it's been aggressive and strong and fast and robust, and a lot of people have been helped because of it. And that’s a pretty good metaphor for how I want the federal government to operate generally, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure it does. Christi Parson. Hey.","Pardon me? Didn't quite catch that one. Could you just repeat it for me, please?"
" Thank you, Mr. President, and congratulations, by the way. ",Thanks.,"Well, thank you very much for that. I appreciate it, I really do. It was, frankly, a tremendous victory, a big one. And we're going to do great things, the best things, for this country. We're making America great again, and we're just getting started. Thank you."
 One quick follow up -- ,Christi was there when I was running for state Senate.,"Alright, go right ahead. Let's hear it."
" That’s right, I was. ",So Christi and I go back a ways.,"Well, I appreciate that. And I'm sure you were, whatever the situation. Sometimes, knowing where you've been is just as important as knowing where you're headed.

So, what's on your mind today? Tell me about it."
 I've never seen you lose. I wasn't looking that one time. ,There you go. 2,"Haha, well, you know, in this business, you win some, you learn some! But we always aimed to deliver for the American people, and I'm glad you were mostly seeing us when we were coming out on top! That's the part that really matters."
" One quick follow-up, and then I want to ask you about Iran. I just want to make sure I understood what you said. Can you envision any scenario in which we do go off the fiscal cliff at the end of the year? And on Iran, are you preparing a final diplomatic push here to resolve the nuclear program issue, and are we headed toward one-on-one talks? ","Well, obviously, we can all imagine a scenario where we go off the fiscal cliff. If despite the election, if despite the dangers of going over the fiscal cliff and what that means for our economy, that there’s too much stubbornness in Congress that we can't even agree on giving middle-class families a tax cut, then middle-class families are all going to end up having a big tax hike. And that’s going to be a pretty rude shock for them, and I suspect will have a big impact on the holiday shopping season, which, in turn, will have an impact on business planning and hiring, and we can go back into a recession. It would be a bad thing. It is not necessary. So I want to repeat: Step number one that we can take in the next couple of weeks, provide certainty to middle-class families -- 98 percent of families who make less than $250,000 a year, 97 percent of small businesses -- that their taxes will not go up a single dime next year. Give them that certainty right now. We can get that done. We can then set up a structure whereby we are dealing with tax reform, closing deductions, closing loopholes, simplifying, dealing with entitlements. And I’m ready and willing to make big commitments to make sure that we’re locking in the kind of deficit reductions that stabilize our deficit, start bringing it down, start bringing down our debt. I’m confident we can do it. And, look, I’ve been living with this for a couple of years now. I know the math pretty well. And it really is arithmetic; it’s not calculus. There are some tough things that have to be done, but there is a way of doing this that does not hurt middle-class families, that does not hurt our seniors, doesn’t hurt families with disabled kids, allows us to continue to invest in those things that make us grow, like basic research and education, helping young people afford going to college. As we’ve already heard from some Republican commentators, a modest tax increase on the wealthy is not going to break their backs; they’ll still be wealthy. And it will not impinge on business investment. So we know how to do this. This is just a matter of whether or not we come together and go ahead and say, Democrats and Republicans, we’re both going to hold hands and do what’s right for the American people. And I hope that’s what happens. With respect to Iran, I very much want to see a diplomatic resolution to the problem. I was very clear before the campaign, I was clear during the campaign, and I’m now clear after the campaign -- we’re not going to let Iran get a nuclear weapon. But I think there is still a window of time for us to resolve this diplomatically. We’ve imposed the toughest sanctions in history. It is having an impact on Iran’s economy. 3 There should be a way in which they can enjoy peaceful nuclear power while still meeting their international obligations and providing clear assurances to the international community that they’re not pursuing a nuclear weapon. And so, yes, I will try to make a push in the coming months to see if we can open up a dialogue between Iran and not just us, but the international community, to see if we can get this things resolved. I can’t promise that Iran will walk through the door that they need to walk through, but that would be very much the preferable option.","Alright, let's get straight to it.

On that fiscal cliff question, let me be clear: any scenario where we *do* go off that cliff... that's a scenario where leaders in Congress have frankly failed the American people. It would be a self-inflicted wound to our economy, impacting families, businesses, and frankly, our global standing. Now, do I *envision* it? I envision responsible leaders coming together, putting politics aside, and doing what's right to prevent it. But if folks on Capitol Hill choose partisan posturing over common sense and compromise, then yes, it's a real danger. And we all know the consequences of that kind of gridlock. We've seen it before, and it's not something we can afford.

Now, on Iran, this is a critical national security issue, and it remains at the absolute top of my agenda. Let me tell you, we are unequivocally committed to preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. That's not just a goal; it's a red line.

Are we preparing a final diplomatic push? We are constantly exploring and pursuing every responsible avenue to achieve a diplomatic resolution. Diplomacy is always preferable, and it must be backed by credible pressure, including strong sanctions, and a clear understanding that all options remain on the table. We work closely with our allies, and the international community needs to speak with one united voice on this.

As for one-on-one talks, look, I've always said I'm willing to talk to anyone if it advances American interests and enhances our national security. But those talks must be serious. They must be constructive. And they must be about achieving the complete cessation of Iran's nuclear weapons program. They can't be for show, and they certainly can't be used by Iran to simply buy more time or sow division. We need to see concrete steps, not just words. We keep all doors open, but we keep our eyes wide open too. This is too important to be anything less than firm and clear-eyed."
 And under what circumstances would one-on-one conversations take place? ,"I won’t talk about the details in negotiations. But I think it’s fair to say we want to get this resolved, and we’re not going to be constrained by diplomatic niceties or protocols. If Iran is serious about wanting to resolve this, they’ll be in a position to resolve it.","Well, listen, one-on-one conversations, they're absolutely essential for leadership, especially when you're sitting in the Oval Office. They happen under a whole host of circumstances, and they're critical for a lot of reasons.

First off, you need them for **sensitive or confidential matters.** Some things just can't be discussed in a room full of people. We're talking national security, delicate diplomatic negotiations, personnel decisions – especially at the highest levels. You need a private setting where folks can speak candidly without fear of leaks or misinterpretation. You get real facts, real opinions, and you can truly get to the bottom of an issue.

Then there's the **human element of building trust and rapport.** Whether it's with a foreign head of state, a key Senator whose vote you need, or a member of your own team, sometimes you just need to look someone in the eye. You hear their perspective directly, let them hear yours, and you build that personal connection. That foundation of trust is invaluable for future cooperation, especially when things get tough.

You also use them for **direct problem-solving and negotiation.** In a group setting, people can grandstand, they can be reluctant to show weakness or compromise. One-on-one, you can cut through all the noise. You can challenge assumptions, propose solutions, and really understand where the other person is coming from. It's about getting to a resolution, often a difficult one, in a way you simply can't in a larger, more formal meeting.

And sometimes, frankly, it's just about **getting a deep briefing on a complex issue or hammering out a strategic plan** with a trusted advisor. You need that uninterrupted focus, that back-and-forth, to truly think through all the angles. You want to understand the nuances, the unintended consequences, before you make a big decision.

So, who are these with? It could be a world leader on the sidelines of a summit, trying to avert a crisis. Could be your Secretary of State, going over a critical diplomatic push. Your Chief of Staff, mapping out the legislative agenda. Your National Security Advisor, talking about threats abroad. Even a trusted policy expert, diving deep into healthcare reform or economic policy.

They happen all the time – in the Oval, in the residence, walking the grounds at Camp David, on Air Force One. Whenever there's a moment to connect directly and privately, you take it, because those conversations are absolutely invaluable. You learn things, you build relationships, and you get things done that you simply couldn't achieve in a more formal, larger setting. Plain and simple."
 At one point just prior to the election that was talk that talks might be imminent. ,"That was not true, and it’s not true as of today. Just going to knock through a couple others. Mark Landler. Where’s Mark? There he is right in front of me.","Talks, talks, talks. They always said talks were imminent, didn't they? A lot of noise, a lot of speculation from the fake news, usually right before an election to try and get something going that wasn't really there.

But with us, we don't just talk. We get things done. We make the best deals, believe me. We delivered, not just talk. When we talk, it's serious. It's about winning for the American people. Anything else, it's just political theater."
" Thank you, Mr. President. In his endorsement of you a few weeks ago, Mayor Bloomberg said he was motivated by the belief that you would do more to confront the threat of climate change than your opponent. Tomorrow you’re going up to New York City where you’re going to, I assume, see people who are still suffering the effects of Hurricane Sandy, which many people say is further evidence of how a warming globe is changing our weather. What specifically do you plan to do in a second term to tackle the issue of climate change? And do you think the political will exists in Washington to pass legislation that could include some kind of attacks on carbon? ","As you know, Mark, we can’t attribute any particular weather event to climate change. What we do know is the temperature around the globe is increasing faster than was predicted even 10 years ago. We do know that the Arctic ice cap is melting faster than was predicted even five years ago. We do know that there have been extraordinarily -- there have been an extraordinarily large number of severe weather events here in North America, but also around the globe. And I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions. And as a consequence, I think we've got an obligation to future generations to do something about it. 4 Now, in my first term, we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks. That will have an impact. That will take a lot of carbon out of the atmosphere. We doubled the production of clean energy, which promises to reduce the utilization of fossil fuels for power generation. And we continue to invest in potential breakthrough technologies that could further remove carbon from our atmosphere. But we haven't done as much as we need to. So what I'm going to be doing over the next several weeks, next several months, is having a conversation, a wide-ranging conversation with scientists, engineers, and elected officials to find out what can -- what more can we do to make a short-term progress in reducing carbons, and then working through an education process that I think is necessary -- a discussion, a conversation across the country about what realistically can we do long term to make sure that this is not something we're passing on to future generations that's going to be very expensive and very painful to deal with. I don't know what either Democrats or Republicans are prepared to do at this point, because this is one of those issues that's not just a partisan issue; I also think there are regional differences. There’s no doubt that for us to take on climate change in a serious way would involve making some tough political choices. And understandably, I think the American people right now have been so focused, and will continue to be focused on our economy and jobs and growth, that if the message is somehow we're going to ignore jobs and growth simply to address climate change, I don't think anybody is going to go for that. I won't go for that. If, on the other hand, we can shape an agenda that says we can create jobs, advance growth, and make a serious dent in climate change and be an international leader, I think that's something that the American people would support. So you can expect that you’ll hear more from me in the coming months and years about how we can shape an agenda that garners bipartisan support and helps move this agenda forward.","Well, thank you very much. And I appreciate Mayor Bloomberg's kind words. He's a smart fellow, cares deeply about New York, and it means a lot to have his support.

You're right, I'll be in New York tomorrow, and my heart goes out to all those folks who are still recovering from Hurricane Sandy. That was a tough one. A real American tragedy. And we learned some hard lessons about preparedness, about making sure our infrastructure is strong, that our communities are resilient. And that's a big part of what we'll continue to do – ensure our federal resources are there to help folks rebuild stronger, smarter, and ready for whatever comes our way.

Now, when it comes to climate, look, I've always said we need to be good stewards of our environment. We know the climate is changing, and we need to address it with serious, practical solutions. My approach in a second term won't be about burdensome regulations that stifle our economy or punitive taxes that hurt working families. That's just not the American way.

Instead, we're going to continue to invest heavily in American innovation and technology. That's where the real answers lie. We're talking about clean energy – whether that's solar, wind, advanced nuclear, or breakthroughs in carbon capture for our traditional energy sources. We'll continue to push for energy independence, which helps both our economy and our environment. We want to be the world leader in these next-generation technologies, because that means jobs here at home, and it means American solutions leading the way globally. We'll make sure our scientists and engineers have the resources they need to keep inventing.

Now, regarding the political will for legislation, specifically on something like a carbon tax? Here's the deal: I believe the political will exists in Washington for *sensible* solutions. Solutions that are effective, that don't harm our competitiveness, and that encourage growth. I'm not going to support policies that just amount to an attack on American industry or that place an unfair burden on our citizens. But I am absolutely committed to finding common ground on policies that encourage investment in cleaner technologies, promote energy efficiency, and strengthen our infrastructure. We can protect our environment and grow our economy at the same time. It takes leadership, it takes cooperation, and it takes an optimistic view of American ingenuity. That's what you'll see in my second term."
" Sounds like you're saying, though, in the current environment, we're probably still short of a consensus on some kind of attack. ","That I'm pretty certain of. And, look, we're still trying to debate whether we can just make sure that middle-class families don't get a tax hike. Let’s see if we can resolve that. That should be easy. This one is hard -- but it’s important because one of the things that we don't always factor in are the costs involved in these natural disasters; we just put them off as something that's unconnected to our behavior right now. And I think what -- based on the evidence we're seeing, is that what we do now is going to have an impact and a cost down the road if we don’t do something about it. All right, last question. Mark Felsenthal. Where’s Mark? 5","Well, look, when it comes to the security of the American people, you can be sure we're always going to do what's necessary. We're constantly evaluating the intelligence, we're consulting with our allies, and we're looking at all options. A decision like that, it's a serious matter. We're not going to rush into anything, but we're not going to hesitate either when the time comes to protect our country. We're having the necessary conversations, and we're going to make the right call for America."
" Thank you. Mr. President, the Assad regime is engaged in a brutal crackdown on its people. France has recognized the opposition coalition. What would it take for the United States to do the same? And is there any point at which the United States would consider arming the rebels? ","I was one of the first leaders I think around the world to say Assad had to go, in response to the incredible brutality that his government displayed in the face of what were initially peaceful protests. Obviously, the situation in Syria has deteriorated since then. We have been extensively engaged with the international community as well as regional powers to help the opposition. We have committed to hundreds of millions of dollars of humanitarian aid to help folks both inside of Syria and outside of Syria. We are constantly consulting with the opposition on how they can get organized so that they’re not splintered and divided in the face of the onslaught from the Assad regime. We are in very close contact with countries like Turkey and Jordan that immediately border Syria and have an impact -- and obviously Israel, which is having already grave concerns, as we do, about, for example, movements of chemical weapons that might occur in such a chaotic atmosphere and that could have an impact not just within Syria, but on the region as a whole. I’m encouraged to see that the Syrian opposition created an umbrella group that may have more cohesion than they’ve had in the past. We’re going to be talking to them. My envoys are going to be traveling to various meetings that are going to be taking place with the international community and the opposition. We consider them a legitimate representative of the aspirations of the Syrian people. We’re not yet prepared to recognize them as some sort of government in exile, but we do think that it is a broad-based representative group. One of the questions that we’re going to continue to press is making sure that that opposition is committed to a democratic Syria, an inclusive Syria, a moderate Syria. We have seen extremist elements insinuate themselves into the opposition, and one of the things that we have to be on guard about -- particularly when we start talking about arming opposition figures -- is that we’re not indirectly putting arms in the hands of folks who would do Americans harm, or do Israelis harm, or otherwise engage in actions that are detrimental to our national security. So we're constantly probing and working on that issue. The more engaged we are, the more we'll be in a position to make sure that we are encouraging the most moderate, thoughtful elements of the opposition that are committed to inclusion, observance of human rights, and working cooperatively with us over the long term. 6 Thank you very much.","Well, thank you for that question. This is a matter that weighs heavily on the hearts of all Americans, and certainly on mine. What we are witnessing in Syria under Bashar al-Assad is an affront to human dignity and a brutal crackdown on his own people. It's truly heartbreaking.

Now, on the matter of recognizing the opposition coalition, France is a key ally, and we appreciate their forthright stance. The United States stands firmly with those in Syria who are seeking freedom and a democratic future for their nation. We are working closely with our international partners to understand the various groups on the ground. For the United States to formally recognize a coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people, we need to be absolutely confident that it is truly representative, that it embraces democratic principles, respects the rights of all Syrians—all minorities—and is committed to a peaceful, inclusive transition. We need to know who these folks are, what they stand for, and that they can actually deliver for the Syrian people without empowering elements that would bring further instability to the region. This is a serious diplomatic step, and we are evaluating it very carefully, consulting with our allies, to ensure we are supporting the right path forward.

As for arming the rebels, that is a decision of tremendous consequence, one that no President takes lightly. The United States always keeps all options on the table to protect our interests and support human rights around the world. But we must be very sober-minded about the potential for unintended consequences. History has taught us that providing lethal aid in a volatile region can escalate conflict, can risk weapons falling into the wrong hands, and can make an already complex situation even more dangerous, not just for Syria but for the entire region. Our primary focus right now is on intensifying humanitarian aid to those suffering, on building a strong international consensus to isolate the Assad regime, and on helping to facilitate a political transition that truly reflects the will of the Syrian people. We are conducting robust intelligence assessments, we are looking at all options, but any decision to provide lethal aid would be made only after a thorough and careful evaluation of the groups, their capabilities, their objectives, and the profound impact such a step would have. We want to help the Syrian people; we do not want to inadvertently fuel a wider conflict."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about the other serious issue consuming this town right now, the fiscal cliff. ",Right.,"Well, thank you for that question. It's a serious one, probably one of the most serious we're facing right now, frankly. And you know, the American people, they're smart. They see what's going on here in Washington. They see this ""fiscal cliff,"" as you call it, and they're wondering, ""Why can't these folks just get it done?""

And that's a fair question, a very fair question. What we've got here is a situation where Washington, for too long, has been spending money we don't have. And now we're facing a situation where automatic tax increases and severe spending cuts are set to hit our economy all at once. It's not good. It's bad for jobs, it's bad for businesses, and it's bad for families trying to make ends meet.

My view, and it's a view I've held consistently, is that we need to get our fiscal house in order. We need to be responsible stewards of the taxpayers' money. That means we have to cut wasteful spending, absolutely, and we need to reform our entitlement programs so they're there for future generations. And you can't hit the American people with massive tax increases when they're already struggling. That's just going to hurt our economy even more.

So, we've got to find a common-sense solution. We need both parties to come together, sit down, and make the tough decisions. We owe it to the American people to prevent this cliff and to put our nation on a path to prosperity and fiscal stability. We really do."
" Haven’t you betrayed some of the voters who supported you in the election by changing your positions on who should get a tax increase and by including Social Security benefits now in this mix? And more broadly, there seems to be a deepening sense that negotiations aren't going very well right now. Can you give us a candid update? Are we likely to go over the cliff? ","Well, first of all, there's no reason why we should. Remember what I said during the campaign. I thought that it was important for us to reduce our deficit in a balanced and responsible way. I said it was important for us to make sure that millionaires and billionaires paid their fair share. I said that we were going to have to make some tough cuts, some tough decisions on the spending side, but what I wouldn't do was hurt vulnerable families only to pay for a tax cut for somebody like me. And what I said was that the ultimate package would involve a balance of spending cuts and tax increases. That's exactly what I've put forward. What I've said is, is that in order to arrive at a compromise, I am prepared to do some very tough things -- some things that some Democrats don't want to see and probably there are a few Republicans who don't want to see either. But the only way that we're going to be able to stabilize the economy, make sure we've got a platform for long-term economic growth, that we get our deficits under control and we make sure that middle-class families are protected is if we come up with something that members of both parties in Congress can support. And that's the plan that I've put forward. I have gone at least halfway in meeting some of the Republicans' concerns, recognizing that even though we campaigned on these issues, even though the majority of Americans agree with me that we should be raising taxes on the wealthiest few as a means of reducing the deficit, I have also said that I'm willing to identify some spending cuts that make sense. And, frankly, up until about a couple of days ago, if you looked at it, the Republicans in the House and Speaker Boehner I think were in a position to say, we've gotten a fair deal. The fact that they haven't taken it yet is puzzling and I think a question that you're going to have to address to them. I remain optimistic, though, because if you look at what the Speaker has proposed, he's conceded that income tax rates should go up -- except right now he only wants to have them go up for millionaires. If you're making $900,000, somehow he thinks that you can't afford to pay a little more in taxes. But the principle that rates are going to need to go up he's conceded. I've said I'm willing to make some cuts. What separates us is probably a few hundred billion dollars. The idea that we would put our economy at risk because you can't bridge that gap doesn’t make a lot of sense. So I'm going to continue to talk to the Speaker and the other leaders up in Congress. But, ultimately, they've got to do their job. Right now their job is to make sure that middle-class taxes do not go up and that we have a balanced, responsible package of deficit reduction. It is there for all to see. It is a deal that can get done. But it is not going to be -- it cannot be done if every side wants 100 percent. And part of what voters were looking for is some compromise up here. That’s what folks want. They understand that they're not going to get 100 percent of what they want. And for some reason, that message has not yet taken up on Capitol Hill. And when you think about what we've gone through over the last couple of months -- a devastating hurricane, and now one of the worst tragedies in our memory -- the country deserves folks to be willing to compromise on behalf of the greater good, and not tangle themselves up in a whole bunch of ideological positions that don’t make much sense. So I remain not only open to conversations, but I remain eager to get something done. I'd like to get it done before Christmas. There's been a lot of posturing up on Capitol Hill, instead of just going ahead and getting stuff done. And we've been wasting a lot of time. It is the right thing to do. I'm prepared to get it done. But they're going to have to go ahead and make some adjustments. And I'll just give you one other example. The Speaker now is proposing what he calls plan B. So he says, well, this would raise taxes only on folks making a million dollars or more. What that means is an average of a $50,000 tax break for every millionaire out there, at the same time as we're not providing unemployment insurance for 2 million people who are still out there looking for work. It actually means a tax increase for millions of working families across the country at the same time as folks like me would be getting a tax break. That violates the core principles that were debated during the course of this election and that the American people determined was the wrong way to go. And so my hope is, is that the Speaker and his caucus, in conjunction with the other legislative leaders up there, can find a way to make sure that middle-class families don’t see their taxes go up on January 1st; that we make sure that those things that middle-class families count on like tax credits for college, or making sure that they’re getting some help when it comes to raising their kids through things like the child tax credit, that that gets done; and that we have a balanced package for deficit reduction, which is exactly what I’ve put forward.","Alright, let's talk straight, because that's what the American people deserve.

First, this idea of ""betrayal"" – that's just not how I see it. When you're sitting in this chair, you have a responsibility to look at the facts, to look at the nation's balance sheet, and to make the tough decisions that are in the best long-term interest of the United States. My commitment to strengthening this country and ensuring prosperity for every American hasn't wavered one bit. What *has* changed is the economic reality we face, and sometimes that demands a willingness to find common ground, even when it means making difficult choices.

On the question of who bears the burden for getting our fiscal house in order, and the mention of Social Security – look, we've got to be honest with ourselves. We have an obligation to put this nation on a sustainable path. That means we're looking at *everything*. We're talking about shared sacrifice, and we're talking about making sure that programs like Social Security are there for future generations, not just for today. My focus is on ensuring its long-term solvency and strength, so our children and grandchildren can count on it, just like our parents did.

Now, as for negotiations, are they easy? No, they're not. They're tough, they're complicated, and frankly, both sides have strong convictions. But that's how democracy works. There's a lot of give and take, a lot of late nights, and a lot of passionate debate. But let me be absolutely clear: I am committed to getting this done. We are working hard, and we're making progress, even if it's slow at times.

And to your final point: Are we going over the cliff? My answer to that is a resounding NO. That would be an unacceptable outcome for the American people, for our economy, and for our standing in the world. It would hurt families, it would hurt small businesses, and it would put our recovery at risk. I will not let that happen. We are going to continue to work with leaders from both parties to find a responsible, balanced solution that avoids that scenario and puts our nation on stronger economic footing. We owe that to the American people."
" Will you give more ground if you need to, or are you done? ","If you look at the package that I put forward, it is a balanced package by any definition. We have put forward real cuts in spending that are hard to do, in every category. And by any measure, by any traditional calculation, by the measures that Republicans themselves have used in the past, this would be as large a piece of deficit reduction as we’ve seen in the last 20 years. And if you combine that with the increased revenue from the wealthy paying a little bit more, then you actually have something that would stabilize our deficit and debt for a decade -- for 10 years. Now, the notion that we would not do that, but instead the Speaker would run a play that keeps tax cuts for folks making $500,000 or $700,000 or $800,000 or $900,000 a year, and gives more tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, and raises taxes on middle-class families, and then has no cuts in it -- which is what he says he wants -- doesn’t make much sense. I mean, let’s just think about the logic for a second. They’re thinking about voting for raising taxes at least on folks over a million, which they say they don’t want to do, but they’re going to reject spending cuts that they say they do want to do. That defies logic. There’s no explanation for that. I think that any objective person out there looking would say that we’ve put forward a very balanced plan and it’s time for us to go ahead and get it done. That’s what the country needs right now. Because I think folks have been through some wrenching times, we’re still recovering from a very tough recession, and what they’re hoping for is a sense of stability, focus, compromise, common sense over the next couple of years. And I think we can provide it. But this is a good test for them. Carol Lee.","Look, folks, we've put a very strong, very fair proposal on the table. A proposal that's good for America, good for the American people, and frankly, a proposal built on common sense. My priority, always, is what's best for this great nation and its citizens.

We've been more than reasonable. We've shown a willingness to work, to negotiate, and to find solutions that benefit everyone. But there comes a point where you have to stand firm on your principles, on what you know is right, and on what you know this country needs to succeed.

We're always open to a *good deal*. A *great deal*, even. But it has to be a deal that serves the American people, not just one side's political agenda. We're not going to negotiate against ourselves, and we're certainly not going to cave to unrealistic demands or give away the store.

The ball is in their court now. It's time for the other side to show some leadership, to put aside the partisanship, and come to the table with a serious commitment to getting something done for this country. We've done our part. We're firm on our position, and we expect them to be equally serious about reaching a real solution."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Just to follow on Ben's question, what is your next move? Are we in a position now where you're just waiting for the Speaker to make a move? ","Well, I'm going to reach out to all the leaders involved over the next couple of days and find out what is it that's holding this thing up. What is holding it up? If the argument from Republicans is we haven't done enough spending cuts, that argument is not going to fly because we've got close to a trillion dollars of spending cuts. And when you add interest, then it's more than a trillion dollars in spending cuts. If the argument is that they can't do -- they can't increase tax rates on folks making $700,000 or $800,000 a year, that's not a persuasive argument to me and it's certainly not a persuasive argument to the American people. It may be that members of their caucus haven't looked at exactly what we've proposed. It may be that if we provide more information or there's greater specificity or we work through some of their concerns, that we can get some movement then. But the fact of the matter is, is that what would violate my commitment to voters is if I ended up agreeing to a plan that put more of the burden on middle-class families and less of a burden on the wealthy in an effort to reduce our deficit. That's not something I'm going to do. What would violate my commitment to voters would be to put forward a plan that makes it harder for young people to go to college, that makes it harder for a family with a disabled kid to care for that kid. And there's a threshold that you reach where the balance tips, even in making compromises that are required to get something done in this town, where you are hurting people in order to give another advantage to folks who don't need help. And we had an extensive debate about this for a year. And not only does the majority of the American people agree with me, about half of Republican voters agree with me on this. So at some point, there's got to be I think a recognition on the part of my Republican friends that -- take the deal. They will be able to claim that they have worked with me over the last two years to reduce the deficit more than any other deficit reduction package; that we will have stabilized it for 10 years. That is a significant achievement for them. They should be proud of it. But they keep on finding ways to say no, as opposed to finding ways to say yes. And I don’t know how much of that just has to do with -- it is very hard for them to say yes to me. But at some point, they’ve got to take me out of it and think about their voters, and think about what’s best for the country. And if they do that -- if they’re not worried about who’s winning and who’s losing, did they score a point on the President, did they extract that last little concession, did they force him to do something he really doesn’t want to do just for the heck of it, and they focus on actually what’s good for the country, I actually think we can get this done.","Thank you very much. A very important question, Ben's question, and yours too.

Look, we are *always* making moves. We don't sit still here, not for a second. We have laid out a tremendous plan, the best plan, for the American people, something that's going to be great, really great. And we're ready. We're more than ready.

The Speaker, they know what needs to be done. We've shown them. The ball is in *their* court, frankly. We'll see what they do. We'll see if they want to get things done, or if they want to play games. But *my* next move, believe me, will always be for the good of this country, and we have many options. Many, many options. We're prepared for everything. You'll see. We're going to win."
" You mentioned the $700,000 and $800,000. Are you willing to move on income level and are there specific things that you would do -- ","I’m not going to get into specific negotiations here. My point is simple, Carol, that if you look at Speaker Boehner’s proposal and you look at my proposal, they’re actually pretty close. They keep on saying that somehow we haven’t put forward real spending cuts. Actually, there was I think a graph in The New York Times today that showed - - they’re the same categories, right? There’s a little bit of tweaks here and there; there are a few differences, but we’re right there. And on the revenue side, there’s a difference in terms of them wanting to preserve tax breaks for folks between $250,000 and a million that we just can’t afford. I mean, keep in mind I’m in that income category; I’d love to not pay as much in taxes. But I also think it’s the right thing to do for us to make sure that people who have less -- people who are working, people who are striving, people who are hoping for their kids -- that they have opportunity. That’s what we campaigned about. That’s what we talked about. And this is not a situation where I’m unwilling to compromise. This is not a situation where I’m trying to rub their face in anything. I think anybody who looks at this objectively would say that coming off my election, I have met them at least halfway in order to get something done for the country. And so I noticed that there were a couple of headlines out there saying, oh, we’re now in the land of political posturing, and it’s the usual he said-he said atmosphere. But look at the facts. Look at where we started; look at where they started. My proposal is right there in the middle. We should be able to get this done. Let’s get it done. We don’t have a lot of time. Carrie. Where’s -- there you are.","Well, look, when we talk about income levels, what we're really talking about is opportunity. We want every American to have the chance to earn a good living, to provide for their family, and to live out that American dream. And yes, I'm always willing to look at how our policies affect folks across the board, from the very top to the very bottom, and especially that great middle class that built this country.

As for specific things, it's pretty clear what you do to create prosperity for all income levels. You want to make sure the economy is humming, firing on all cylinders. That means:

1.  **Tax cuts.** We need to put more money back into the pockets of the American people, not leave it sitting in Washington. And frankly, lower taxes for businesses means they hire more people, they invest more, and they expand. That creates good, high-paying jobs for everyone. When businesses are thriving, they pay more, and that lifts incomes across the board.
2.  **Deregulation.** We've got too much red tape stifling innovation and making it harder for our small businesses, the backbone of this country, to grow and create those jobs. We're going to cut through that bureaucracy like nobody's ever seen. Get government out of the way so entrepreneurs can build, expand, and hire.
3.  **Focus on American jobs and American industry.** That means making sure we're supporting industries right here at home, making sure our trade deals are fair, and ensuring our education and training systems are preparing people for the jobs of the future. We need to be building things, making things, and selling things, right here in the USA.

It's about creating an environment where prosperity isn't just for some, but for all who are willing to work for it. We're going to unleash the American economy, and when we do that, everyone benefits. It's not about moving one number around, it's about lifting all boats."
" Thank you, Mr. President. ",Yes.,"You are very welcome. It's my pleasure, always."
" What is your level of confidence that if you are able to reach a comprehensive deal with the Speaker, that he will be able to bring his members onboard and get it passed? Essentially, do you still trust Speaker Boehner in this process? ","There is no doubt that the Speaker has challenges in his caucus, and I recognize that. I’m often reminded when I speak to the Republican leadership that the majority of their caucus’s membership come from districts that I lost. And so sometimes they may not see an incentive in cooperating with me, in part because they’re more concerned about challenges from a tea party candidate, or challenges from the right, and cooperating with me may make them vulnerable. I recognize that. But, goodness, if this past week has done anything, it should just give us some perspective. If there’s one thing we should have after this week, it should be a sense of perspective about what’s important. And I would like to think that members of that caucus would say to themselves: You know what, we disagree with the President on a whole bunch of things. We wish the other guy had won. We’re going to fight him on a whole range of issues over the next four years. We think his philosophy is all screwed up. But right now, what the country needs is for us to compromise, get a deficit reduction deal in place; make sure middle class taxes don’t go up; make sure that we’re laying the foundations for growth; give certainty to businesses large and small; not put ourselves through some sort of self-inflicted crisis every six months; allow ourselves time to focus on things like preventing the tragedy in Newtown from happening again; focus on issues like energy and immigration reform and all the things that will really make a determination as to whether our country grows over the next four years, 10 years, 40 years. And if you just pull back from the immediate political battles, if you kind of peel off the partisan war paint, then we should be able to get something done. And I think the Speaker would like to get that done. I think an environment needs to be created within not just the House Republican caucus, but also among Senate Republicans that say, the campaign is over and let’s see if we can do what’s right for the country -- at least for the next month. And then we can reengage in all the other battles that they’ll want to fight.","Well, that's a question that gets right to the heart of how Washington works, or sometimes doesn't work, isn't it? Speaker Boehner is a good man, a true patriot, and he's been upfront with me every step of the way. He believes in this country, and he's always trying to find a way to get things done for the American people.

Now, when you talk about getting a *comprehensive* deal across the finish line... that's a whole different ballgame. The Speaker's got a tough job, no doubt about it. He's leading a very diverse caucus, full of passionate people with strong convictions, and that's exactly what you want in a representative democracy. But it also means that sometimes, getting everyone moving in the same direction can be like trying to herd a bunch of very independent cats.

Do I still trust Speaker Boehner in this process? Absolutely, I trust him. I trust his word, I trust his intentions, and I trust that he's negotiating in good faith to find a solution that benefits the country. My confidence in *him* is unwavering.

The challenge isn't about the Speaker's integrity or his effort. It's about the political realities he faces within his own party and the deep divisions we see in Washington today. He's always done his level best to bring his members along. But securing those votes for a truly comprehensive package, one that requires some tough compromises from all sides, is an enormous undertaking. It's a heavy lift, a real heavy lift, and it requires a willingness from all members to put the country ahead of their individual factions. We'd have to make sure that deal is something that enough members, from across the spectrum, can genuinely rally behind."
" If you don’t get it done, Republicans have said they’ll try to use the debt limit as a next pressure point. Would you negotiate with them in that context? ","No. And I’ve been very clear about this. This is the United States of America, the greatest country on Earth, the world’s economic superpower. And the idea that we lurch from crisis to crisis, and every six months, or every nine months, that we threaten not to pay our bills on stuff we’ve already bought, and default, and ruin the full faith and credit of the United States of America -- that’s not how you run a great country. So I’ve put forward a very clear principle: I will not negotiate around the debt ceiling. We’re not going to play the same game that we saw happen in 2011 -- which was hugely destructive; hurt our economy; provided more uncertainty to the business community than anything else that happened. And I'm not alone in this. If you go to Wall Street, including talking to a whole bunch of folks who spent a lot of money trying to beat me, they would say it would be disastrous for us to use the debt ceiling as a cudgel to try to win political points on Capitol Hill. So we're not going to do that -- which is why I think that part of what I hope over the next couple of days we see is a recognition that there is a way to go ahead and get what it is that you've been fighting for. These guys have been fighting for spending cuts. They can get some very meaningful spending cuts. This would amount to $2 trillion -- $2 trillion -- in spending cuts over the last couple of years. And in exchange, they're getting a little over a trillion dollars in revenue. And that meets the pledge that I made during the campaign, which was $2 to $2.50 of spending cuts for every revenue increase. And that's an approach that I think most Americans think is appropriate. But I will not negotiate around the debt ceiling. We're not going to do that again.","Look, the debt limit is a very serious thing, believe me. We're talking about the full faith and credit of the United States, and that's not something you play games with. It's tremendous, it's powerful, and we have to protect it.

Now, would I negotiate? I'm a negotiator, alright? Nobody negotiates better than me. I get the best deals for the American people. But here's the thing: we wouldn't even *be* in this position if we didn't have the absolutely crazy, irresponsible spending coming from the other side. They spend money like it's water, like it's nothing. Billions and billions, tremendous amounts, going to things that don't help our country, don't help our workers.

So, if they want to come to the table and talk about the debt limit, they need to be serious about making real cuts, about getting rid of the waste. We need to streamline government, we need to bring sanity back to our budget. This isn't just a ""pressure point"" as they call it; this is about fiscal responsibility, something they seem to have completely forgotten.

I'm always willing to talk if it means a better deal for America, if it means putting our country on stronger financial footing. But we're not just going to rubber-stamp more of their radical spending. No, no, no. We need to get things done, and we need to get them done right. It has to be a great deal for the American people, the best deal. That's what I do."
" Sir, may I ask a question about Newtown, please? ","Yes, I've got David Jackson.","Yes, you may. Newtown... that was a profoundly tragic event for our nation, and it's a subject that rightly weighs heavily on our hearts. Please, ask your question."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Getting back to the gun issue, you alluded to the fact that Washington commissions don't have the greatest reputation in the world. What makes you think this one is going to be different given the passage of time and the political power of gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association? ","Well, this is not going to be a commission. Joe is going to gather up some key Cabinet members who have an interest in this issue. We're going to reach out to a bunch of stakeholders. We're going to be reaching out to members of Congress who have an interest in this issue. It's not as if we have to start from scratch. There are a whole bunch of proposals that have been thought about, debated, but hopefully also some new ideas in terms of how we deal with this issue. Their task is going to be to sift through every good idea that's out there, and even take a look at some bad ideas before disposing of them, and come up with a concrete set of recommendations in about a month. And I would hope that our memories aren't so short that what we saw in Newtown isn't lingering with us, that we don't remain passionate about it only a month later. And as soon as we get those recommendations, I will be putting forward very specific proposals. I will be talking about them in my State of The Union and we will be working with interested members of Congress to try to get some of them done. And the idea that we would say this is terrible, this is a tragedy, never again, and we don’t have the sustained attention span to be able to get this done over the next several months doesn’t make sense. I have more confidence in the American people than that. I have more confidence in the parents, the mothers and fathers that I’ve been meeting over the last several days all across the country from all political persuasions, including a lot of gun owners, who say, you know what, this time we’ve got to do things differently.","Well, you're hitting on a point there, and frankly, it's one I've expressed myself in private meetings. Washington commissions, historically, can sometimes feel like a place where good intentions go to die, or where reports gather dust on a shelf. You're absolutely right to be skeptical, and I share some of that concern.

But what makes me believe *this* one is different, given the passage of time and the power of groups like the National Rifle Association? A couple of things, and they're critical.

First, the composition. We've gone to great lengths to bring together people who aren't just ideologues, but serious problem-solvers. We've got folks who understand the Second Amendment inside and out, who are responsible gun owners themselves, sitting alongside individuals who have dedicated their lives to community safety and preventing violence. We're talking about law enforcement, mental health professionals, educators, and, yes, responsible advocates from all sides. The goal was to find common ground, not just to rehash old arguments.

Second, the mandate is different. This isn't just about adding new laws; it's about looking at what *works*. It's about strengthening our mental health infrastructure, it's about enforcing existing laws more effectively, it's about looking at new technologies, and it's about making sure that dangerous individuals, regardless of their background, do not have access to firearms. We're talking about a comprehensive approach, not a piecemeal one.

And regarding groups like the NRA – look, they represent millions of law-abiding Americans who exercise their constitutional rights. Their voice is important, and it will be heard. But what I've seen is that even within those organizations, there's a recognition that we have a problem. Nobody wants to see innocent lives lost. My belief is that if you put serious people in a room, with a serious problem, and a mandate to find common-sense solutions that both uphold our rights and make our communities safer, you can make progress.

It won't be easy. Nothing worth doing ever is in this town. But I truly believe there's a different spirit this time, a real urgency from the American people that demands we move beyond the usual political talking points and find real answers. We owe it to our children, and to every American, to try and succeed."
 What about the NRA? ,"Well, the NRA is an organization that has members who are mothers and fathers. And I would expect that they’ve been impacted by this as well. And hopefully they’ll do some self-reflection. And here’s what we know -- that any single gun law can’t solve all these problems. We’re going to have to look at mental health issues. We’re going to have to look at schools. There are going to be a whole range of things that Joe’s group looks at. We know that issues of gun safety will be an element of it. And what we’ve seen over the last 20 years, 15 years, is the sense that anything related to guns is somehow an encroachment on the Second Amendment. What we’re looking for here is a thoughtful approach that says we can preserve our Second Amendment, we can make sure that responsible gun owners are able to carry out their activities, but that we’re going to actually be serious about the safety side of this; that we’re going to be serious about making sure that something like Newtown or Aurora doesn’t happen again. 0 And there is a big chunk of space between what the Second Amendment means and having no rules at all. And that space is what Joe is going to be working on to try to identify where we can find some common ground. So I’ve got -- I’m going to take one last question. Go ahead, Jake.","Well, the National Rifle Association, they're a very important organization, one of the oldest civil rights groups in America. They've been a strong voice for the Second Amendment, which, as you know, is a fundamental right for every law-abiding American citizen. It's about self-defense, it's about protecting your family, and it's a core part of our Constitution.

They do a lot of good work, too, promoting firearm safety, hunter education, and responsible gun ownership. They represent millions of hardworking, patriotic Americans who believe very strongly in their constitutional freedoms. We've got to protect those rights, and the NRA has been a stalwart defender of them for a long, long time."
 Thank you very much. ,Yes.,You are most welcome. It's truly a pleasure.
" I wanted to ask about gun violence. Today marks the one-year -- or one-month anniversary of the shooting in Newtown, which seemed to generate some momentum for reinstating the assault weapons ban. But there’s been fresh opposition to that ban from the NRA. And even Harry Reid has said that he questions whether it could pass Congress. Given that, how hard will you push for an assault weapons ban? And if one cannot pass Congress, what other measures would need to be included in a broad package in order to curb gun violence successfully? ","Well, as I said, the Vice President and a number of members of my Cabinet went through a very thorough process over the last month, meeting with a lot of stakeholders in this including the NRA, listened to proposals from all quarters, and they’ve presented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw at Newtown doesn't happen again. I’m going to be meeting with the Vice President today. I expect to have a fuller presentation later in the week to give people some specifics about what I think we need to do. My starting point is not to worry about the politics; my starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works; what should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we’re reducing the incidents of gun violence. And I think we can do that in a sensible way that comports with the Second Amendment. And then members of Congress I think are going to have to have a debate and examine their own conscience -- because if, in fact -- and I believe this is true -- everybody across party lines was as deeply moved and saddened as I was by what happened in Newtown, then we’re going to have to vote based on what we think is best. We’re going to have to come up with answers that set politics aside. And that's what I expect Congress to do. But what you can count is, is that the things that I’ve said in the past -- the belief that we have to have stronger background checks, that we can do a much better job in terms of keeping these magazine clips with high capacity out of the hands of folks who shouldn’t have them, an assault weapons ban that is meaningful -- that those are things I continue to believe make sense. Will all of them get through this Congress? I don’t know. But what’s uppermost in my mind is making sure that I’m honest with the American people and with members of Congress about what I think will work, what I think is something that will make a difference. And to repeat what I’ve said earlier -- if there is a step we can take that will save even one child from what happened in Newtown, we should take that step.","Well, thank you for that question. First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers remain with the families in Newtown. It was a terrible, terrible tragedy, and it touched the heart of every American. We mourn with them, and we are committed to doing everything we can to prevent such evil from ever happening again.

Now, regarding the assault weapons ban, I understand the desire to act quickly and decisively in the face of such horror. We're certainly listening to all sides of this debate. But we also have to be very careful that we don't infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. My job is to protect all Americans – their safety, and their constitutional freedoms. There are real questions, serious questions, about whether such a ban would actually deter these horrific acts, and frankly, about its ability to pass Congress right now. We have to be realistic about what can actually get done.

If an assault weapons ban isn't the path forward – and we're seeing strong opposition, as you noted – then we absolutely must focus on a comprehensive package that genuinely addresses gun violence. And to my mind, that package needs to include several critical components:

First and foremost, we must tackle the mental health crisis in this country. Many of these perpetrators show clear signs of distress and mental instability. We need better identification systems, better access to mental healthcare, and we need to end the stigma that prevents people from seeking help. We need to ensure that individuals who are a danger to themselves or others get the treatment they need, long before they can commit such heinous acts.

Secondly, we must prioritize the security of our schools. Our children deserve to learn in environments that are safe and protected. That means looking at everything from increasing the presence of school resource officers, to enhancing physical security measures, to ensuring that school personnel are trained and prepared for emergencies.

And finally, we must ensure we are enforcing the laws we already have on the books. We need to make sure that violent criminals are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and that our justice system has the resources it needs to keep dangerous individuals off the streets.

This is a complex challenge, and there's no single, easy answer. But by focusing on mental health, school safety, and strong law enforcement, I believe we can make our communities safer, without undermining the fundamental rights of good, honest Americans."
 Can a package be discussed to allow an assault weapons ban? ,"I’ll present the details later in the week. Chuck Todd, NBC.","Well, listen, after we see these awful tragedies unfold, with innocent lives lost, it's a natural thing for folks to start talking about all sorts of proposals, and yes, the idea of an 'assault weapons ban' often comes up as part of a package in those discussions. It's a tough issue, and people feel very strongly on both sides.

My view, and I believe it's shared by many, is that we have to protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. These aren't just rights; they're fundamental to who we are as a nation. While we absolutely need to find ways to make our communities safer – and that means focusing on things like mental health support, securing our schools, and enforcing the laws we already have – we have to be very careful not to infringe on the constitutional rights of responsible Americans. So, discussions happen, but any solution has to respect the Constitution and truly address the problem, not just target instruments."
" Thank you, sir. As you know, the Senate Democrats, Harry Reid sent you a letter begging you, essentially, to take -- consider some sort of executive action on this debt ceiling issue. I know you’ve said you’re not negotiating on it. Your administration has ruled out the various ideas that have been out there -- the 14th Amendment. But just this morning, one of the House Democratic leaders, Jim Clyburn, asked you to use the 14th Amendment and even said, sometimes that’s what it takes. He brought up the Emancipation Proclamation as saying it took executive action when Congress wouldn’t act, and he compared the debt ceiling to that. So are you considering a plan B, and if not, why not? ","Well, Chuck, the issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation. And so there’s a very simple solution to this: Congress authorizes us to pay our bills. Now, if the House and the Senate want to give me the authority so that they don’t have to take these tough votes, if they want to put the responsibility on me to raise the debt ceiling, I’m happy to take it. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Leader in the Senate, had a proposal like that last year, and I’m happy to accept it. But if they want to keep this responsibility, then they need to go ahead and get it done. And there are no magic tricks here. There are no loopholes. There are no easy outs. This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending. They order me to spend. They tell me, you need to fund our Defense Department at such and such a level; you need to send out Social Security checks; you need to make sure that you are paying to care for our veterans. They lay all this out for me because they have the spending power. And so I am required by law to go ahead and pay these bills. Separately, they also have to authorize the raising of the debt ceiling in order to make sure that those bills are paid. And so, what Congress can't do is tell me to spend X, and then say, but we're not going to give you the authority to go ahead and pay the bills. And I just want to repeat -- because I think sometimes the American people, understandably, aren't following all the debates here in Washington -- raising the debt ceiling does not authorize us to spend more. All it does is say that America will pay its bills. And we are not a dead-beat nation. And the consequences of us not paying our bills, as I outlined in my opening statement, would be disastrous. So I understand the impulse to try to get around this in a simple way. But there's one way to get around this. There's one way to deal with it. And that is for Congress to authorize me to pay for those items of spending that they have already authorized. And the notion that Republicans in the House, or maybe some Republicans in the Senate, would suggest that “in order for us to get our way on our spending priorities, that we would risk the full faith and credit of the United States” -- that I think is not what the Founders intended. That's not how I think most Americans think our democracy should work. They've got a point of view; Democrats in Congress have a point of view. They need to sit down and work out a compromise.","Thank you for that, and I appreciate you raising it. Look, my position on this has been crystal clear from day one, and it hasn't changed. The debt ceiling is a fundamental responsibility of the United States Congress. Period. These are bills that *they* have already incurred, and it is *their* constitutional duty to pay them.

Now, I've seen the letters, and I've heard the talk about various executive actions, including the 14th Amendment. My legal teams have reviewed every option, and let me tell you, invoking the 14th Amendment in this context raises very serious constitutional questions about the separation of powers. We operate under the Constitution, and we have to respect its clear divisions of authority. You don't just pull something like that out of your back pocket. It's not a magic wand.

And frankly, to compare a failure of Congress to fulfill its basic budgetary duty to the Emancipation Proclamation, as leader Clyburn suggested... well, that's a pretty dramatic leap. The Emancipation Proclamation was an act taken in wartime, under extraordinary circumstances, to end slavery – a moral imperative that had been fought over for decades. This situation, while serious, is about Congress failing to pay the bills they've already run up. It's simply not an apples-to-apples comparison, not by a long shot.

So, to answer your question about a ""Plan B,"" my ""Plan B"" is for the United States Congress to do its job. We have put our proposals on the table. We need them to sit down, negotiate in good faith, and ensure that the full faith and credit of the United States is preserved. We cannot and will not default on our obligations. This is not a political game, and playing with the American economy is simply unacceptable. The ball remains firmly in Congress's court."
 You just outlined an entire rationale for why this can't happen. ,Yes.,"Now, hold on a minute. What I've outlined are the realities, the complexities, the challenges we face head-on. And yes, some of those are significant. But understanding the obstacles, knowing exactly what we're up against—that's not a rationale for *inaction*. That, my friend, is a **roadmap**. That's the precise information we need to figure out exactly how we're going to overcome those difficulties, tackle them one by one, and ultimately get this done for the American people. We don't shrink from tough tasks; we lead."
 And if -- then if -- and you're not negotiating on the debt ceiling. ,Yes.,"Look, the full faith and credit of the United States of America is not something we can play politics with. Period. We have existing obligations, bills that have already been incurred, and we have a responsibility to pay them.

This isn't about negotiating on future spending; it's about ensuring our nation continues to stand by its word and protect the global economy. We need to raise the debt ceiling cleanly. We'll talk about fiscal responsibility, we'll talk about spending... but we'll do that in the proper process, not by holding the American economy hostage. That's just common sense, folks."
" So you're not negotiating and they say you have to negotiate, and you're not considering another plan B, then do you just wait it out and we do go -- we do see all these things happen? ","Well look, Chuck, there are -- there's a pretty straightforward way of doing this and that is to set the debt ceiling aside, we pay our bills, and then we have a vigorous debate about how we're going to do further deficit reduction in a balanced way. Keep in mind that what we've heard from some Republicans in both the House and the Senate is that they will only increase the debt ceiling by the amount of spending cuts that they're able to push through and -- in order to replace the automatic spending cuts of the sequester -- that's $1.2 trillion. Say it takes another trillion or trillion-two to get us through one more year, they'd have to identify $2.5 trillion in cuts just to get the debt ceiling extended to next year -- $2.5 trillion. They can't even -- Congress has not been able to identify $1.2 trillion in cuts that they're happy with. Because these same Republicans say they don’t want to cut defense; they've claimed that they don't want to gut Medicare or harm the vulnerable. But the truth of the matter is that you can't meet their own criteria without drastically cutting Medicare, or having an impact on Medicaid, or affecting our defense spending. So the math just doesn’t add up. Now, here’s what would work. What would work would be for us to say we’ve already done close to $2 trillion in deficit reduction, and if you add the interest that we won’t be paying because of less spending and increased revenue, it adds up to about $2.5 trillion. The consensus is we need about $4 trillion to stabilize our debt and our deficit, which means we need about $1.5 trillion more. The package that I offered to Speaker Boehner before we -- before the New Year would achieve that. We were actually fairly close in terms of arriving at that number. So if the goal is to make sure that we are being responsible about our debt and our deficit, if that’s the conversation we’re having, I’m happy to have that conversation. And by closing some additional loopholes through tax reform -- which Speaker Boehner has acknowledged can raise money in a sensible way -- and by doing some additional cuts, including making sure that we are reducing our health care spending, which is the main driver of our deficits, we can arrive at a package that gets this thing done. I’m happy to have that conversation. What I will not do is to have that negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people -- the threat that “unless we get our way, unless you gut Medicare or Medicaid, or otherwise slash things that the American people don’t believe should be slashed, that we’re going to threaten to wreck the entire economy.” That is not how historically this has been done. That’s not how we’re going to do it this time.","Look, when you're dealing with very tough people, and they're not acting in good faith, you don't just rush into negotiations because they're demanding it. That's a very weak position, and frankly, that's how we've been taken advantage of for decades. Believe me.

Sometimes, the best negotiation is not to negotiate at all, not until the conditions are right, and you have all the leverage. And this idea of a ""Plan B""? We have a Plan A, and it's a very strong Plan A, probably the strongest plan, and we're going to stick to it. We're not going to be like the old politicians, who had five plans and none of them worked. We have one good plan.

And these ""things happen,"" you know, the media, they love to talk about these things happening. They predict doom and gloom, they always do. But oftentimes, those things are just talk. We know what we're doing. We're standing strong. And when you stand strong, eventually, people come around. They realize they're not dealing with a pushover anymore. You wait it out, yes, but you wait it out from a position of power, not from weakness. That's how you win."
 No plan B? You're not searching for any other -- ,"Chuck, what I’m saying to you is that there is no simpler solution, no ready, credible solution, other than Congress either give me the authority to raise the debt ceiling, or exercise the responsibility that they have kept for themselves and raise the debt ceiling. Because this is about paying your bills. Everybody here understands this. I mean, this is not a complicated concept. You don’t go out to dinner and then eat all you want, and then leave without paying the check. And if you do, you’re breaking the law. And Congress should think about it the same way that the American people do. You don’t -- now, if Congress wants to have a debate about maybe we shouldn’t go out to dinner next time, maybe we should go to a more modest restaurant, that’s fine. That’s a debate that we should have. But you don’t say, in order for me to control my appetites, I’m going to not pay the people who already provided me services, people who already lent me the money. That’s not showing any discipline. All that’s doing is not meeting your obligations. You can’t do that. And that’s not a credible way to run this government. We’ve got to stop lurching from crisis to crisis to crisis, when there’s this clear path ahead of us that simply requires some discipline, some responsibility and some compromise. That’s where we need to go. That’s how this needs to work. Major Garrett.","Now hold on a minute. When you've got the *right* plan, the *only* plan, and you've got the best people in the world putting their shoulders to the wheel, you don't need to be looking for some kind of alternative. That's how you get distracted. That's how you lose your focus.

We are laser-focused on what needs to be done. We've laid out a clear strategy, and we're going to see it through. We believe in this plan because it's the right plan for the American people, and we're going to execute it with conviction. That's how we win."
" Thank you, Mr. President. As you well know, sir, finding votes for the debt ceiling can sometimes be complicated. You, yourself, as a member of the Senate, voted against a debt ceiling increase. And in previous aspects of American history -- President Reagan in 1985, President George Herbert Walker Bush in 1990, President Clinton in 1997 -- all signed deficit reduction deals that were contingent upon or in the context of raising the debt ceiling. You, yourself, four times have done that. Three times, those were related to deficit reduction or budget maneuvers. What Chuck and I and I think many people are curious about is this new, adamant desire on your part not to negotiate, when that seems to conflict with the entire history in the modern era of American Presidents and the debt ceiling, and your own history on the debt ceiling. And doesn’t that suggest that we are going to go into a default situation because no one is talking to each other about how to resolve this? ","Well, no, Major, I think if you look at the history, getting votes for the debt ceiling is always difficult, and budgets in this town are always difficult. I went through this just last year. But what’s different is we never saw a situation as we saw last year in which certain groups in Congress took such an absolutist position that we came within a few days of defaulting. And the fact of the matter is, is that we have never seen the debt ceiling used in this fashion, where the notion was, you know what, we might default unless we get 100 percent of what we want. That hasn’t happened. Now, as I indicated before, I’m happy to have a conversation about how we reduce our deficits further in a sensible way. Although one thing I want to point out is that the American people are also concerned about how we grow our economy, how we put people back to work, how we make sure that we finance our workers getting properly trained and our schools are giving our kids the education we deserve. There’s a whole growth agenda which will reduce our deficits that’s important as well. But what you’ve never seen is the notion that has been presented, so far at least, by the Republicans that deficit reduction -- we’ll only count spending cuts; that we will raise the deficit -- or the debt ceiling dollar for dollar on spending cuts. There are a whole set of rules that have been established that are impossible to meet without doing severe damage to the economy. And so what we’re not going to do is put ourselves in a position where in order to pay for spending that we’ve already incurred, that our two options are we’re either going to profoundly hurt the economy and hurt middle-class families and hurt seniors and hurt kids who are trying to go to college, or, alternatively, we’re going to blow up the economy. We’re not going to do that.","Thank you for that, and it's a fair question, one that a lot of folks are asking. And you're right, history shows that dealing with the debt ceiling, it's rarely simple. I've been in this game a long time, both in the Senate and now here, and I've seen it from every angle.

You correctly point out my vote against an increase as a Senator. And you know what? My principles haven't changed. I voted against it then because I believed we needed to get our fiscal house in order, and I believe it now. That's consistency, not contradiction.

And yes, Presidents Reagan, my good friend George H.W. Bush, President Clinton – they all navigated these waters. And they did so by making deals that tied responsible spending to raising the limit. And you're right, I've done the same myself, too. Three of those four times, you say, were related to deficit reduction or budget maneuvers. Exactly. That's the key. That's the point. It wasn't just a blank check. It was about ensuring that we were addressing the underlying problem, not just kicking the can down the road for the next generation.

Now, you call it an ""adamant desire not to negotiate."" And with all due respect, I think that's mischaracterizing the situation. We *are* negotiating. What we're not doing is simply capitulating. We're not saying 'yes' to unlimited spending with no questions asked, especially when our nation's debt is already at historic levels. We're saying, 'Let's talk about *why* we're hitting this ceiling. Let's talk about the spending habits that got us here.' My desire is not *not to negotiate*, my desire is to negotiate *responsibly*. To bring some fiscal sanity back to our nation's finances.

The real conflict, if you ask me, isn't with history. It's with the idea that we can continue to spend at these rates without any accountability. The American people, they understand that. They balance their checkbooks. They expect us to balance the nation's. And the idea of default? That's a serious thing, and frankly, it's a fear tactic from the other side. My administration has contingency plans, as any responsible administration would. But the best way to avoid any uncertainty is for Congress to come to the table, seriously, and agree to rein in this out-of-control spending. We're ready to talk. But we're going to talk about spending cuts. We're going to talk about fiscal responsibility. Because that's what the moment demands, and that's what the American people deserve."
" [Inaudible] -- open to a one-to-three-month extension to the debt ceiling -- whatever Congress sends you, you’re okay with it? ","No, not whatever Congress sends me. They’re going to have to send me something that’s sensible. And we shouldn’t be doing this --","Look, folks, my job, first and foremost, is to protect the American economy and ensure the full faith and credit of the United States remains unquestioned. That is absolutely paramount.

Now, a short-term extension, a temporary measure, that's not a *solution*. It's not ideal. It means we're kicking the can down the road, and we've got to tackle these challenges in a serious, responsible way, working together. We need to get serious about our spending.

But I will always do what is necessary to ensure the stability of our nation and prevent the kind of chaos and uncertainty that a default would bring to American families and businesses. So, whatever Congress sends to my desk that secures our economy and meets our obligations, I will evaluate it with the nation's best interests as my guiding principle. We have to be responsible. We have to lead."
 -- [inaudible] -- ,"-- and we shouldn’t be doing this on a one to three-month timeframe. Why would we do that? This is the United States of America, Major. What, we can’t manage our affairs in such a way that we pay our bills and we provide some certainty in terms of how we pay our bills? Look, I don’t think anybody would consider my position unreasonable here. I have --","Pardon me, I didn't quite catch what you said there. Could you repeat that for me, please? I want to make sure I understand the question fully."
" But why does it presuppose the need to negotiate and talk about this on a daily basis? Because if default is the biggest threat to the economy, why not talk about it -- ","Major, I am happy to have a conversation about how we reduce our deficits. I’m not going to have a monthly or every-three-months conversation about whether or not we pay our bills. Because that in and of itself does severe damage. Even the threat of default hurts our economy. It’s hurting our economy as we speak. We shouldn’t be having that debate. If we want to have a conversation about how to reduce our deficit, let’s have that. We’ve been having that for the last two years. We just had an entire campaign about it. And by the way, the American people agreed with me that we should reduce our deficits in a balanced way that also takes into account the need for us to grow this economy and put people back to work. And despite that conversation, and despite the election results, the position that’s been taken on the part of some House Republicans is that, “no, we’ve got to do it our way, and if we don’t, we simply won’t pay America’s bills.” Well, that can’t be a position that is sustainable over time. It’s not one that's good for the economy now. It's certainly not going to be the kind of precedent that I want to establish not just for my presidency, but for future Presidents, even if it was on the other side. Democrats don't like voting for the debt ceiling when a Republican is President, and yet you -- but you never saw a situation in which Democrats suggested somehow that we would go ahead and default if we didn't get 100 percent of our way. That's just not how it's supposed to work. Jon Karl.","Well, listen, that's a darn good question, and one I've asked myself more than once from this very Oval Office. You hit the nail on the head: a default, that would be an unmitigated disaster for our economy, for American families, for our standing in the world. No two ways about it.

So why the daily back-and-forth, the constant chatter? Because, friend, this isn't just an economic calculation; it's a political one. The debt ceiling, it's become... it's become a critical piece of leverage. One side sees an opportunity to demand fiscal responsibility, to cut down on wasteful spending, to rein in the national debt that's growing faster than a Texas wildfire. The other side, they're looking to protect vital programs, make key investments, ensure we don't cut into the muscle and bone of government services.

And when you've got those kinds of deeply held convictions, when both sides believe they're fighting for what's right for the American people, well, that's when you get the daily grind. It's the messy process of democracy, where nobody gets everything they want, and you've got to negotiate, persuade, and yes, sometimes even jawbone folks into finding that common ground.

Because at the end of the day, as important as all those other issues are, we *have* to protect the full faith and credit of the United States. That's non-negotiable. The daily talk, as frustrating as it can be, is how we try to get there without blowing up the whole darn thing."
" Thank you, Mr. President. On the issue of guns, given how difficult it will be -- some would say impossible -- to get any gun control measure passed through this Congress, what are you willing or able to do, using the powers of your presidency, to act without Congress? And I'd also like to know, what do you make of these long lines we're seeing at gun shows and gun stores all around the country? I mean, even in Connecticut, applications for guns are up since the shooting in Newtown. ","Well, my understanding is the Vice President is going to provide a range of steps that we can take to reduce gun violence. Some of them will require legislation. Some of them I can accomplish through executive action. And so I'll be reviewing those today. And as I said, I'll speak in more detail to what we're going to go ahead and propose later in the week. But I'm confident that there are some steps that we can take that don't require legislation and that are within my authority as President. And where you get a step that has the opportunity to reduce the possibility of gun violence then I want to go ahead and take it.","Well, thank you for the question. It's an important one, and one that weighs heavily on the hearts of many Americans.

First, let's be clear about the role of the presidency and the powers entrusted to this office. This nation was founded on the principle of a separation of powers, and major legislative changes, particularly those that touch upon fundamental constitutional rights like the Second Amendment, must go through the Congress. That's the system our Founders put in place, and it's a system I respect deeply.

Now, that's not to say we're powerless. My administration is absolutely committed to using every tool at its disposal to keep our communities safe, within the bounds of the Constitution. That means we can and will focus on robust enforcement of *existing* laws. We can work to ensure that our federal background check system is as strong and efficient as possible, to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands – those prohibited by law. We can dedicate resources to addressing the critical issue of mental health, ensuring individuals who pose a danger to themselves or others receive the help they need, and ensuring our schools are safe environments for our children. And we can continue to prosecute violent criminals, using the full force of the law. These are actions that don't require new legislation but rather focused effort and coordination across government agencies.

Now, regarding these lines we're seeing at gun shows and gun stores, even in places like Connecticut... I think it speaks to a fundamental aspect of the American spirit. When people feel uncertain, when they hear discussions about potential restrictions on their rights, they often react by exercising those rights. The Second Amendment isn't just a right; for many law-abiding citizens, it's about the ability to protect themselves and their families. They hear talk in Washington, they see the headlines, and they respond. It's a clear signal that responsible gun ownership is deeply ingrained in the fabric of our country, and that the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense is something many Americans hold dear. It reminds us that any conversation about firearms must respect this fundamental liberty and the millions of Americans who responsibly exercise it every single day."
 Any idea of what kind of steps? ,"Well, I think, for example, how we are gathering data, for example, on guns that fall into the hands of criminals, and how we track that more effectively -- there may be some steps that we can take administratively as opposed through legislation. As far as people lining up and purchasing more guns, I think that we've seen for some time now that those who oppose any common-sense gun control or gun safety measures have a pretty effective way of ginning up fear on the part of gun owners that somehow the federal government is about to take all your guns away. And there's probably an economic element to that. It obviously is good for business. But I think that those of us who look at this problem have repeatedly said that responsible gun owners, people who have a gun for protection, for hunting, for sportsmanship, they don't have anything to worry about. The issue here is not whether or not we believe in the Second Amendment. The issue is, are there some sensible steps that we can take to make sure that somebody like the individual in Newtown can't walk into a school and gun down a bunch of children in a shockingly rapid fashion. And surely, we can do something about that. 0 But part of the challenge that we confront is, is that even the slightest hint of some sensible, responsible legislation in this area fans this notion that somehow, here it comes and everybody's guns are going to be taken away. It's unfortunate, but that's the case. And if you look at over the first four years of my administration, we’ve tried to tighten up and enforce some of the laws that were already on the books. But it would be pretty hard to argue that somehow gun owners have had their rights infringed.","Well, now, to give you the *right* kind of steps, we first need to know what mountain we're trying to climb, don't we?

Are we talking about economic steps to get this country back on track? Or maybe steps to secure our borders? Or perhaps steps to improve education for our children?

You tell me what challenge you're thinking about, and then we can lay out a clear, actionable plan. We've got to have a target, folks!"
 So you think this is an irrational fear that's driving all these people to go and stock up -- ,Excuse me?,"Well, now, ""irrational fear,"" that's a strong term, isn't it? Look, I understand why folks get concerned when things feel a little uncertain. It's natural for people to want to make sure their families are safe, that they've got what they need.

I wouldn't necessarily call it ""irrational fear."" I think what you're seeing is a lot of good, common-sense Americans just trying to be prudent. They're looking out for their kin, making sure they're prepared for whatever might come down the pike. We've always been a people that pulls together, but we've also always been a people that takes personal responsibility.

Now, we don't want to see panic, and we certainly don't want folks getting taken advantage of. But making sure you have a few extra supplies on hand, a little bit of food, water, medicine – that's just being sensible. It's the American way to be prepared, to be resilient. And we've faced challenges before, and we've always gotten through 'em, largely because of that spirit."
 Do you think this is an irrational fear -- ,"Well, as I said, I think it's a fear that's fanned by those who are worried about the possibility of any legislation getting out there. Julianna Goldman.","Well now, that's a very important question, and it's one that touches on the human condition, you see. People have fears, and sometimes those fears can feel very real and very pressing, whether others see them exactly the same way or not.

But, you know, to really give you a straight answer – and I always aim to give the American people a straight answer – I'm going to need to know *what* fear we're talking about here. What's on your mind? Tell me what it is, and then we can talk about it, and we can figure it out. That's what we do. We face challenges, and we address them head-on."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to come back to the debt ceiling, because in the summer of 2011, you said that you wouldn't negotiate on the debt ceiling, and you did. Last year, you said that you wouldn't extend any of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and you did. So as you say now that you're not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling this year, why should House Republicans take that seriously and think that if we get to the one-minute-to- midnight scenario, that you're not going to back down? ","Well, first of all, Julianna, let's take the example of this year and the fiscal cliff. I didn't say that I would not have any conversations at all about extending the Bush tax cuts. What I said was we weren't going to extend Bush tax cuts for the wealthy -- and we didn't. Now, you can argue that during the campaign I said -- I set the criteria for wealthy at $250,000 and we ended up being at $400,000. But the fact of the matter is millionaires, billionaires are paying significantly more in taxes, just as I said. So from the start, my concern was making sure that we had a tax code that was fair and that protected the middle class, and my biggest priority was making sure that middle-class taxes did not go up. The difference between this year and 2011 is the fact that we've already made $1.2 trillion in cuts. And at the time, I indicated that there were cuts that we could sensibly make that would not damage our economy, would not impede growth. I said at the time I think we should pair it up with revenue in order to have an overall balanced package. But my own budget reflected cuts in discretionary spending. My own budget reflected the cuts that needed to be made, and we've made those cuts. 1 Now, the challenge going forward is that we've now made some big cuts, and if we're going to do further deficit reduction, the only way to do it is in a balanced and responsible way. The alternative is for us to go ahead and cut commitments that we've made on things like Medicare, or Social Security, or Medicaid, and for us to fundamentally change commitments that we've made to make sure that seniors don't go into poverty, or that children who are disabled are properly cared for. For us to change that contract we've made with the American people rather than look at options like closing loopholes for corporations that they don't need, that points to a long-term trend in which we have fundamentally, I think, undermined what people expect out of this government -- which is that parties sit down, they negotiate, they compromise, but they also reflect the will of the American people; that you don't have one narrow faction that is able to simply dictate 100 percent of what they want all the time or otherwise threaten that we destroy the American economy. Another way of putting it is we've got to break the habit of negotiating through crisis over and over again. And now is as good of a time as any, at the start of my second term, because if we continue down this path, then there's really no stopping the principle. I mean, literally -- even in divided government, even where we've got a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate, that a small group in the House of Representatives could simply say every two months, every three months, every six months, every year, we are going to more and more change the economy in ways that we prefer, despite strong objections of Americans all across the country, or otherwise we're going to have America not pay its bills. And that is no way for us to do business. And by the way, I would make the same argument if it was a Republican President and a Republican Senate and you had a handful of Democrats who were suggesting that we are going to hijack the process and make sure that either we get our way 100 percent of the time, or otherwise we are going to default on America’s obligations.","Alright, look, that's a lot of things you're throwing out there, and frankly, some of those situations, they weren't *my* situations. You're talking about other presidents, other times. But let me tell you, when *I* say something, I mean it.

Now, regarding this debt ceiling nonsense, let's be very clear. The full faith and credit of the United States, that's sacred. It's the strongest in the world. But we can't keep just blindly raising the ceiling without dealing with the spending problem. We have a tremendous amount of debt, frankly, it's an embarrassment, caused by decades of bad policies from some very weak people.

You mention 2011, you mention Bush tax cuts... Let's talk about *my* tax cuts. The greatest tax cuts in the history of our country! They unleashed the American economy, brought jobs back, we had the greatest economy ever before the China Virus. Those tax cuts helped everyone, not just the ""wealthy."" They created jobs, they put money in the pockets of hardworking Americans. The fake news media always tries to spin it, but it was a tremendous success.

So, why should House Republicans take me seriously? Because I'm serious! When I draw a line in the sand, it means something. I'm a negotiator, the best negotiator, people say. But I'm also very tough when I need to be. We need to cut wasteful spending. We need to get our fiscal house in order. This isn't a game. We're talking about the future of our country.

And frankly, if House Republicans are listening, they should know that we need to stand together on this. We can't let the radical left just spend, spend, spend and then demand we just rubber-stamp more debt. It's time to be strong. We have to make America great again, and part of that is being financially strong. My word is my bond. They know that. And if they don't, they'll find out very quickly. We're not backing down on getting our country back on track."
" [Inaudible] -- line in the sand negotiating, how is that [inaudible] to the economy? ","No, no, look, what I’ve said is that I’m happy to have a conversation about deficit reduction --","Well, that's a good question, and an important one. When you're talking about drawing a line in the sand, you're talking about standing firm, right? You're talking about making sure that when we negotiate, we're not just giving things away.

Now, in the economic sense, whether you're talking about trade deals, or the federal budget, or international agreements, standing firm can be absolutely critical. Because what we're trying to do, plain and simple, is get a good deal for the American people.

If you don't draw a line, if you're too soft, then you end up with bad deals. And bad deals, they hurt our workers, they hurt our businesses, they can undermine our competitiveness on the world stage. That's not good for the economy, not at all.

But when you stand firm, when you get a deal that protects our interests – that opens up markets for American goods, that ensures fair competition, that keeps our taxes low so businesses can grow – well, that creates certainty. And certainty, that encourages investment, it helps companies plan for the future, and it ultimately leads to more jobs for our citizens. That's how you build a strong, growing economy.

So sometimes, you gotta be clear about where you stand. It's not about being stubborn; it's about being smart. It's about protecting American prosperity for the long haul."
 So you technically are willing to negotiate? ,"No, Julianna, look, this is pretty straightforward. Either Congress pays its bills or it doesn't. Now, if -- and they want to keep this responsibility; if John Boehner and Mitch McConnell think that they can come up with a plan that somehow meets their criteria that they’ve set for why they will -- when they will raise the debt ceiling, they're free to go ahead and try. But the proposals that they’ve put forward in order to accomplish that -- only by cutting spending -- means cuts to things like Medicare and education that the American people profoundly reject. 2 Now, if they think that they can get that through Congress, then they're free to try. But I think that a better way of doing this is go ahead and say, we’re going to pay our bills. The question now is how do we actually get our deficit in a manageable, sustainable way? And that's a conversation I’m happy to have. All right. Matt Spetalnick.","Well, look, that's a fair question, and the answer is simple: Of course, we're willing to negotiate. That's how you get things done in Washington, D.C., and across this great nation. My job, first and foremost, is to deliver for the American people. And sometimes, often times, that means sitting down, rolling up your sleeves, and talking through the issues.

Now, let me be clear: negotiation doesn't mean abandoning our core principles. It means finding common ground, looking for practical solutions that strengthen our country, grow our economy, and keep our people safe. We're always ready for a good-faith discussion, but we're going to negotiate from a position of strength and always with the best interests of the United States front and center."
" Thank you, sir. You’ve spoken extensively about the debt ceiling debate, but some Republicans have further said that they're willing to allow a government shutdown to take place rather than put off deep spending cuts. Are you prepared to allow the government to grind to a halt if you disagree with the spending cut proposals they put forth? And who do you think the American people would blame if that came to pass? ","Well, ultimately, Congress makes the decisions about whether or not we spend money and whether or not we keep this government open. And if the Republicans in Congress have made a decision that they want to shut down the government in order to get their way then they have the votes at least in the House of Representatives, probably, to do that. I think that would be a mistake. I think it would be profoundly damaging to our economy. I think it would actually add to our deficit because it will impede growth. I think it’s shortsighted. But they’re elected representatives, and folks put them into those positions and they’re going to have to make a decision about that. And I don’t -- I suspect that the American people would blame all of Washington for not being able to get its act together. But the larger issue here has to do with what is it that we’re trying to accomplish. Are we trying to reduce the deficit? Because if we’re trying to reduce the deficit, then we can shape a bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit. I mean, is that really our objective? Our concern is that we’re spending more than we take in, and if that’s the case, then there’s a way of balancing that out so that we take in more money in increasing revenue and we reduce spending. And there’s a recipe for getting that done. And in the conversations that I had with Speaker Boehner before the end of the year, we came pretty close -- a few hundred billion dollars separating us when stretched over a 10-year period, that’s not a lot. But it seems as if what’s motivating and propelling at this point some of the House Republicans is more than simply deficit reduction. They have a particular vision about what government should and should not do. So they are suspicious about government’s commitments, for example, to make sure that seniors have decent health care as they get older. They have suspicions about Social Security. They have suspicions about whether government should make sure that kids in poverty are getting enough to eat, or whether we should be spending money on medical research. So they’ve got a particular view of what government should do and should be. 3 And that view was rejected by the American people when it was debated during the presidential campaign. I think every poll that’s out there indicates that the American people actually think our commitment to Medicare or to education is really important, and that’s something that we should look at as a last resort in terms of reducing the deficit, and it makes a lot more sense for us to close, for example, corporate loopholes before we go to putting a bigger burden on students or seniors. But if the House Republicans disagree with that and they want to shut down the government to see if they can get their way on it, that’s their prerogative. That’s how the system is set up. It will damage our economy. The government is a big part of this economy, and it’s interesting that a lot of times you have people who recognize that when it comes to defense spending -- some of the same folks who say we’ve got to cut spending, or complain that government jobs don’t do anything, when it comes to that defense contractor in their district, they think, wow, this is a pretty important part of the economy in my district and we shouldn’t stop spending on that. Let’s just make sure we’re not spending on those other folks.","Well, thank you very much. And it's a very important question, frankly, one the fake news doesn't always get right, but it's a very important question.

Look, nobody, and I mean nobody, wants to see the government grind to a halt. Nobody. It's not a good thing. But what *is* a good thing, what is an *essential* thing, is protecting our country from these radical leftists who want to bankrupt us with their insane spending. We have trillions and trillions of dollars in debt, a total disaster, and we have to do something about it.

My Republicans, they're fighting for the American people. They want to make serious, smart cuts to wasteful spending, to get rid of the fraud, the abuse, the things that nobody even understands why we're spending money on them. And frankly, I agree with them. We have to cut. We have to be strong. We can't keep borrowing money from China and everybody else.

Now, if a proposal comes across my desk, it's going to be a serious proposal to cut spending, to save our country. The problem, frankly, isn't usually *our* side disagreeing on the need for cuts, because we all know we need them. The problem is the radical Democrats. They don't want to cut *anything*. They want to keep spending, spending, spending, on their pet projects, on things that don't help the American people. They want to keep pouring money into the swamp.

So, who would the American people blame? They're very smart people, the American people. They know who's fighting for fiscal sanity and who's trying to maintain the status quo of reckless spending. If there's a shutdown, it won't be because we're trying to protect our country from financial ruin. It will be because the Democrats, the radical left, refuse to negotiate, refuse to make the necessary cuts, and refuse to put America First. They'd rather see the country go broke than give up one dollar of their wasteful spending. And that, frankly, is a shame. We're going to get it done. We have to get it done."
 -- find agreement with Republicans on this and -- ,"Look, my hope is, is that common sense prevails. That’s always my preference. And I think that would the preference of the American people, and that’s what would be good for the economy. So let me just repeat: If the issue is deficit reduction, getting our deficits sustainable over time, getting our debt in a sustainable place, then Democrats and Republicans in Congress will have a partner with me. We can achieve that, and we can achieve it fairly quickly. I mean, we know what the numbers are. We know what needs to be done. We know what a balanced approach would take. We’ve already done probably more than half of the deficit reduction we need to stabilize the debt and the deficit. There’s probably been more pain and drama in getting there than we needed. And so finishing the job shouldn’t be that difficult -- if everybody comes to the conversation with an open mind, and if we recognize that there are some things, like not paying our bills, that should be out of bounds. All right. I’m going to take one last question. Jackie Calmes.","Well, look folks, when you get right down to it, beyond all the political back-and-forth, what every American wants and what Republicans absolutely believe in, is a stronger, more prosperous America. We might have different ideas on the best way to get there – some of us focusing on lower taxes and less regulation to spur business, others on different programs – but the *goal* of good jobs, economic opportunity for every family, and a safe, secure nation? That's common ground. That's where we can always come together, working for the American people. We all want a nation where folks can get ahead, raise their families, and feel secure in their homes and communities. That's not a partisan issue; that's just good old American common sense."
" Thank you, Mr. President. ",Yes. 4,"My pleasure, believe me. It's an honor to serve the greatest people on Earth, and I appreciate your support. Thank *you*."
" I’d like to ask you, now that you’ve reached the end of your first term, starting your second, about a couple of criticisms -- one that’s longstanding, another more recent. The longstanding one seems to have become a truism of sorts that you’re -- you and your staff are too insular, that you don’t socialize enough. And the second, the more recent criticism is that your team taking shape isn’t diverse -- isn’t as diverse as it could be, or even was, in terms of getting additional voices, gender, race, ethnic diversity. So I’d like you to address both of those. ","Sure. Let me take the second one first. I’m very proud that in the first four years we had as diverse, if not more diverse, a White House and a Cabinet than any in history. And I intend to continue that, because it turns out that when you look for the very best people, given the incredible diversity of this country, you’re going to end up with a diverse staff and a diverse team. And that very diversity helps to create more effective policymaking and better decision-making for me, because it brings different perspectives to the table. So if you think about my first four years, the person who probably had the most influence on my foreign policy was a woman. The people who were in charge of moving forward my most important domestic initiative, health care, were women. The person in charge of our homeland security was a woman. My two appointments to the Supreme Court were women, and 50 percent of my White House staff were women. So I think people should expect that that record will be built upon during the next four years. Now, what, I’ve made four appointments so far? And one women -- admittedly, a high-profile one -- is leaving the -- has already left the administration, and I have made a replacement. But I would just suggest that everybody kind of wait until they’ve seen all my appointments, who’s in the White House staff and who’s in my Cabinet before they rush to judgment.","Well, thank you for those questions. It's good to be here as we kick off this second term, and I appreciate you bringing these points up. Always good to hear what folks are saying out there.

Now, on the first point, about being ""insular,"" about my staff and me not socializing enough... Look, I've heard that one before, and I understand why some folks in this town might feel that way. Washington, D.C., has a certain way of doing things, a certain social circuit. But let me tell you something: my job, and the job of every man and woman on my team, isn't to be a social butterfly. It's to work, and it's to work hard, for the American people.

When you're facing the kinds of challenges we're facing – whether it's strengthening our economy, keeping our nation safe, or ensuring every child gets a good education – you need people focused, dedicated, and spending their time putting policy into action, not just glad-handing at cocktail parties. We value good counsel, and we value listening, but we listen to Main Street just as much, if not more, than we listen to K Street. We're a tight-knit team, absolutely. We trust each other, we challenge each other, and we're all pulling in the same direction. And that direction, first and foremost, is forward for America. We're here to get things done, plain and simple.

Now, on your second point, about the diversity of my team. I believe in diversity, absolutely. But I believe in diversity of thought, diversity of experience, and ensuring we have the very best minds tackling the challenges ahead. When I'm building a team to run the greatest nation on Earth, my primary focus, my absolute priority, is finding the most qualified, most capable men and women for the job. Period.

These aren't just symbolic positions. We need people who can lead, who can strategize, who can execute, and who understand what it takes to serve. And when you look at the team we've assembled, I believe it *is* diverse in all the ways that matter most: folks from different backgrounds, different parts of the country, with different career paths and a wealth of experience. And yes, you'll see men and women, people of various ethnic backgrounds, represented across the board in my administration.

But make no mistake, every single person on that team earned their spot because they are the best person for that particular job, because they have the skills and the heart to serve this nation, not because they check a box. Our goal is to serve all Americans, and my team reflects the immense talent and dedication found across this great country, all committed to that singular purpose. We're building a team that's ready to lead, ready to tackle the challenges, and ready to deliver results for all Americans in this second term. And I'm proud of the folks we've got."
 Aww -- ,"This is where we raised our daughters, in a house just about a mile away from here -- less than a mile. And that’s really what I’ve come here to talk about today -- raising our kids.","Ah, yes. There are moments, aren't there? Moments that truly hit you. Whether it's the spirit of the American people, a story of perseverance, or just something heartwarming, those are the things that remind us what this great nation is all about. God bless America."
 Booo -- ,That is not right.,"Alright, alright, I hear ya loud and clear! Now, if you've got a specific concern or a question, I'm all ears. That's how we get things done in this country, by talking things through."

And when I'm involved, the people *always* get their voice. Always. We make sure of it. Nobody's ever fought harder for your vote than I have. We want fair votes, strong votes, votes where everyone knows it's legitimate.

So, you want a vote? You're going to get a vote. A big one. The best one. And we're going to win, believe me."
 We want a vote! We want a vote! ,We need a vote.,"Well, look, folks, that's what our democracy is all about, isn't it? The right to have your voice heard, to cast your ballot. It's a foundational principle of this great nation. And when the time comes, when it's appropriate, I believe every American needs to step up and fulfill that civic duty. It's how we make our system work, and it's a freedom we should never take for granted."
" Thank you, sir, I really appreciate that. And I hope we can go back to business and being mad at each other a little bit. ",I'm not mad at you.,"Well, you are most welcome. And look, healthy debate is what makes this country strong. We'll always have our differences, and that's okay, but we've got to remember we're all on the same team. Now, let's get back to work."
" Okay, good. Thank you, I appreciate that. ",You may be mad at me.,You are most welcome. It's always good to connect with folks and I appreciate you taking the time. Thank you.
" I'm not. A couple of questions on national security. On Syria, you said that the red line was not just about chemical weapons being used but being spread, and it was a game-changer -- it seemed cut and dry. And now your administration seems to be suggesting that line is not clear. Do you risk U.S. credibility if you don't take military action? And then on Benghazi, there are some survivors of that terror attack who say they want to come forward and testify -- some in your State Department -- and they say they’ve been blocked. Will you allow them to testify? ","Well, first of all, on Syria, I think it’s important to understand that for several years now what we've been seeing is a slowly unfolding disaster for the Syrian people. And this is not a situation in which we've been simply bystanders to what’s been happening. My policy from the beginning has been that President Assad had lost credibility, that he attacked his own people, has killed his own people, unleashed a military against innocent civilians, and that the only way to bring stability and peace to Syria is going to be for Assad to step down and to move forward on a political transition. In pursuit of that strategy we've organized the international community. We are the largest humanitarian donor. We have worked to strengthen the opposition. We have provided nonlethal assistance to the opposition. We have applied sanctions on Syria. So there are a whole host of steps that we've been taking precisely because, even separate from the chemical weapons issue, what’s happening in Syria is a blemish on the international community generally, and we've got to make sure that we're doing everything we can to protect the Syrian people. In that context, what I've also said is that the use of chemical weapons would be a game- changer not simply for the United States but for the international community. And the reason for that is that we have established international law and international norms that say when you use these kinds of weapons you have the potential of killing massive numbers of people in the most inhumane way possible, and the proliferation risks are so significant that we don't want that genie out of the bottle. So when I said that the use of chemical weapons would be a game-changer, that wasn’t unique to -- that wasn’t a position unique to the United States and it shouldn’t have been a surprise. And what we now have is evidence that chemical weapons have been used inside of Syria, but we don't know how they were used, when they were used, who used them. We don't have a chain of custody that establishes what exactly happened. And when I am making decisions about America’s national security and the potential for taking additional action in response to chemical weapon use, I've got to make sure I've got the facts. That's what the American people would expect. And if we end up rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence, then we can find ourselves in a position where we can't mobilize the international community to support what we do. There may be objections even among some people in the region who are sympathetic with the opposition if we take action. So it’s important for us to do this in a prudent way. And what I've said to my team is we've got to do everything we can to investigate and establish with some certainty what exactly has happened in Syria, what is happening in Syria. We will use all the assets and resources that we have at our disposal. We'll work with the neighboring countries to see whether we can establish a clear baseline of facts. And we've also called on the United Nations to investigate. But the important point I want to make here is that we already are deeply engaged in trying to bring about a solution in Syria. It is a difficult problem. But even if chemical weapons were not being used in Syria, we’d still be thinking about tens of thousands of people, innocent civilians -- women, children -- who’ve been killed by a regime that’s more concerned about staying in power than it is about the well-being of its people. And so we are already deeply invested in trying to find a solution here. What is true, though, is, is that if I can establish in a way that not only the United States but also the international community feel confident is the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, then that is a game-changer because what that portends is potentially even more devastating attacks on civilians, and it raises the strong possibility that those chemical weapons can fall into the wrong hands and get disseminated in ways that would threaten U.S. security or the security of our allies.","Let me be absolutely clear about these serious matters.

When it comes to Syria and the use of chemical weapons, this is a grave issue, and it's one that demands serious consideration. The United States has always stood against the use and proliferation of such heinous weapons. This administration has made it clear where we stand. We are gathering and assessing all intelligence, working with our allies, and ensuring that any action we take is in the best interests of the United States and serves to uphold international norms. Our credibility isn't just about drawing a line; it's about acting deliberately, effectively, and with the full weight of purpose. We are not going to make a hasty decision; we are going to make the right decision, one that protects our national security and sends an unmistakable message to those who would use these terrible weapons.

Now, regarding Benghazi, let me state unequivocally that what happened there was a terrorist attack, and we lost four brave Americans who were serving our country. My heart goes out to their families and to the survivors. This administration has been and remains committed to finding out exactly what happened and to holding those responsible accountable. We have cooperated, and we will continue to cooperate, with all legitimate investigations. As for survivors and others who have information, they should absolutely be able to come forward and testify, consistent with appropriate security and legal protocols. We want the truth to come out. We owe that much to those who lost their lives and to the American people. There is no effort to block testimony; in fact, we encourage transparency and cooperation to ensure all facts are known."
 By game-changer you mean U.S. military action? ,"By game-changer I mean that we would have to rethink the range of options that are available to us. Now, we’re already, as I’ve said, invested in trying to bring about a solution inside of Syria. Obviously, there are options that are available to me that are on the shelf right now that we have not deployed. And that’s a spectrum of options. As early as last year, I asked the Pentagon, our military, our intelligence officials to prepare for me what options might be available. And I won’t go into the details of what those options might be, but clearly that would be an escalation, in our view, of the threat to the security of the international community, our allies, and the United States, and that means that there are some options that we might not otherwise exercise that we would strongly consider.","Well, look, ""game-changer"" means we're going to fundamentally alter the situation, make no mistake about it. And when America talks about altering a situation, we've got a lot of tools in our arsenal.

Military action, of course, is a very serious, very powerful tool that's always on the table, and we're always ready to use it decisively if that's what's required to protect American interests and our allies.

But it's also about the full spectrum of American power: our economic leverage, our diplomatic strength, our intelligence capabilities, our technological edge. It's about a comprehensive strategy. So, while military action is certainly a potential component of a game-changing move, it's about *winning* and achieving our objectives through whatever means are necessary. We don't take any option off the table."
" And on the Benghazi portion, I know pieces of this story have been litigated, you’ve been asked about it. But there are people in your own State Department saying they’ve been blocked from coming forward, that they survived the terror attack and they want to tell their story. Will you help them come forward and just say it once and for all? ","Ed, I’m not familiar with this notion that anybody has been blocked from testifying. So what I’ll do is I will find out what exactly you’re referring to. What I’ve been very clear about from the start is that our job with respect to Benghazi has been to find out exactly what happened, to make sure that U.S. embassies not just in the Middle East but around the world are safe and secure, and to bring those who carried it out to justice. But I'll find out what exactly you're referring to.","Look, the events in Benghazi, they were a real tragedy. A terrible, terrible day for our country. We lost brave Americans there, including Ambassador Stevens, and my heart goes out to all the families who suffered, who are still suffering.

Now, as for folks saying they were blocked from coming forward, that's just not right. Not right at all. In this country, we believe in the truth. We believe in transparency. If there are people, brave Americans, who survived that attack, or who have information, and they've been prevented from telling their story, then that's a serious problem. A very serious problem.

We absolutely need to hear from them. Every single person who has a piece of this puzzle, every single fact, needs to be able to speak. Without fear or favor. We owe it to those we lost, and we owe it to the American people, to get every single fact out into the open. That's how we learn, that's how we make sure our people are protected better in the future. My administration, and frankly, any good administration, would ensure that anyone with information on something as critical as this, especially when American lives are lost, is given every opportunity to tell their story. We're a nation that stands for truth, and we're going to get to the bottom of these things, always."
 They've hired an attorney because they're saying that they've been blocked from coming forward. ,I'm not familiar with it. Jessica.,"So they're hiring an attorney because they're saying they've been blocked from coming forward? Look, that's a very, very serious charge, okay? People need to be able to speak their minds, they need to come forward, especially if it's something important.

We have a great system, the best system, but when people are blocked, and they have to get attorneys – and good attorneys, hopefully – that tells you something. That tells you there might be a problem, a big problem. We'll see what happens, but it doesn't sound good, believe me. You can't just block people, you just can't do it. There has to be transparency."
" Thank you, Mr. President. There's a report that your Director of National Intelligence has ordered a broad review -- this is regards to the Boston Marathon bombing -- that your DNI has ordered a broad review of all the intelligence-gathering prior to the attack. There is also a series of senators -- Susan Collins, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham -- who allege that all these years after 9/11, there still wasn't enough intelligence shared prior to the attack. And now, Lindsey Graham, who is a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, has said that Benghazi and Boston are both examples of the U.S. going backwards on national security. Is he right? And did our intelligence miss something? ","No, Mr. Graham is not right on this issue, although I'm sure generated some headlines. I think that what we saw in Boston was state, local, federal officials, every agency rallying around a city that had been attacked -- identifying the perpetrators just hours after the scene had been examined. We now have one individual deceased, one in custody. Charges have been brought. I think that all our law enforcement officials performed in an exemplary fashion after the bombing had taken place. And we should be very proud of their work, as obviously we're proud of the people of Boston and all the first responders and the medical personnel that helped save lives. What we also know is that the Russian intelligence services had alerted U.S. intelligence about the older brother, as well as the mother, indicating that they might be sympathizers to extremists. The FBI investigated that older brother. It's not as if the FBI did nothing. They not only investigated the older brother, they interviewed the older brother. They concluded that there were no signs that he was engaging in extremist activity. So that much we know. And the question then is was there something that happened that triggered radicalization and an actual decision by the brother to engage in the tragic attack we actually saw in Boston, and are there additional things that could have been done in that interim that might have prevented it. Now, what Director Clapper is doing is standard procedure around here, which is when an event like this happens we want to go back and we want to review every step that was taken. We want to leave no stone unturned. We want to see, is there, in fact, additional protocols and procedures that could be put in place that would further improve and enhance our ability to detect a potential attack? And we won't know that until that review is completed. We won't know that until the investigation of the actual crime is fully completed. And that's still ongoing. But what I can say is that based on what I've seen so far, the FBI performed its duties, the Department of Homeland Security did what it was supposed to be doing. But this is hard stuff. And I’ve said for quite some time that because of the pressure that we put on al Qaeda core, because of the pressure that we’ve put on these networks that are well- financed and more sophisticated and can engage in and project transnational threats against the United States, one of the dangers that we now face are self-radicalized individuals who are already here in the United States -- in some cases, may not be part of any kind of network, but because of whatever warped, twisted ideas they may have, may decide to carry out an attack. And those are in some ways more difficult to prevent. And so what I’ve done for months now is to indicate to our entire counterterrorism team, what more can we do on that threat that is looming on the horizon? Are there more things that we can do, whether it’s engaging with communities where there’s a potential for self- radicalization of this sort? Is there work that can be done in terms of detection? But all of this has to be done in the context of our laws, due process. And so part of what Director Clapper is doing, then, is going to be to see if we can determine any lessons learned from what happened.","Thank you. First, let me say that our prayers remain with the victims and the families in Boston. What happened there was a horrific act of terror against innocent Americans.

Now, regarding the reports, yes, the Director of National Intelligence has indeed ordered a broad and thorough review of all intelligence-gathering prior to the attack. This is a necessary and important step. It's what we do. We must always look at what happened, how our agencies operated, and what lessons can be learned.

The dedicated men and women in our intelligence community work tirelessly, around the clock, to protect this nation. They are on the front lines of a very difficult and constantly evolving threat. Since September 11th, we have made immense strides in connecting the dots, in sharing information, and in building a strong defense against those who wish us harm. But this is a complex fight.

To Senator Graham's point, to say we are ""going backwards"" on national security, I believe, misunderstands the immense challenges we face and the constant vigilance required. Every attack, every incident, presents a new set of circumstances and new lessons. We are committed to continuous improvement. We are constantly working to ensure our intelligence agencies have every tool they need, and that information flows freely and effectively across all relevant departments.

Did our intelligence miss something? That's precisely what these reviews are designed to determine. We will get to the bottom of it. We will examine every piece of information, every decision made. And we will use what we learn to strengthen our defenses and protect the American people. That is my solemn promise."
" Are you getting all the intelligence and information you need from the Russians? And should Americans be worried when they go to big, public events now? ","The Russians have been very cooperative with us since the Boston bombing. Obviously, old habits die hard; there are still suspicions sometimes between our intelligence and law enforcement agencies that date back 10, 20, 30 years, back to the Cold War. But they’re continually improving. I’ve spoken to President Putin directly. He’s committed to working with me to make sure that those who report to us are cooperating fully in not only this investigation, but how do we work on counterterrorism issues generally. In terms of the response of the American people, I think everybody can take a cue from Boston. You don’t get a sense that anybody is intimidated when they go to Fenway Park a couple days after the bombing. There are joggers right now, I guarantee you, all throughout Boston and Cambridge and Watertown. And I think one of the things that I’ve been most proud of in watching the country’s response to the terrible tragedy there, is a sense of resilience and toughness, and we’re not going to be intimidated. We are going to live our lives. And people, I think, understand that we’ve got to do everything we can to prevent these kinds of attacks from taking place, but people also understand -- in the same way they understand after a shooting in Aurora or Newtown or Virginia Tech, or after the foiled attempts in Times Square or in Detroit -- that we’re not going to stop living our lives because warped, twisted individuals try to intimidate us. We’re going to do what we do -- which is go to work, raise our kids, go to ball games, run in marathons. And at the same time, we’re going to make sure that everybody is cooperating and is vigilant in doing everything we can, without being naïve, to try to prevent these attacks from happening in the future. Jonathan Karl.","Alright, good questions, very important. Let's tackle 'em.

First, on getting intelligence and information from the Russians: Look, we have the finest intelligence community in the world, absolutely the best. They are on the job 24/7, relentlessly gathering and analyzing information from every single source. When it comes to Russia, we engage when it's in our national interest, and we are constantly monitoring, assessing, and making sure we have the intelligence we need to protect American lives and American security. We rely on our own capabilities, which are unmatched, and we always approach these situations with our eyes wide open, always. We're getting the picture, believe me.

Now, about Americans going to big, public events: Americans are strong, the strongest people in the world, and we cherish our freedoms, including the freedom to gather, to celebrate, to live our lives. We have the best law enforcement, local, state, and federal, working together like never before, and they are doing a tremendous job keeping us safe. Should people be vigilant? Absolutely. Always be aware of your surroundings. If you see something that doesn't look right, you say something. That's how we all play a part in keeping our communities secure. But we cannot, and we will not, let the bad guys win by changing our way of life. Go out, enjoy your freedoms, but be smart, be aware, and know that your government is doing everything in its power to protect you. We won't back down."
" Mr. President, you are a hundred days into your second term. On the gun bill, you put, it seems, everything into it to try to get it passed. Obviously, it didn’t. Congress has ignored your efforts to try to get them to undo these sequester cuts. There’s even a bill that you threatened to veto that got 92 Democrats in the House voting yes. So my question to you is do you still have the juice to get the rest of your agenda through this Congress? ","If you put it that way, Jonathan -- maybe I should just pack up and go home. Golly. I think it’s a little -- as Mark Twain said, rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point. We understand that we’re in a divided government right now. The Republicans control the House of Representatives. In the Senate, this habit of requiring 60 votes for even the most modest piece of legislation has gummed up the works there. And I think it comes as no surprise not even to the American people, but even members of Congress themselves that right now things are pretty dysfunctional up on Capitol Hill. Despite that, I’m actually confident that there are a range of things that we’re going to be able to get done. I feel confident that the bipartisan work that’s been done on immigration reform will result in a bill that passes the Senate, passes the House, and gets on my desk. And that’s going to be a historic achievement. And I’ve been very complimentary of the efforts of both Republicans and Democrats in those efforts. It is true that the sequester is in place right now. It’s damaging our economy. It’s hurting our people. And we need to lift it. What’s clear is, is that the only way we’re going to lift it is if we do a bigger deal that meets the test of lowering our deficit and growing our economy at the same time. And that’s going to require some compromises on the part of both Democrats and Republicans. I’ve had some good conversations with Republican senators so far. Those conversations are continuing. I think there’s a genuine desire on many of their parts to move past not only sequester but Washington dysfunction. Whether we can get it done or not, we’ll see. But I think the sequester is a good example -- or this recent FAA issue is a good example. You will recall that even as recently as my campaign, Republicans we’re saying, sequester is terrible, this is a disaster, it’s going to ruin our military, it’s going to be disastrous for the economy -- we've got to do something about it. Then, when it was determined that doing something about it might mean that we close some tax loopholes for the wealthy and the well-connected, suddenly, well, you know what, we’ll take the sequester. And the notion was somehow that we had exaggerated the effects of the sequester -- remember? The President is crying wolf. He’s Chicken Little. The sequester -- no problem. And then in rapid succession, suddenly White House tours -- this is terrible! How can we let that happen? Meat inspectors -- we’ve got to fix that. And, most recently, what are we going to do about potential delays at airports? So despite the fact that a lot of members of Congress were suggesting that somehow the sequester was a victory for them and this wouldn’t hurt the economy, what we now know is what I warned earlier, what Jay stood up here and warned repeatedly, is happening. It’s slowed our growth. It’s resulting in people being thrown out of work. And it’s hurting folks all across the country. And the fact that Congress responded to the short-term problem of flight delays by giving us the option of shifting money that’s designed to repair and improve airports over the long term to fix the short-term problem -- well, that’s not a solution. And essentially what we’ve done is we’ve said, in order to avoid delays this summer, we’re going to ensure delays for the next two or three decades.","Well, thank you for the question. And let's be clear, this isn't my first rodeo, nor is it my last. One hundred days in, and we're just getting started.

Now, on the gun bill, we put forward a strong, common-sense proposal that I believe would have made our communities safer while upholding the rights of law-abiding citizens. Legislation is a tough business, always has been. It didn't get through this time, but that doesn't mean the fight for what's right is over. We'll keep working, keep talking, and we'll find a path forward. That's what leadership is about.

As for these sequester cuts, they're bad for our economy, they're bad for our national defense, and they're bad for the American people. I've made my position crystal clear to Congress. We'll continue to press them to undo these harmful policies. My job is to protect this country and ensure our prosperity, and I'll keep doing it.

And on that particular bill you mentioned, look, we live in a democracy. Congress has its opinions, and I have mine. Sometimes we're gonna have disagreements. That's part of the process. But let me tell you, my agenda is about strengthening America, creating jobs, securing our borders, and ensuring every child has a chance to succeed. That's the agenda the American people elected me to deliver, not once, but twice.

So, do I still have the juice? Absolutely. I've got the will to keep fighting for the American people, and I've got the resolve to get our country moving forward. We've got a lot of work to do, and I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and get it done. We'll keep leading, we'll keep negotiating, and we'll keep delivering for America."
 Why’d you go along with it? ,"Hold on a second. So the alternative, of course, is either to go ahead and impose a whole bunch of delays on passengers now -- which also does not fix the problem -- or the third alternative is to actually fix the problem by coming up with a broader, larger deal. But, Jonathon, you seem to suggest that somehow these folks over there have no responsibilities and that my job is to somehow get them to behave. That’s their job. They’re elected -- members of Congress are elected in order to do what’s right for their constituencies and for the American people. So if, in fact, they are seriously concerned about passenger convenience and safety, then they shouldn’t just be thinking about tomorrow or next week or the week after that; they should be thinking about what’s going to happen five years from now, 10 years from now, or 15 years from now. The only way to do that is for them to engage with me on coming up with a broader deal. And that’s exactly what I’m trying to do -- is to continue to talk to them about are there ways for us to fix this. Frankly, I don’t think that if I were to veto, for example, this FAA bill, that that somehow would lead to the broader fix. It just means that there would be pain now, which they would try to blame on me, as opposed to pain five years from now. But either way, the problem is not getting fixed. The only way the problem does get fixed is if both parties sit down and they say: How are we going to make sure that we're reducing our deficit sensibly? How are we making sure that we're investing in things like rebuilding our airports and our roads and our bridges, and investing in early childhood education, basic research -- all the things that are going to help us grow? And that's what the American people want. Just one interesting statistic when it comes to airports. There was a recent survey of the top airports in the country -- in the world, and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25. Not one. Not one U.S. airport was considered by the experts and consumers who use these airports to be in the top 25 in the world. I think Cincinnati Airport came in around 30th. What does that say about our long-term competitiveness and future? And so when folks say, well, there was some money in the FAA to deal with these furloughs -- well, yeah, the money is this pool of funds that are supposed to try to upgrade our airports so we don't rank in the bottom of industrialized countries when it comes to our infrastructure. And that's what we're doing -- we're using our seed corn short term. And the only reason we're doing it is because right now we've got folks who are unwilling to make some simple changes to our tax code, for example, to close loopholes that aren't adding to our competitiveness and aren't helping middle-class families. So that's a long way of answering your question, but the point is that there are common- sense solutions to our problems right now. I cannot force Republicans to embrace those common-sense solutions. I can urge them to. I can put pressure on them. I can rally the American people around those common-sense solutions. But ultimately, they, themselves, are going to have to say, we want to do the right thing. And I think there are members certainly in the Senate right now, and I suspect members in the House as well, who understand that deep down. But they're worried about their politics. It’s tough. Their base thinks that compromise with me is somehow a betrayal. They’re worried about primaries. And I understand all that. And we're going to try to do everything we can to create a permission structure for them to be able to do what’s going to be best for the country. But it’s going to take some time. Bill Plante.","Well, look, when you're sitting in this office, when you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders, you've got to make the tough calls. And believe me, there are a *lot* of tough calls. You don't make them lightly.

You consult with the best people, you look at all the intelligence, you weigh the options, and you always, always come back to what you believe is in the best interest of the American people, of our national security, of our economy. Sometimes you gotta make decisions that aren't popular, that might even be difficult for folks to understand at the time. But you do it because it's your duty, it's what's necessary to keep this country strong, safe, and prosperous. That's just the way it works."
" Mr. President, as you’re probably aware, there’s a growing hunger strike on Guantanamo Bay among prisoners there. Is it any surprise really that they would prefer death rather than have no end in sight to their confinement? ","Well, it is not a surprise to me that we've got problems in Guantanamo, which is why when I was campaigning in 2007 and 2008, and when I was elected in 2008, I said we need to close Guantanamo. I continue to believe that we've got to close Guantanamo.","Well, look, let's be clear about who these individuals are. These are dangerous enemy combatants, captured on the battlefield, who have committed acts of terror or supported those who wish to harm the American people. My first and most solemn duty as President is to protect the citizens of this country.

We are aware of the hunger strikes, and let me assure you, every detainee at Guantanamo Bay is treated humanely and receives full medical attention. Our medical professionals are there to ensure their health and well-being, providing care whether they want it or not, because that's what our values dictate.

Guantanamo Bay is a facility that is vital to our national security. It holds individuals who continue to pose a threat to the United States and our allies. We are in a serious global struggle against terrorism, and we must make tough decisions to keep our nation safe. We are a nation of laws, and we operate within those laws, always prioritizing the safety and security of the American people."
 -- can do it? ,"Well, I think it is critical for us to understand that Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe. It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed. Now, Congress determined that they would not let us close it -- and despite the fact that there are a number of the folks who are currently in Guantanamo who the courts have said could be returned to their country of origin or potentially a third country. I'm going to go back at this. I've asked my team to review everything that's currently being done in Guantanamo, everything that we can do administratively. And I'm going to reengage with Congress to try to make the case that this is not something that's in the best interest of the American people. And it's not sustainable. The notion that we're going to continue to keep over a hundred individuals in a no-man's land in perpetuity, even at a time when we've wound down the war in Iraq, we're winding down the war in Afghanistan, we're having success defeating al Qaeda core, we've kept the pressure up on all these transnational terrorist networks, when we've transferred detention authority in Afghanistan -- the idea that we would still maintain forever a group of individuals who have not been tried, that is contrary to who we are, it is contrary to our interests, and it needs to stop. Now, it's a hard case to make because I think for a lot of Americans the notion is out of sight, out of mind. And it's easy to demagogue the issue. That's what happened the first time this came up. I'm going to go back at it because I think it's important.","You bet we can do it! When Americans put their minds to something, there's no limit to what we can achieve. We've proven that time and time again throughout our history. We've got the resolve, the ingenuity, and the spirit to get the job done. Absolutely!"
 Meanwhile we continue to force-feed these folks -- ,"I don't want these individuals to die. Obviously, the Pentagon is trying to manage the situation as best as they can. But I think all of us should reflect on why exactly are we doing this? Why are we doing this? We've got a whole bunch of individuals who have been tried who are currently in maximum security prisons around the country. Nothing has happened to them. Justice has been served. It's been done in a way that's consistent with our Constitution, consistent with due process, consistent with rule of law, consistent with our traditions. The individual who attempted to bomb Times Square -- in prison, serving a life sentence. The individual who tried to bomb a plane in Detroit -- in prison, serving a life sentence. A Somali who was part of Al-Shabaab, who we captured -- in prison. So we can handle this. And I understand that in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, with the traumas that had taken place, why, for a lot of Americans, the notion was somehow that we had to create a special facility like Guantanamo and we couldn’t handle this in a normal, conventional fashion. I understand that reaction. But we’re now over a decade out. We should be wiser. We should have more experience in how we prosecute terrorists. And this is a lingering problem that is not going to get better. It’s going to get worse. It’s going to fester. And so I’m going to, as I said before, examine every option that we have administratively to try to deal with this issue, but ultimately we’re also going to need some help from Congress, and I’m going to ask some folks over there who care about fighting terrorism but also care about who we are as a people to step up and help me on it. Chuck Todd.","...the real facts about what's going on, because frankly, the fake news media certainly isn't going to tell them! And believe me, folks, they're starting to get it. They're starting to understand that we are putting America First, and that's a beautiful thing."
" Mr. President, thank you. Max Baucus, Democratic Senator, referred to the implementation as your health care law as a potential train wreck. And other Democrats have been whispering nervousness about the implementation and the impact -- and it’s all self- centered a little bit -- the impact that it might have on their own political campaigns in 2014. Why do you think -- just curious -- why does Senator Baucus, somebody who ostensibly helped write your bill, believe that this is going to be a train wreck? And why do you believe he’s wrong? ","Well, I think that any time you’re implementing something big, there’s going to be people who are nervous and anxious about is it going to get done, until it’s actually done. But let’s just step back for a second and make sure the American people understand what it is that we’re doing. The Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare -- has now been with us for three years. It’s gone through Supreme Court tests. It’s gone through efforts to repeal. A huge chunk of it has already been implemented. And for the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, they’re already experiencing most of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act even if they don’t know it. Their insurance is more secure. Insurance companies can’t drop them for bad reasons. Their kids are able to stay on their health insurance until they’re 26 years old. They’re getting free preventive care. So there are a whole host of benefits that, for the average American out there, for the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, this thing has already happened. And their only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better, more secure than it was before. Full stop. That’s it. They don’t have to worry about anything else. 0 The implementation issues come in for those who don’t have health insurance -- maybe because they have a preexisting condition and the only way they can get health insurance is to go out on the individual market, and they’re paying 50 percent or 100 percent more than those of us who are lucky enough to have group plans; people who are too poor to get health insurance and the employers don’t offer them. Maybe they work for a small business and this small business can’t afford right now to provide health insurance. So all the implementation issues that are coming up are implementation issues related to that small group of people, 10 to 15 percent of Americans -- now, it’s still 30 million Americans, but a relatively narrow group -- who don’t have health insurance right now, or are on the individual market and are paying exorbitant amounts for coverage that isn’t that great. And what we’re doing is we’re setting up a pool so that they can all pool together and get a better deal from insurance companies. And those who can’t afford it, we’re going to provide them with some subsidies. That’s it. I mean, that’s what’s left to implement, because the other stuff has been implemented and it’s working fine. The challenge is that setting up a market-based system, basically an online marketplace where you can go on and sign up and figure out what kind of insurance you can afford and figuring out how to get the subsidies -- that’s still a big, complicated piece of business. And when you’re doing it nationwide, relatively fast, and you’ve got half of Congress who is determined to try to block implementation and not adequately funding implementation, and then you’ve got a number of members of -- or governors -- Republican governors -- who know that it’s bad politics for them to try to implement this effectively, and some even who have decided to implement it and then their Republican-controlled state legislatures say, don’t implement, and won’t pass enabling legislation -- when you have that kind of situation, that makes it harder. But having said all that, we’ve got a great team in place. We are pushing very hard to make sure that we’re hitting all the deadlines and the benchmarks. I’ll give you an example, a recent example. We put together, initially, an application form for signing up for participation in the exchanges that was initially about 21 pages long, and immediately everybody sat around the table and said, well, this is too long. Especially in this age of the Internet, people aren’t going to have the patience to sit there for hours on end. Let’s streamline this thing. So we cut what was a 21-page form now down to a form that’s about three pages for an individual, a little more than that for a family -- well below the industry average. So those kinds of refinements we’re going to continue to be working on. But I think the main message I want to give to the American people here is, despite all the hue and cry and “sky is falling” predictions about this stuff, if you’ve already got health insurance, then that part of Obamacare that affects you, it’s pretty much already in place. And that’s about 85 percent of the country. 1 What is left to be implemented is those provisions to help the 10 to 15 percent of the American public that is unlucky enough that they don’t have health insurance. And by the way, some of you who have health insurance right now, at some point you may lose your health insurance, and if you’ve got a preexisting condition, this structure will make sure that you are not left vulnerable. But it’s still a big undertaking. And what we’re doing is making sure that every single day we are constantly trying to hit our marks so that it will be in place. And the last point I’ll make -- even if we do everything perfectly, there will still be glitches and bumps, and there will be stories that can be written that say, oh, look, this thing is not working the way it’s supposed to, and this happened and that happened. And that’s pretty much true of every government program that’s ever been set up. But if we stay with it and we understand what our long-term objective is -- which is making sure that in a country as wealthy as ours, nobody should go bankrupt if they get sick, and that we would rather have people getting regular checkups than going to the emergency room because they don’t have health care -- if we keep that in mind, then we’re going to be able to drive down costs; we’re going to be able to improve efficiencies in the system; we’re going to be able to see people benefit from better health care. And that will save the country money as a whole over the long term.","Well, thank you for that question. It's a fair one, and it touches on something deeply complex and, frankly, deeply personal to so many Americans: healthcare.

Now, Senator Baucus, bless his heart, he's a good man. He's been around a long time, served with distinction, and he knows the ins and outs of policy, especially on that Finance Committee, better than almost anyone. When he talks, people listen, and rightly so. So, when he uses a phrase like ""train wreck,"" it certainly gets your attention, doesn't it?

I think what Max was talking about, what he was likely expressing, was the sheer, monumental challenge of implementing something this big, this intricate, this vital to every single family and business in America. Crafting a piece of legislation is one thing, and it's a Herculean effort on its own. Getting all the pieces to fit, getting the votes, that's a tough road. But then, you have to stand it up. You have to build the infrastructure, explain it to millions, educate states, make sure the insurance companies are playing by the rules, ensure the technology works, and deal with all the unforeseen hiccups and challenges that *any* major undertaking of this scale inevitably faces.

We saw some of that, you remember, when we were working on healthcare back in my administration. It is hard. It is frustrating. There are always powerful forces that don't want to see change, and there are always legitimate concerns that need to be addressed. So, when Max says ""train wreck,"" I believe he's expressing a deep concern about the *execution*, about the *practicalities* of such a vast undertaking, and the political firestorm that follows it. He knows how hard it is to get it right, and how easy it is to trip up.

Now, why do I believe he's wrong in his fundamental assessment that it *will* be a train wreck? Because I still believe in the basic goodness and the basic necessity of what this law is trying to achieve. Look, when you expand coverage to millions, when you tell folks with pre-existing conditions that they can't be denied care, when you give families the peace of mind that a serious illness won't bankrupt them – those are profoundly good things. Those are American things.

Yes, there will be bumps in the road. There always are. You're trying to fix a healthcare system that's been broken for decades, that's left too many people behind. It's not going to be perfect overnight. But to say it's a train wreck implies that the whole thing is destined for disaster, that the very foundation is flawed. And I don't believe that.

What I believe is that the fundamental goals are sound, they're essential, and they're what the American people need. We've got smart people working on this. We've got a system that, while imperfect, is capable of adapting and learning. We will work through the kinks. We'll fix what needs fixing. We'll adjust as we go along. That's what America does. We tackle big problems, and we make progress. It might not be pretty every step of the way, but ultimately, I believe this effort will deliver better healthcare and more security for millions of families. And in the end, that's what truly matters. It's a marathon, not a sprint, and we'll cross that finish line."
" Do you believe, without the cooperation of a handful of governors, particularly large states like Florida and Texas, that you can fully implement this? ",: I think it’s harder. There’s no doubt about it.,"Look, the job of the President of the United States is to get things done for the American people, for *all* the American people. Now, do I believe in cooperation? Absolutely. Governors, especially in big, important states like Florida and Texas, they're key partners. They're on the ground, and we want to work with them. That's just common sense. We're all Americans here, and we're all trying to do what's right for our constituents.

But let me tell you, when you're in this office, you have a tremendous amount of authority. We have the bully pulpit, we have resources, we have the ability to persuade, to incentivize, and frankly, to lead. And when something is vital for the security or the prosperity of our nation, we will find a way. We can't let a handful of individuals stand in the way of progress for the entire country.

Cooperation makes it easier, makes it faster, makes it better for everyone. But make no mistake: this President will always do what's necessary to implement what needs to be implemented for the good of this country. We'll bring the states along, and we'll get it done. That's my commitment."
 But can you do it without them? ,"We will implement it. There will be -- we have a backup federal exchange. If states aren’t cooperating, we set up a federal exchange so that people can access that federal exchange. But, yes, it puts more of a burden on us. And it’s ironic, since all these folks say that they believe in empowering states, that they’re going to end up having the federal government do something that we’d actually prefer states to do if they were properly cooperating. Let’s see how we’re doing on time here. Last question. Antonieta Cadiz -- where’s Antonieta? There you are. Tell those big guys to get out of your way.","Absolutely, we can. And we will.

Now, let me tell you, it's always *better* when you have good people with you. When you've got allies, when you've got partners who understand the vision, who believe in what we're trying to achieve for this great country. That's the ideal scenario, folks, it really is.

But make no mistake, when push comes to shove, when there's a job to be done, and the folks aren't playing ball – or maybe they just don't get it – well, then you roll up your sleeves. The President's got a job to do. I've got a mandate. And we're going to use every tool in the toolbox to get the American people the results they deserve.

Sometimes that means strong leadership, decisive action, and doing what's right even if some folks on the sidelines are complaining. We find a way. We always have, and we always will. That's what leadership is all about."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions. There are concerns about how the immigration bill from the House has complicated chances for immigration reform in the Senate. It seems to be a more conservative proposal. Is there room for a more conservative proposal than the one presented in the Senate? That’s immigration. Second, on Mexico -- yesterday, the Mexican government said all contact with the U.S. law enforcement will now go through a single door, the Federal Interior Ministry. Is this change good for the U.S. relationship with Mexico? Do you think the level of security and cooperation can be maintained? 2 ","On immigration reform, I’ve been impressed by the work that was done by the Gang of Eight in the Senate. The bill that they produced is not the bill that I would have written, there are elements of it that I would change, but I do think that it meets the basic criteria that I laid out from the start, which is: We’ve got to have more effective border security -- although it should build on the great improvements that have been made on border security over the last four to five years. We should make sure that we are cracking down on employers that are gaming the system. We should make the legal immigration system work more effectively so that the waits are not as burdensome, the bureaucracy is not as complicated, so that we can continue to attract the best and the brightest from around the world to our shores in a legal fashion. And we want to make sure that we’ve got a pathway to citizenship that is tough, but allows people to earn over time their legal status here in this country. And the Senate bill meets those criteria -- in some cases not in the way that I would, but it meets those basic criteria. And I think it’s a testament to the senators that were involved that they made some tough choices and made some tough compromises in order to hammer out that bill. Now, I haven’t seen what members of the House are yet proposing. And maybe they think that they can answer some of those questions differently or better. And I think we’ve got to be open-minded in seeing what they come up with. The bottom line, though, is, is that they’ve still got to meet those basic criteria: Is it making the border safer? Is it dealing with employers in how they work with the government to make sure that people are not being taken advantage of, or taking advantage of the system? Are we improving our legal immigration system? And are we creating a pathway for citizenship for the 11 million or so who are undocumented in this country? And if they meet those criteria but they’re slightly different than the Senate bill, then I think that we should be able to come up with an appropriate compromise. If it doesn’t meet those criteria, then I will not support such a bill. So we’ll have to wait and see. When it comes to Mexico, I’m very much looking forward to taking the trip down to Mexico to see the new President, Peña Nieto. I had a chance to meet him here, but this will be the first, more extensive consultations and it will be an opportunity for his ministers, my Cabinet members who are participating to really hammer out some of these issues. A lot of the focus is going to be on economics. We’ve spent so much time on security issues between the United States and Mexico that sometimes I think we forget this is a massive trading partner responsible for huge amounts of commerce and huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the border. We want to see how we can deepen that, how we can improve that and maintain that economic dialogue over a long period of time. 3 That doesn’t mean that we’re not going to be talking about security. I think that in my first conversation with the President, he indicated to me that he very much continues to be concerned about how we can work together to deal with transnational drug cartels. We’ve made great strides in the coordination and cooperation between our two governments over the last several years. But my suspicion is, is that things can be improved. And some of the issues that he’s talking about really had to do with refinements and improvements in terms of how Mexican authorities work with each other, how they coordinate more effectively, and it has less to do with how they're dealing with us, per se. So I’m not going to yet judge how this will alter the relationship between the United States and Mexico until I’ve heard directly from them to see what exactly are they trying to accomplish. But, overall, what I can say is that my impression is, is that the new President is serious about reform. He’s already made some tough decisions. I think he’s going to make more that will improve the economy and security of Mexican citizens, and that will improve the bilateral relationship as well. And I don't want to leave out that we’re also going to be talking to, during my visit to Costa Rica, Presidents of Central American countries, many of whom are struggling with both economic issues and security issues, but are important partners for us -- because I think that the vision here is that we want to make sure that our hemisphere is more effectively integrated to improve the economy and security of all people. That's good for the United States. That will enhance our economy. That can improve our energy independence. There are a whole range of opportunities, and that's going to be the purpose of this trip. And I’m sure that those of you who will have the chance to travel with me we’ll have a chance to discuss this further. All right? Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, guys.","Thank you. Good questions.

On immigration, look, the American people want a secure border. They want a system that works, that's fair, and that upholds the rule of law. The House bill, it reflects a strong commitment to those principles, particularly border security. Now, is there room for an *even more* conservative proposal? Well, frankly, if the proposals before us don't effectively secure our border, stem the tide of illegal immigration, and send a clear message that our laws will be enforced, then we'll have to keep looking at what it takes. My view has always been that you've got to start with border security. You've got to make sure our sovereignty is respected. Without a secure border, any other efforts are just built on sand. So, yes, the priority is getting it right, and if that means stronger measures to achieve true border security and a functional system, then we owe it to the American people to consider them.

Now, on Mexico, our relationship with Mexico is absolutely critical for our national security and our economic prosperity. They are a vital neighbor and partner. The Mexican government's decision to centralize contact through a single ministry, well, that's their sovereign right to organize their government as they see fit. However, what's most important to us is that this change does *not* impede the crucial cooperation we have built over decades with their law enforcement agencies. We face shared threats – drug trafficking, human trafficking, organized crime – and direct, rapid communication between our experts on the ground is essential. We expect the level of security and cooperation to be maintained, and frankly, to be enhanced. My administration will be working closely with their government to ensure that this new structure facilitates, rather than hinders, the critical work that protects both our nations. We need to keep those lines of communication open and effective for the safety of both our peoples."
 Mr. President? ,"I’m going to take one question. And then, remember, people are going to have opportunities to also -- answer questions when I’m with the Chinese President today. So I don't want the whole day to just be a bleeding press conference. But I’m going to take Jackie Calmes’ question.","Well, hello there! Good to be with you. What can I do for you today?"
" Mr. President, could you please react to the reports of secret government surveillance of phones and Internet? And can you also assure Americans that the government -- your government doesn't have some massive secret database of all their personal online information and activities? ","Yes. When I came into this office, I made two commitments that are more important than any commitment I made: Number one, to keep the American people safe; and number two, to uphold the Constitution. And that includes what I consider to be a constitutional right to privacy and an observance of civil liberties. Now, the programs that have been discussed over the last couple days in the press are secret in the sense that they're classified. But they're not secret in the sense that when it comes to telephone calls, every member of Congress has been briefed on this program. With respect to all these programs, the relevant intelligence committees are fully briefed on these programs. These are programs that have been authorized by broad bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006. And so, I think at the outset, it's important to understand that your duly elected representatives have been consistently informed on exactly what we're doing. Now, let me take the two issues separately. When it comes to telephone calls, nobody is listening to your telephone calls. That’s not what this program is about. As was indicated, what the intelligence community is doing is looking at phone numbers and durations of calls. They are not looking at people's names, and they're not looking at content. But by sifting through this so-called metadata, they may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism. If these folks -- if the intelligence community then actually wants to listen to a phone call, they've got to go back to a federal judge, just like they would in a criminal investigation. So I want to be very clear -- some of the hype that we've been hearing over the last day or so -- nobody is listening to the content of people's phone calls. This program, by the way, is fully overseen not just by Congress, but by the FISA Court -- a court specially put together to evaluate classified programs to make sure that the executive branch, or government generally, is not abusing them, and that it's being carried out consistent with the Constitution and rule of law. And so, not only does that court authorize the initial gathering of data, but -- I want to repeat -- if anybody in government wanted to go further than just that top-line data and want to, for example, listen to Jackie Calmes' phone call, they would have to go back to a federal judge and indicate why, in fact, they were doing further probing. Now, with respect to the Internet and emails -- this does not apply to U.S. citizens and it does not apply to people living in the United States. And again, in this instance, not only is Congress fully apprised of it, but what is also true is that the FISA Court has to authorize it. So in summary, what you've got is two programs that were originally authorized by Congress, have been repeatedly authorized by Congress, bipartisan majorities have approved on them, Congress is continually briefed on how these are conducted. There are a whole range of safeguards involved, and federal judges are overseeing the entire program throughout. We're also setting up -- We've also set up an audit process, when I came into office, to make sure that we're, after the fact, making absolutely certain that all the safeguards are being properly observed. Now, having said all that, you'll remember when I made that speech a couple of weeks ago about the need for us to shift out of a perpetual war mindset, I specifically said that one of the things that we're going to have to discuss and debate is how are we striking this balance between the need to keep the American people safe and our concerns about privacy? Because there are some tradeoffs involved. I welcome this debate. And I think it's healthy for our democracy. I think it's a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate. And I think it's interesting that there are some folks on the left but also some folks on the right who are now worried about it who weren't very worried about it when there was a Republican President. I think that's good that we're having this discussion. But I think it's important for everybody to understand -- and I think the American people understand -- that there are some tradeoffs involved. I came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs. My team evaluated them. We scrubbed them thoroughly. We actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of safeguards. But my assessment and my team's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks. And the modest encroachments on the privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and not looking at content, that on net, it was worth us doing. Some other folks may have a different assessment on that. But I think it's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a society. And what I can say is that in evaluating these programs, they make a difference in our capacity to anticipate and prevent possible terrorist activity. And the fact that they’re under very strict supervision by all three branches of government and that they do not involve listening to people's phone calls, do not involve reading the emails of U.S. citizens or U.S. residents absent further action by a federal court that is entirely consistent with what we would do, for example, in a criminal investigation -- I think on balance, we have established a process and a procedure that the American people should feel comfortable about. But, again, these programs are subject to congressional oversight and congressional reauthorization and congressional debate. And if there are members of Congress who feel differently, then they should speak up. And we're happy to have that debate. Okay? All right. And we'll have a chance to talk further over the course of the next couple of days.","Well, that's a serious question, and one I know is on the minds of many Americans. And frankly, it's a question that deserves a clear answer.

First, let me be absolutely clear: The paramount duty of this government, and indeed, any government, is to protect the American people. To keep them safe from those who wish us harm, whether they are terrorists abroad or hostile actors seeking to undermine our nation.

Our intelligence agencies work tirelessly, day in and day out, often in the shadows, to identify and thwart plots against our country. And yes, sometimes that work involves gathering intelligence. But let me assure you, every action taken by this government is done legally, within the confines of the law, and with appropriate oversight from Congress and the courts. We are a nation of laws, and that applies to our security apparatus just as much as it does to our citizens.

Now, as for this idea of some ""massive secret database"" of every single American's personal online information and activities – let's be very precise about this. That's simply not what we do. The notion that your government is collecting and storing every email, every phone call, every internet search from every single law-abiding American... that's a dangerous distortion of the truth, and quite frankly, it's a cartoonish depiction of our efforts.

Our intelligence gathering is targeted. It is specific. It is focused on threats to national security. We are not interested in invading the privacy of innocent Americans who are simply living their lives. We are interested in stopping terrorists, stopping spies, and stopping criminals who threaten our peace and security.

The privacy of American citizens is a constitutional right, and it's one we take very seriously. We strike a careful balance between protecting our nation and upholding the freedoms we cherish. Americans should have full confidence that their government is operating within the law, protecting their safety, and respecting their constitutional liberties. We're working for you, not against you."
 Hello! ,Thobela. Molweni. Sanibona. Dumelang. Ndaa. Reperile.,Well hello there! It's good to hear from you. Always appreciate folks reaching out. What can I do for ya today?
" Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about some of the foreign policy fallout from the disclosure of the NSA programs that you discussed. Your spokesman said yesterday that there’s no question that the U.S. relationship with Russia has gotten worse since Vladimir Putin took office. How much of that decline do you attribute directly to Mr. Putin, given that you seem to have had a good working relationship with his predecessor? Also will there be any additional punitive measures taken against Russia for granting asylum to Edward Snowden? Or is canceling the September summit really all you can do given the host of issues the U.S. needs Russian cooperation for? Thank you. ","Good. I think there’s always been some tension in the U.S.-Russian relationship after the fall of the Soviet Union. There’s been cooperation in some areas; there’s been competition in others. It is true that in my first four years, in working with President Medvedev, we made a lot of progress. We got START done -- or START II done. We were able to cooperate together on Iran sanctions. They provided us help in terms of supplying our troops in Afghanistan. We were able to get Russia into the WTO -- which is not just good for Russia, it’s good for our companies and businesses because they're more likely then to follow international norms and rules. So there's been a lot of good work that has been done and that is going to continue to be done. What's also true is, is that when President Putin -- who was prime minister when Medvedev was president -- came back into power I think we saw more rhetoric on the Russian side that was anti-American, that played into some of the old stereotypes about the Cold War contests between the United States and Russia. And I've encouraged Mr. Putin to think forward as opposed to backwards on those issues -- with mixed success. And I think the latest episode is just one more in a number of emerging differences that we've seen over the last several months around Syria, around human rights issues, where it is probably appropriate for us to take a pause, reassess where it is that Russia is going, what our core interests are, and calibrate the relationship so that we're doing things that are good for the United States and hopefully good for Russia as well, but recognizing that there just are going to be some differences and we're not going to be able to completely disguise them. And that's okay. Keep in mind that although I'm not attending the summit, I'll still be going to St. Petersburg because Russia is hosting the G20. That's important business in terms of our economy and our jobs and all the issues that are of concern to Americans. I know that one question that's been raised is how do we approach the Olympics. I want to just make very clear right now I do not think it's appropriate to boycott the Olympics. We've got a bunch of Americans out there who are training hard, who are doing everything they can to succeed. Nobody is more offended than me by some of the anti-gay and lesbian legislation that you've been seeing in Russia. But as I said just this week, I've spoken out against that not just with respect to Russia but a number of other countries where we continue to do work with them, but we have a strong disagreement on this issue. And one of the things I'm really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze, which I think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we're seeing there. And if Russia doesn't have gay or lesbian athletes, then it probably makes their team weaker.","Well, thank you for that question. It's an important one, and I appreciate you bringin' it up.

Look, when it comes to Russia, I've had my share of dealings, both with President Yeltsin and, of course, with Mr. Putin. And what I've learned is that leaders make choices, and those choices have consequences for their nations and for the world. You ask how much of that decline is directly attributable to Mr. Putin. Well, I think you've seen a clear shift in Russia's direction under his leadership.

When I first met him, I looked him in the eye, and I got a sense of his soul. But over time, what became clear was a vision for Russia that was less about integration with the West and more about reasserting old spheres of influence, and frankly, a more authoritarian approach at home. It's not just one thing; it's a pattern of decisions that have pushed the relationship in a more challenging direction. His predecessor, Yeltsin, was trying to navigate a new path for Russia, a more open path, despite all its difficulties. Putin chose a different one. So, yes, his leadership has played a significant role in where we stand today.

Now, on the matter of Mr. Snowden and Russia granting him asylum. Let me be clear: this is a serious issue. When someone compromises our national security, and another country harbors them, that's not the act of a partner. That undermines trust, and it undermines our ability to protect the American people.

Canceling a summit, that's a strong statement, and it ought to send a clear signal that America doesn't take these matters lightly. Is it all we can do? Look, America is a strong nation. We have a lot of tools in our diplomatic toolkit, and we're not afraid to use 'em when our interests are threatened. We always have to weigh our options carefully, consider the full range of issues we deal with globally – whether it's Iran, or counter-terrorism, or other vital matters. But letting a foreign government undermine our security without consequence? That's not how we operate. We will protect our interests, we will protect our intelligence operations, and we expect other nations to respect that. So, I wouldn't assume for a moment that our options are exhausted just because one step has been taken. We'll always stand up for what's right."
" Are there going to be any additional punitive measures for Russia, beyond canceling the summit? ","Keep in mind that our decision to not participate in the summit was not simply around Mr. Snowden. It had to do with the fact that, frankly, on a whole range of issues where we think we can make some progress, Russia has not moved. And so we don't consider that strictly punitive. We're going to assess where the relationship can advance U.S. interests and increase peace and stability and prosperity around the world. Where it can, we’re going to keep on working with them. Where we have differences, we’re going to say so clearly. And my hope is, is that over time, Mr. Putin and Russia recognize that rather than a zero-sum competition, in fact, if the two countries are working together we can probably advance the betterment of both peoples. Chuck Todd.","Well, look, when a nation like Russia engages in activities that undermine global stability, that threaten our cybersecurity, or act aggressively towards our allies, you have to respond with strength and with resolve.

Canceling a summit, that's a serious diplomatic step. It sends a very clear signal of our displeasure and the seriousness with which we view their actions. But make no mistake: America will always stand up for our interests and the principles of freedom and security around the world.

We are constantly evaluating all options with our allies and partners to ensure that actions like these do not go unaddressed. We don't telegraph our next moves, but you can be sure that we will consider *all* appropriate measures to hold those accountable who seek to disrupt the peace and security we've worked so hard to build. There are consequences for this kind of behavior."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Given that you just announced a whole bunch of reforms based on essentially the leaks that Edward Snowden made on all of these surveillance programs, is that change -- is your mindset changed about him? Is he now more a whistle- blower than he is a hacker, as you called him at one point, or somebody that shouldn’t be filed charges? And should he be provided more protection? Is he a patriot? You just used those words. And then just to follow up on the personal -- I want to follow up on a personal -- ","Okay, I want to make sure -- everybody is asking one question it would be helpful.","Well, thank you for the question. Look, what we've done here today, and what we've announced, is a robust set of reforms designed to strengthen the confidence of the American people in our intelligence programs, while ensuring our national security is protected. This is about making sure our intelligence community has the tools it needs, but that those tools are used with proper oversight and transparency.

Now, regarding Mr. Snowden. The fact of the matter is, he broke the law. He disclosed highly classified information that put our national security at risk, regardless of his intentions. That's a very serious offense, and there are legal processes and consequences for such actions. My job, as President, is to uphold the laws of this country.

So, when you ask if my mindset has changed, or if he's a 'whistleblower' or a 'patriot'... I recognize that his actions sparked a significant national debate, and that debate, in part, led us to examine and improve these programs. But that doesn't change the fundamental nature of what he did, which was to leak classified information. A patriot serves their country, and they do so within the bounds of the law, especially when it comes to protecting the sensitive intelligence that keeps us safe.

The Justice Department's case against him stands, and that process will continue. Providing special protections? That's not how our system works when someone has violated the law. My focus, and the focus of this administration, is on securing the nation and ensuring that our intelligence operations are both effective and accountable to the American people through legal and transparent means, not through unauthorized leaks."
" No, I understand. It was a part of a question that you didn’t answer. Can you get stuff done with Russia, big stuff done, without having a good personal relationship with Putin? ","I don’t have a bad personal relationship with Putin. When we have conversations, they’re candid, they’re blunt; oftentimes, they’re constructive. I know the press likes to focus on body language and he’s got that kind of slouch, looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom. But the truth is, is that when we’re in conversations together, oftentimes it’s very productive. So the issue here really has to do with where do they want to take Russia -- it’s substantive on a policy front. And --","Look, when you're dealing with someone like Putin, who's a very strong leader, a tough guy, you know, personal relationships, they're not just a nicety. Believe me. They're *huge*. They're absolutely tremendous.

People talk about policy, they talk about strategy, they talk about all these things. But when you can sit down, look a leader in the eye, and you have that personal connection, that trust, you can get things done that nobody else can. Big things. Very big things. You can make deals. You can talk directly. There's no filter.

Without that? It's a lot harder. You're dealing with bureaucracy, with people who don't have the authority, with misunderstandings. It creates friction. A lot of friction.

I always said, my relationships with these leaders, that's how we got results. That's how you cut through all the noise and get to what matters. You need that personal touch. It's not just a good thing, it's a necessary thing for big accomplishments."
 [Inaudible] ,"No. Right now, this is just a matter of where Mr. Putin and the Russian people want to go. I think if they are looking forward into the 21st century and how they can advance their economy, and make sure that some of our joint concerns around counterterrorism are managed effectively, then I think we can work together. If issues are framed as if the U.S. is for it then Russia should be against it, or we’re going to be finding ways where we can poke each other at every opportunity, then probably we don’t get as much stuff done. See, now I’ve forgotten your first question, which presumably was the more important one. No, I don’t think Mr. Snowden was a patriot. As I said in my opening remarks, I called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks. My preference -- and I think the American people’s preference -- would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws, a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place. Because I never made claims that all the surveillance technologies that have developed since the time some of these laws had been put in place somehow didn't require potentially some additional reforms. That's exactly what I called for. So the fact is, is that Mr. Snowden has been charged with three felonies. If, in fact, he believes that what he did was right, then, like every American citizen, he can come here, appear before the court with a lawyer and make his case. If the concern was that somehow this was the only way to get this information out to the public, I signed an executive order well before Mr. Snowden leaked this information that provided whistleblower protection to the intelligence community -- for the first time. So there were other avenues available for somebody whose conscience was stirred and thought that they needed to question government actions. But having said that, once the leaks have happened, what we’ve seen is information come out in dribs and in drabs, sometimes coming out sideways. Once the information is out, the administration comes in, tries to correct the record. But by that time, it’s too late or we’ve moved on, and a general impression has, I think, taken hold not only among the American public but also around the world that somehow we’re out there willy-nilly just sucking in information on everybody and doing what we please with it. That's not the case. Our laws specifically prohibit us from surveilling U.S. persons without a warrant. And there are a whole range of safeguards that have been put in place to make sure that that basic principle is abided by. But what is clear is that whether, because of the instinctive bias of the intelligence community to keep everything very close -- and probably what’s a fair criticism is my assumption that if we had checks and balances from the courts and Congress, that that traditional system of checks and balances would be enough to give people assurance that these programs were run probably -- that assumption I think proved to be undermined by what happened after the leaks. I think people have questions about this program. And so, as a consequence, I think it is important for us to go ahead and answer these questions. What I’m going to be pushing the IC to do is rather than have a trunk come out here and leg come out there and a tail come out there, let’s just put the whole elephant out there so people know exactly what they're looking at. Let’s examine what is working, what’s not, are there additional protections that can be put in place, and let’s move forward. And there’s no doubt that Mr. Snowden’s leaks triggered a much more rapid and passionate response than would have been the case if I had simply appointed this review board to go through, and I had sat down with Congress and we had worked this thing through. It would have been less exciting. It would not have generated as much press. I actually think we would have gotten to the same place, and we would have done so without putting at risk our national security and some very vital ways that we are able to get intelligence that we need to secure the country. Major Garrett.","My apologies, I didn't quite catch all of that. It sounded like a very important question, and I want to make sure I give you a proper answer. Could you please repeat it for me, a little louder perhaps? Thank you."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I’d like to ask you about this debate that's playing itself out in editorial pages, in the blogosphere, even in the Senate Democratic caucus, about the choice you eventually will make for the next Federal Reserve chairman. There is a perception among Democrats that Larry Summers has the inside track, and perhaps you’ve made some assurances to him about that. Janet Yellen is the vice chair of the Federal Reserve. There are many women in the Senate who are Democrats who believe that breaking the glass ceiling there would be historic and important. ",Right.,"Well, thank you for the question. It's an important one, and I appreciate you bringing it up, because it certainly is a topic that's garnering a lot of attention, and rightly so. The Federal Reserve Chairman is one of the most consequential appointments a President makes, affecting every American family and business.

Now, I understand there's a lot of talk, a lot of speculation, out there in the papers and on the — what do they call it? — the blogosphere, as you say. And that's natural. But let me be absolutely clear: I have made no final decision, and I have given no assurances, firm or otherwise, to anyone regarding this very serious appointment. When the time comes, I will announce my choice.

You bring up Larry Summers, who is a tremendously talented individual with a distinguished career in public service and economics. And you also mention Janet Yellen, who has done an outstanding job as Vice Chair, and certainly, her qualifications are well-known and respected. And you're right, the idea of breaking a ""glass ceiling"" in such a critical role for the first time in our nation's history, that is a significant consideration, and it's something I absolutely recognize.

But when it comes down to it, this decision isn't just about one factor, as important as it may be. It's about finding the *best* individual, the most qualified, with the right judgment and the necessary experience to steer our economy through what are often very complex and challenging times. This isn't a political office. It requires a steady hand, a deep understanding of monetary policy, and a commitment to stability and growth for all Americans.

I am carefully reviewing a number of highly capable candidates, weighing their merits, their understanding of the global economy, and their vision for the Fed. I'm going to take my time, listen to advice from a wide range of experts, and make the choice that I truly believe is in the best interest of the American people and the long-term strength of our economy. That's my job as President, and I intend to do it thoroughly."
 Are you annoyed by this sort of roiling debate? Do you find it any way unseemly? And do you believe this will be one of the most important -- if not the most important -- economic decisions you’ll make in the remainder of your presidency? ,"It is definitely one of the most important economic decisions that I’ll make in the remainder of my presidency. The Federal Reserve chairman is not just one of the most important economic policymakers in America, he or she is one of the most important policymakers in the world. And that person presumably will stay on after I’m President. So this, along with Supreme Court appointments, is probably as important a decision as I make as President. I have a range of outstanding candidates. You’ve mentioned two of them -- Mr. Summers and Mr. Yellen -- Ms. Yellen. And they're both terrific people. I think the perception that Mr. Summers might have an inside track simply had to do with a bunch of attacks that I was hearing on Mr. Summers preemptively, which is sort of a standard Washington exercise, that I don't like. Because when somebody has worked hard for me and worked hard on behalf of the American people, and I know the quality of those people, and I see them getting slapped around in the press for no reason -- before they’ve even been nominated for anything -- then I want to make sure that somebody is standing up for them. I felt the same way when people were attacking Susan Rice before she was nominated for anything. So I tend to defend folks who I think have done a good job and don't deserve attacks. But I consider them both outstanding candidates. My main criteria -- I’ve stated this before, but I want to repeat it -- my main criteria for the Fed Reserve chairman is somebody who understands they’ve got a dual mandate. A critical part of the job is making sure that we keep inflation in check, that our monetary policy is sound, that the dollar is sound. Those are all critical components of the job. And we’ve seen what happens when the Fed is not paying attention. We saw, prior to Paul Volcker coming into place, inflation shooting up in ways that really damaged the real economy. But the other mandate is full employment. And right now, if you look at the biggest challenges we have, the challenge is not inflation; the challenge is we’ve still got too many people out of work, too many long-term unemployed, too much slack in the economy, and we’re not growing as fast as we should. And so I want a Fed chairman who’s able to look at those issues and have a perspective that keeps an eye on inflation, makes sure that we’re not seeing artificial bubbles in place, but also recognizing, you know what, a big part of my job right now is to make sure the economy is growing quickly and robustly, and is sustained and durable, so that people who work hard in this country are able to find a job. And, frankly, I think both Larry Summers and Janet Yellen are highly qualified candidates. There are a couple of other candidates who are highly qualified as well. I’ll make the decision in the fall.","Well, look, when you're talking about issues that have such a profound impact on the economic well-being of the American people, you expect a vigorous debate. That's part and parcel of a healthy democracy. Now, do I sometimes wish we could cut through some of the partisan noise and focus more directly on solutions that benefit everyone? Absolutely. But I also understand that people are passionately advocating for what they believe is best for their constituents and for the country.

As for whether I find it ""unseemly""... I see it as passion. Sometimes that passion leads to spirited disagreements, and yes, the rhetoric can occasionally get a little sharp. But my job, my responsibility, is to guide us through that process and to ensure we arrive at a resolution that serves the national interest. I'm focused on the outcome, not on the theatrics.

And to your final point: there is absolutely no doubt in my mind. The decisions we make now, on this very issue, will define the economic landscape for years, if not decades, to come. We are talking about the foundation for growth, for innovation, for job creation, and for the long-term prosperity of every single family in this country. So, yes, without question, this is one of the most consequential economic choices—if not *the* most consequential—that we will face during my time in office. We have to get it right."
 Can you see how the perception of you defending Larry Summers as vigorously as you just did and in other quarters lead some to believe you’ve already made up your mind? ,"Well, except I just told you I haven’t. Major, I’d defend you if somebody was saying something that wasn’t true about you. I really would. In fact, I’ve done that in the White House some times. Carol Lee. And, Carol, congratulations on Hudson.","Well, I appreciate you raising that concern, and I understand how, in the hurly-burly of Washington, perceptions can sometimes take hold. But let me be absolutely clear: my vigorous defense of Larry Summers – and it *was* vigorous, because I believe in his intellect and his deep experience – should not, in any way, shape, or form, be interpreted as a pre-judgment.

I've known Larry for a long time; I know his strengths, his incredible capacity for problem-solving, his understanding of the global economy. My job, right now, is to ensure that we have a robust and honest discussion about all potential candidates, to weigh their merits, to consider their criticisms, and to make the very best decision for the American people. And that means giving every qualified individual a fair hearing, and yes, sometimes defending their record against what I might see as unfair or incomplete attacks.

But the ultimate decision? That's still a process I'm deeply engaged in, listening to all sides, and I assure you, my mind remains entirely open. We're going to get this right, and we're going to do it fairly."
" Thank you, Mr. President. ",Do you have pictures?,"Well, thank *you* for that. It's truly an honor to serve this great nation of ours, and I appreciate your kind words. We've got important work to do, and I'm confident that together, we'll keep America strong and prosperous. God bless."
 I do. I’ll have to show you -- ,"Okay, I’m going to have to see them.","Alright, I'm ready to see it! That's what I like to hear – folks getting things done and ready to show their work. Always a good sign for this country."
" I appreciate you making it a slow news week. I wanted to ask you about your evolution on the surveillance issues. I mean, part of what you’re talking about today is restoring the public trust. And the public has seen you evolve from when you were in the U.S. Senate to now. And even as recently as June, you said that the process was such that people should be comfortable with it, and now you’re saying you’re making these reforms and people should be comfortable with those. So why should the public trust you on this issue, and why did you change your position multiple times? ","Well, I think it’s important to say, Carol, first of all, I haven’t evolved in my assessment of the actual programs. I consistently have said that when I came into office I evaluated them. Some of these programs I had been critical of when I was in the Senate. When I looked through specifically what was being done, my determination was that the two programs in particular that had been at issue, 215 and 702, offered valuable intelligence that helps us protect the American people and they're worth preserving. What we also saw was that some bolts needed to be tightened up on some of the programs, so we initiated some additional oversight, reforms, compliance officers, audits and so forth. And if you look at the reports -- even the disclosures that Mr. Snowden has put forward -- all the stories that have been written, what you're not reading about is the government actually abusing these programs and listening in on people's phone calls or inappropriately reading people's emails. What you're hearing about is the prospect that these could be abused. Now, part of the reason they're not abused is because these checks are in place, and those abuses would be against the law and would be against the orders of the FISC. Having said that, though, if you are outside of the intelligence community, if you are the ordinary person and you start seeing a bunch of headlines saying, U.S.-Big Brother looking down on you, collecting telephone records, et cetera, well, understandably, people would be concerned. I would be, too, if I wasn't inside the government. And so in light of the changed environment where a whole set of questions have been raised, some in the most sensationalized manner possible, where these leaks are released drip by drip, one a week, to kind of maximize attention and see if they can catch us at some imprecision on something -- in light of that, it makes sense for us to go ahead, lay out what exactly we're doing, have a discussion with Congress, have a discussion with industry -- which is also impacted by this -- have a discussion with civil libertarians, and see can we do this better. I think the main thing I want to emphasize is I don't have an interest and the people at the NSA don't have an interest in doing anything other than making sure that where we can prevent a terrorist attack, where we can get information ahead of time, that we're able to carry out that critical task. We do not have an interest in doing anything other than that. And we've tried to set up a system that is as failsafe as so far at least we've been able to think of to make sure that these programs are not abused. But people may have better ideas and people may want to jigger slightly sort of the balance between the information that we can get versus the incremental encroachments on privacy that if haven't already taken place might take place in a future administration, or as technologies develop further. And the other thing that’s happening is, is that as technology develops further, technology itself may provide us some additional safeguards. So, for example, if people don’t have confidence that the law, the checks and balances of the court and Congress are sufficient to give us confidence that government is not snooping, well, maybe we can embed technologies in there that prevent the snooping regardless of what government wants to do. I mean, there may be some technological fixes that provide another layer of assurance. And so those are the kinds of things that I’m looking forward to having a conversation about.","Well, look, I appreciate that question. It's a fair one, and it goes right to the heart of what we're talking about today: trust. My number one priority, my sacred duty, has always been, and will always be, the safety and security of the American people. Always.

Now, you talk about evolution, and that's an honest way to put it. When I was in the U.S. Senate, my role was different. I was a legislator, focused on frameworks, on the broad strokes, on ensuring the laws were sound. You have a certain vantage point from there. You're trying to balance many different interests, and you're not privy to every single piece of intelligence that crosses the desk of the Commander-in-Chief.

But when you sit in this chair, when you receive those daily intelligence briefings, when you have the weight of 300 million Americans on your shoulders, and you see the true nature of the threats we face – the enemies out there who plot against us, who want to do us harm – well, it changes your perspective. You see the *urgency* in a way you simply can't from the outside.

My core principles haven't changed: protecting our country and upholding our Constitution. What has evolved is the *how*. The world changes. The threats evolve. Technology advances at a lightning pace. And a responsible leader, a responsible government, *must* adapt. We must constantly assess, constantly review, constantly strive to do better.

When I said people should be comfortable with the process, I meant that the safeguards in place were significant. But good governance isn't static. It's a continuous process of improvement. We learn. We find areas where we can be more transparent, where we can add layers of oversight, where we can ensure even greater protections for our citizens' privacy, *without* compromising our ability to track down terrorists and criminals.

So, why should the public trust me? Because these reforms are not a sign of weakness or inconsistency. They are a sign of strength, of leadership, of a deep commitment to listen, to learn, and to adapt. They are proof that we are willing to constantly scrutinize ourselves, to make a good system even better. We're showing you that we can be both strong and secure, and open and accountable. That's what responsible leadership looks like. It's about protecting America, pure and simple."
" Can you understand, though, why some people might not trust what you're saying right now about wanting to -- ","No, I can’t.","Folks, I understand that. I really do. In a country as big and as vibrant as ours, with all the different opinions and, frankly, all the noise out there, it's natural for people to have questions. It's healthy, even, to be skeptical sometimes. You know, people have seen a lot of politicians come and go, they've heard a lot of promises, and sometimes things don't always turn out exactly as folks hoped. And that can make a person wary, can't it?

But let me tell you this, straight from the heart: my focus, my entire focus, is on doing what's right for the American people. We're talking about getting our economy roaring, making sure our families are safe, and upholding the values that make this nation the greatest on Earth. When I look you in the eye and tell you what we're going to do, it's because I believe it deeply, and it's because I know, with your help and God's help, we can achieve it. We're not playing political games here; we're talking about the future of our country. And I'm committed, absolutely committed, to delivering on that promise for every single American."
 -- that they should be comfortable with the process? ,"Well, the fact that I said that the programs are operating in a way that prevents abuse, that continues to be true, without the reforms. The question is how do I make the American people more comfortable. 0 If I tell Michelle that I did the dishes -- now, granted, in the White House I don’t do the dishes that much -- but back in the day -- and she’s a little skeptical, well, I’d like her to trust me, but maybe I need to bring her back and show her the dishes and not just have her take my word for it. And so the program is -- I am comfortable that the program currently is not being abused. I’m comfortable that if the American people examined exactly what was taking place, how it was being used, what the safeguards were, that they would say, you know what, these folks are following the law and doing what they say they’re doing. But it is absolutely true that with the expansion of technology -- this is an area that’s moving very quickly -- with the revelations that have depleted public trust, that if there are some additional things that we can do to build that trust back up, then we should do them. Jonathan Karl.","Well, look, when we talk about folks being comfortable with *the process*, whether it's our elections, how government works, or even just how we get things done as a nation, it all comes down to trust. It really does.

And how do you build trust? You build it with transparency. You make sure everything is out in the open, that the rules are clear, and that everybody plays by those rules. You build it with integrity – knowing that the people involved, the folks running the show, are honest and have the best interests of the American people at heart.

It's also about participation. When people feel like their voice matters, when they can show up, cast their ballot, or speak their mind, and know it's being heard, that's how comfort starts to build. It's knowing that this isn't just *their* process, it's *our* process, guided by the Constitution and those fundamental American values we all share.

So, for people to be comfortable, we gotta show 'em. We gotta demonstrate that the system works, that it's fair, and that it's designed to uphold the very principles that make this the greatest nation on Earth. That's how you get folks feeling good about it."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You have said that core al Qaeda has been decimated, that its leaders are on the run. Now that we’ve seen this terror threat that has resulted in embassies closed throughout the Arab world, much of Africa, do you still believe that al Qaeda has been decimated? And if I can ask in the interest of transparency, can you tell us about these drone strikes that we’ve seen over the last couple of weeks in Yemen? ","What I said in the same National Defense University speech back in May that I referred to earlier is that core al Qaeda is on its heels, has been decimated. But what I also said was that al Qaeda and other extremists have metastasized into regional groups that can pose significant dangers. And I’d refer you back to that speech just back in May where I said specifically that although they are less likely to be able to carry out spectacular homeland attacks like 9/11, they have the capacity to go after our embassies. They have the capacity, potentially, to go after our businesses. They have the capacity to be destabilizing and disruptive in countries where the security apparatus is weak. And that’s exactly what we are seeing right now. So it’s entirely consistent to say that this tightly organized and relatively centralized al Qaeda that attacked us on 9/11 has been broken apart and is very weak and does not have a lot of operational capacity, and to say we still have these regional organizations like AQAP that can pose a threat, that can drive potentially a truck bomb into an embassy wall and can kill some people. And so that requires us, then, to make sure that we have a strategy that is strengthening those partners so that they’ve got their own capacity to deal with what are potentially manageable regional threats if these countries are a little bit stronger and have more effective CT and so forth. 1 It means that we’ve got to continue to be vigilant and go after known terrorists who are potentially carrying out plots or are going to strengthen their capacity over time -- because they’re always testing the boundaries of, well, maybe we can try this, maybe we can do that. So this is a ongoing process. We are not going to completely eliminate terrorism. What we can do is to weaken it and to strengthen our partnerships in such a way that it does not pose the kind of horrible threat that we saw on 9/11. And I’m not going to discuss specific operations that have taken place. Again, in my speech in May, I was very specific about how we make these determinations about potential lethal strikes, so I would refer you to that speech.","Thank you for that important question. It's a fair one, and I appreciate the opportunity to address it directly.

Let me be absolutely clear: when we stated that core al Qaeda had been decimated, that was a statement of fact regarding the leadership responsible for 9/11 and the initial, centralized threat to our homeland. We dealt them a severe blow. Their ability to plan and execute large-scale attacks from a centralized command structure was profoundly disrupted. We took out many of their key leaders, and we made it extraordinarily difficult for them to operate as they once did.

However, we have always known that the war on terror is an evolving struggle. This enemy is not static. It adapts, it fragments, and it metastasizes. What we are seeing now is not the old al Qaeda operating from caves in Afghanistan, but rather a dangerous web of affiliates and adherents who draw inspiration from a hateful ideology. Groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, in Yemen, are a very real and dangerous threat, and we take them very, very seriously. They seek to exploit instability, they recruit, and they continue to plot against American interests and our allies.

The recent actions we've taken, including the temporary closure of embassies and consulates across the Arab world and parts of Africa, are not a sign of weakness or a failure of strategy. On the contrary, they are a sign of our vigilance and our commitment to protecting American lives. These were proactive, necessary measures based on credible intelligence. We will always err on the side of caution when it comes to the safety of our diplomats and our citizens abroad. It demonstrates that our intelligence agencies are working, that we are tracking these threats, and that we are responding decisively.

Now, regarding the operations you mentioned in Yemen over the past couple of weeks. I will not, and cannot, get into the specifics of ongoing intelligence operations or classified missions from this podium. But what I can tell you, in the interest of transparency, is this: the United States of America will take resolute action, working closely with our partners, to disrupt terrorist plots and to protect our nation and our people. We utilize every tool at our disposal – intelligence gathering, diplomatic efforts, economic pressure, and, when absolutely necessary, targeted, precise military action – to keep Americans safe.

These operations are carefully considered, they are lawful, and they are designed to go after those who plot to kill Americans and our allies. We are relentless in our pursuit of those who would do us harm, wherever they may hide. Our message to terrorists remains unwavering: we will find you, and we will hold you accountable. We will not relent until this threat is contained and defeated. Thank you."
 So you won’t even confirm that we carried out drone strikes in Yemen? ,I will not have a discussion about operational issues. Ed Henry.,"Look, my primary responsibility, above all else, is the safety and security of the American people. And let me be absolutely clear: when it comes to confronting terrorism and those who seek to do us harm, whether they're in Yemen or anywhere else in the world, we will use every necessary tool at our disposal to protect our nation and our allies.

Now, as for specific operational details or intelligence matters in sensitive regions, it would be irresponsible for me to confirm or deny every report or speculation from this podium. We simply do not discuss ongoing operations or intelligence activities publicly. Our adversaries are always listening, and we will not give them information that could compromise our personnel, our methods, or our efforts to keep America safe. We are vigilant, we are active, and we will continue to pursue those who threaten us, wherever they may be hiding."
 I hope you would defend me as well. ,I would.,"Well, look, the very oath I took, and what every President is sworn to do, is to protect and defend the Constitution and the American people. That means *all* Americans. You can be darn sure that protecting our citizens, upholding their rights, and ensuring our national security is the most serious responsibility there is. Absolutely. It's fundamental."
" Okay, thank you. I want to ask you about two important dates that are coming up. October 1st you’ve got to implement your signature health care law. You recently decided on your own to delay a key part of that. And I wonder, if you pick and choose what parts of the law to implement, couldn’t your successor down the road pick and choose whether they’ll implement your law and keep it in place? And on September 11th we’ll have the first anniversary of Benghazi. And you said on September 12th, “Make no mistake, we’ll bring to justice the killers who attacked our people.” Eleven months later, where are they, sir? ","Well, I also said that we’d get bin Laden, and I didn’t get him in 11 months. So we have informed, I think, the public that there’s a sealed indictment. It’s sealed for a reason. But we are intent on capturing those who carried out this attack, and we’re going to stay on it until we get them.","Alright, thank you for those questions. Let's take them one at a time.

First, on the healthcare law. You're right, October 1st is a big day, and this administration is committed to making sure this law works for the American people. Now, regarding the adjustments we've made, specifically the delay for the employer mandate – look, when you're implementing something of this magnitude, something that touches every single American and thousands upon thousands of businesses, you're going to encounter real-world challenges. My job, my administration's job, is to be pragmatic. It's about common sense. We made that decision to give businesses, particularly small businesses, more time to prepare, to make sure the transition is smooth, and to help them avoid unintended consequences that could hurt jobs and hurt our economy. This isn't about picking and choosing which parts of the law to ignore; it's about making practical, necessary adjustments to ensure the law is implemented effectively and fairly. Any good leader, any responsible administration, makes these kinds of adjustments when faced with the realities on the ground. A successor, down the road, will have their own set of challenges, and they'll have to make their own decisions under the law, guided by what's best for the country. My focus is on getting this right for the American people, today.

Now, on to Benghazi. You are absolutely right. On September 12th, I said we would bring to justice those who attacked our people. Let me be unequivocally clear: that commitment has not wavered, not for one second. The loss of Ambassador Stevens and three other brave Americans was a tragedy, and it was an act of terror. We are working relentlessly. These types of international investigations, pursuing terrorists across borders, are incredibly complex. They involve intelligence gathering, working with foreign partners, and intricate operations. We are not going to telegraph our movements, but make no mistake, our intelligence agencies, our law enforcement, our military – they are working around the clock. We are pursuing every lead, and we will hold those responsible accountable. Justice will be served. Period. This country does not forget its fallen, and we will see this through."
 And you’re close to having suspects in custody? ,"I will leave it at that. But this remains a top priority for us. Anybody who attacks Americans, anybody who kills, tragically, four Americans who were serving us in a very dangerous place, we’re going to do everything we can to get those who carried out those attacks. 2 With respect to health care, I didn’t simply choose to delay this on my own. This was in consultation with businesses all across the country, many of whom are supportive of the Affordable Care Act, but -- and many of whom, by the way, are already providing health insurance to their employees but were concerned about the operational details of changing their HR operations, if they’ve got a lot of employees, which could be costly for them, and them suggesting that there may be easier ways to do this. Now, what’s true, Ed, is, is that in a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the Speaker and say, you know what, this is a tweak that doesn’t go to the essence of the law -- it has to do with, for example, are we able to simplify the attestation of employers as to whether they’re already providing health insurance or not -- it looks like there may be some better ways to do this; let's make a technical change to the law. That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do. But we're not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to ""Obamacare."" We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did so. But this doesn't go to the core of implementation. Let me tell you what is the core of implementation that's already taken place. As we speak, right now, for the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, they are benefiting from being able to keep their kid on their plan if their kid is 26 or younger. That's benefiting millions of young people around the country, which is why lack of insurance among young people has actually gone down. That's in large part attributable to the steps that we've taken. You've got millions of people who have received rebates, because part of the Affordable Care Act was to say that if an insurance company isn't spending 80 percent of your premium on your health care, you get some money back. And, lo and behold, people have been getting their money back. It means that folks who have been bumping up with lifetime limits on their insurance, that it leaves them vulnerable. That doesn't exist. Seniors have been getting discounts on their prescription drugs. That's happening right now. Free preventive care -- mammograms, contraception. That's happening right now. I met a young man today on a bill signing I was doing with the student loan bill who came up to me and said thank you -- he couldn't have been more than 25, 26 years old -- thank you; I have cancer, thanks to the Affordable Care Act working with the California program, I was able to get health care and I'm now in remission. And so right now people are already benefiting. Now, what happens on October 1st, in 53 days, is for the remaining 15 percent of the population that doesn’t have health insurance, they're going to be able to go on a website or call up a call center and sign up for affordable quality health insurance at a significantly cheaper rate than what they can get right now on the individual market. And if even with lower premiums they still can't afford it, we're going to be able to provide them with a tax credit to help them buy it. And between October 1st into March there will be an open enrollment period in which millions of Americans for the first time are going to be able to get affordable health care. 3 Now, I think the really interesting question is why it is that my friends in the other party have made the idea of preventing these people from getting health care their holy grail, their number-one priority. The one unifying principle in the Republican Party at the moment is making sure that 30 million people don't have health care and, presumably, repealing all those benefits I just mentioned -- kids staying on their parents' plan; seniors getting discounts on their prescription drugs; I guess a return to lifetime limits on insurance; people with preexisting conditions continuing to be blocked from being able to get health insurance. That's hard to understand as an agenda that is going to strengthen our middle class. At least they used to say, well, we're going to replace it with something better. There’s not even a pretense now that they're going to replace it with something better. The notion is simply that those 30 million people, or the 150 million who are benefiting from the other aspects of Affordable Care, will be better off without it. That's their assertion -- not backed by fact, not backed by any evidence. It’s just become an ideological fixation. Well, I tell you what, they're wrong about that. There is no doubt that in implementing the Affordable Care Act, a program of this significance, there are going to be some glitches. No doubt about it. There are going to be things where we say, you know what, we should have thought of that earlier. Or this would work a little bit better. Or this needs an adjustment. That was true of Social Security. That was true of Medicare. That was true of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. That was true of the prescription drug program, Part D, that was rolled out by a Republican President and supported by Republicans who are still in the House of Representatives. That's true, by the way, of a car company rolling out a new car. It’s true of Apple rolling out the new iPad. So you will be able to, whenever you want during the course of the next six months and probably the next year, find occasions where you say, ah-ha, you know what, that could have been done a little bit better. Or that thing, they're kind of making an administrative change; that's now how it was originally thought this thing was going to work. Yes, exactly. Because our goal is to actually deliver high-quality, affordable health care for people and to reform the system so costs start going down and people start getting a better bang for the buck. And I make no apologies for that. And let me just make one last point about this. The idea that you would shut down the government unless you prevent 30 million people from getting health care is a bad idea. What you should be thinking about is how can we advance and improve ways for middle-class families to have some security so that if they work hard, they can get ahead and their kids can get ahead. Jessica Yellin. 4","Well, let me tell you, our incredible men and women in law enforcement – federal, state, local – they are working tirelessly, around the clock. I've been briefed, and I have full confidence in their efforts. We are making significant progress, and they are doing an outstanding job to identify and apprehend those responsible. We will bring them to justice. Believe me."
" Thank you, Mr. President. And following on what you just said, Republicans in the House might give you that choice soon to either allow the government to shut down or see Obamacare defunded. Would you choose to let the government shut down to ensure that Obamacare remains funded? ","Well, I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals. I can tell you that the American people would have difficulty understanding why we would weaken our economy, shut down our government, shut down vital services, have people who are not getting paid who then can't go to restaurants or shop for clothes, or all the other things that we’re doing here because Republicans have determined that they don't want to see these folks get health care. Again, they used to say they had a replacement. That never actually arrived, right? I mean, I’ve been hearing about this whole replacement thing for two years -- now I just don’t hear about it, because basically they don’t have an agenda to provide health insurance to people at affordable rates. And the idea that you would shut down the government at a time when the recovery is getting some traction; where we’re growing, although not as fast as we need to; where the housing market is recovering, although not as fast as we would like; that we would precipitate another crisis here in Washington that no economist thinks is a good idea -- I’m assuming that they will not take that path. I have confidence that common sense, in the end, will prevail.","Thank you for that question. Let's be very clear about something right upfront: My administration has always been committed to responsible governance, and that means avoiding unnecessary disruptions to the American people. A government shutdown is something we always work to avoid, because it hurts our citizens and creates instability.

However, the premise of your question suggests a choice I simply wouldn't make. The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is a deeply flawed law. It's an overreach of federal power that has driven up costs, limited choices, and left too many families and small businesses struggling to afford decent healthcare. We have seen firsthand that it's not working for the American people.

My commitment, and the commitment of my administration, has always been to repeal and replace Obamacare with market-based solutions that empower patients, reduce costs, and restore choice. We want a healthcare system where Americans are in control, not Washington bureaucrats.

So, to answer your question directly: I would absolutely *not* choose to let the government shut down *to ensure Obamacare remains funded*. That would run entirely counter to the principles I stand for and the promises I've made to the American people. We need to work with Congress to fund the vital functions of our government, yes, but we also need to address the fundamental problems with our healthcare system. We need real reform, and we need it now."
" And if they do, sir, you will have to make that choice? ",We’ll see what happens. We’ve got a couple of months.,"Well, look, the weight of this office is undeniable. And when faced with such difficult circumstances, when the nation's security, our values, our very way of life are on the line, there is no greater responsibility.

So, yes, if that day comes, I will make that choice. It's what the American people expect, and it's what I am sworn to do. You can be absolutely certain of that."
 When’s the last time you spoke to Speaker Boehner about the budget? ,"Fairly recently, yes. Probably right before they left. Okay. Scott Horseley.","Well, son, Speaker Boehner, bless his heart, he wasn't holding that gavel when I was in the Oval Office. He became Speaker a little after my time.

When I was President, we were working with folks like Speaker Hastert and Speaker Pelosi on the budget. So, I never had a budget conversation with Speaker Boehner directly as President. Good man, though, I hear. Lots of folks liked him."
" Thank you, Mr. President. The combination of the website problems and the concerns over the policy cancellations has sparked a lot of worry within your own party, and polls also show that you’re taking some hits with the public on both your overall job approval rating and also on factors like trust and honesty. Do you feel as though the flawed health care rollout has led to a breach in the public trust and confidence in government? And if so, how do you plan to resolve that? ","There is no doubt that people are frustrated. We just came out of a shutdown and the possibility that for the first time in over 200 years, we wouldn’t pay our bills. And people breathed a sigh of relief when that finally got done, and the next thing they know is, is that the President’s health care reform can’t get the website to work and that there are these other problems with respect to cancellation notices. And I understand why folks are frustrated. I would be, too. Because sometimes people look at what’s taking place in Washington and they say, not enough is getting done that helps me with my life. And regardless of what Congress does, ultimately I’m the President of the United States and they expect me to do something about it. So in terms of how I intend to approach it, I’m just going to keep on working as hard as I can around the priorities that the American people care about. And I think it’s legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular, and on a whole range of these issues in general. And that’s on me. I mean, we fumbled the rollout on this health care law. There are a whole bunch of things about it that are working really well which people didn’t notice because they weren’t controversial -- so making sure kids could stay on their parents’ plans until they were -- through the age of 25, and making sure that seniors got more discounts on their prescription drugs. There were a whole bunch of stuff that we did well over the first three years. But we always knew that these marketplaces, creating a place where people can shop and through competition get a better deal for the health insurance that their families need, we always knew that that was going to be complicated and everybody was going to be paying a lot of attention to it. And we should have done a better job getting that right on day one -- not on day 28 or on day 40. I am confident that by the time we look back on this next year, that people are going to say this is working well, and it’s helping a lot of people. But my intention in terms of winning back the confidence of the American people is just to work as hard as I can; identify the problems that we’ve got, make sure that we’re fixing them. Whether it’s a website, whether it is making sure that folks who got these cancellation notices get help, we’re just going to keep on chipping away at this until the job is done. Major Garrett.","Well, thank you for that question. And let me tell you, there’s no doubt in my mind that when the American people are promised one thing, especially when it comes to something as vital as their family's healthcare, and then they experience broken websites, cancelled policies, and rising costs – yes, absolutely, that hits trust. It absolutely creates a breach of confidence in government. And frankly, it should.

This isn't just about a few technical glitches, although those are certainly frustrating. This is about a system that was designed in Washington, with too much government intrusion, and it's simply not delivering for the people. When folks are losing the plans they liked, the plans they were told they could keep, and then they're forced into a system that’s confusing and unaffordable, that’s a real problem. And it's a problem that affects real families, real pocketbooks.

How do we resolve it? We resolve it by being honest with the American people about what went wrong. We resolve it by listening to their concerns, not just dismissing them. And we resolve it by getting back to principles that truly empower individuals and families, not bureaucrats in Washington.

My plan to resolve this would be clear: We need to put patients and doctors back in charge, not the federal government. We need to foster competition, lower costs through the free market, and ensure that people have choices that actually work for them, not mandates that dictate what they must buy. We need transparency, so people know what they're paying for.

You don't restore trust by doubling down on a failed approach. You restore it by admitting mistakes, by changing course, and by putting common-sense, market-based solutions into action that actually deliver quality care and affordability for every American. That's how we rebuild confidence."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You said while the law was being debated, “if you like your plan, you can keep it.” You said after the law was implemented or signed, “if you like your plan, you can keep it.” Americans believed you, sir, when you said that to them over and over. Do you not believe, sir, the American people deserve a deeper, more transparent accountability from you as to why you said that over and over when your own statistic published in the Federal Register alerted your policy staff -- and I presume you -- to the fact that millions of Americans would, in fact, probably fall into the very gap you’re trying to administratively fix now? That's one question. Second question. (Laughter.) You were informed, or several people in this building were informed two weeks before the launch of the website that it was failing the most basic tests internally, and yet a decision was made to launch the website on October 1st. Did you, sir, make that test? And if so, did you regret that? ","Okay, on the website, I was not informed directly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to. Had I been informed, I wouldn’t be going out saying, boy, this is going to be great. I’m accused of a lot of things, but I don't think I’m stupid enough to go around saying, this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity a week before the website opens if I thought that it wasn’t going to work. So clearly, we and I did not have enough awareness about the problems in the website. Even a week into it, the thinking was that these were some glitches that would be fixed with patches, as opposed to some broader systemic problems that took much longer to fix and we’re still working on them. So that doesn't excuse the fact that they just don't work. But I think it’s fair to say that, no, Garrett -- Major, we would not have rolled out something knowing very well that it wasn’t going to work the way it was supposed, given all the scrutiny that we knew was going to be on the website. With respect to the pledge I made that if you like your plan, you can keep it, I think -- and I’ve said in interviews -- that there is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate. It was not because of my intention not to deliver on that commitment and that promise. We put a grandfather clause into the law, but it was insufficient. Keep in mind that the individual market accounts for 5 percent of the population. So when I said you can keep your health care, I’m looking at folks who’ve got employer-based health care; I’m looking at folks who’ve got Medicare and Medicaid -- and that accounts for the vast majority of Americans. And then for people who don't have any health insurance at all, obviously that didn't apply. My commitment to them was, you're going to be able to get affordable health care for the first time. You have an individual market that accounts for about 5 percent of the population. And our working assumption was -- my working assumption was that the majority of those folks would find better policies at lower costs or the same costs in the marketplaces, and that the universe of folks who potentially would not find a better deal in the marketplaces, the grandfather clause would work sufficiently for them. And it didn't. And again, that's on us. Which is why we’re -- that's on me. And that's why I’m trying to fix it. And as I said earlier, I guess last week, and I will repeat, that's something I deeply regret because it’s scary getting a cancellation notice. Now, it is important to understand that out of that population, typically there is constant churn in that market. This market is not very stable and reliable for people. So people have a lot of complaints when they're in that marketplace. As long as you're healthy, things seem to be going pretty good. And so a lot of people think, I’ve got pretty good insurance -- until they get sick -- and then suddenly they look at the fine print, and they’ve got a $50,000 out- of-pocket expense that they can't pay. We know that on average over the last decade, each year, premiums in that individual market would go up an average of 15 percent a year. I know that because when we were talking about health care reform, one of the complaints was: I bought health care in the individual market and I just got a notice from the insurer, they dropped me after I had an illness; or my premium skyrocketed by 20 or 30 percent, why aren’t we doing something about this? So part of what our goal has been is to make sure that that individual market is stable and fair, and has the kind of consumer protections that make sure that people don’t get a rude surprise when they really need health insurance. But if you just got a cancellation notice, and so far you’re thinking, my prices are pretty good, you haven’t been sick, and it fits your budget, and now you get this notice -- you’re going to be worried about it. And if the insurer is saying the reason you’re getting this notice is because of the Affordable Care Act, then you’re going to be understandably aggravated about it. Now, for a big portion of those people, the truth is they might have gotten a notice saying, we’re jacking up your rates by 30 percent. They might have said, from here on out, we’re not going to cover X, Y and Z illnesses, we’re changing the -- because these were all 12-month policies. The insurance companies were under no obligation to renew the exact same policies that you had before. But, look, one of the things I understood when we decided to reform that health insurance market, part of the reason why it hasn’t been done before and it’s very difficult to do, is that anything that’s going on that’s tough in the health care market, if you initiated a reform, can be attributed to your law. And so what we want to do is to be able to say to these folks, you know what, the Affordable Care Act is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan. Now, what folks may find is the insurance companies may still come back and say, we want to charge you 20 percent more than we did last year; or we’re not going to cover prescription drugs now. But that’s in the nature of the market that existed earlier.","(Standing at the podium, looking directly at the questioner, a slight pause before answering)

""Well, son, those are two very direct questions, and I appreciate you asking them. Let's talk about that first point, because it really did strike at the trust folks put in their government: the promise, 'if you like your plan, you can keep it.' Now, look, the American people *were* told that, over and over again, and they had every right to believe it. And when millions of hardworking Americans found out their plans *were* cancelled, their doctors were changed, and their premiums went up, well, that was a profound disappointment.

My view, and the view of many, is that the very design of that massive healthcare law—the mandates, the regulations, the federal takeover of the insurance market—made that promise, frankly, impossible to keep. You see, when you impose a top-down, government-driven system, it inevitably disrupts what folks have and what they like. Accountability, in my book, comes from acknowledging that you can't build a new system that dictates so much change and simultaneously guarantee no one will be affected. We need real, market-based healthcare reform that puts patients and doctors in charge, not Washington.

Now, as for that website, that launch on October 1st... let me be very clear: that decision to launch a failing system, one that clearly hadn't been properly tested, that wasn't on my watch. That was a decision made by the previous administration, and it was, without question, an embarrassing and costly failure. Did *I* regret it? You bet I did, for the American people who were trying to get basic healthcare information and found nothing but frustration and error messages. It was a stark example of a government bureaucracy that simply wasn't competent or ready to deliver on such a monumental promise.

My administration, we believe in competence, we believe in transparency, and we believe in empowering individuals and families, not bureaucrats in Washington. We need to be focused on solutions that expand choice and lower costs, not broken promises and failing websites."""
" Did you decide, sir, that the simple declaration was something the American people could handle, but this nuanced answer you just gave now was something that you couldn’t handle and you didn’t trust the American people with a fuller truth? ","No. I think, as I said earlier, Major, my expectation was that for 98 percent of the American people, either it genuinely wouldn't change at all, or they'd be pleasantly surprised with the options in the marketplace, and that the grandfather clause would cover the rest. That proved not to be the case. And that's on me. And the American people -- those who got cancellation notices do deserve and have received an apology from me. But they don't want just words. What they want is whether we can make sure that they are in a better place, and that we meet that commitment. And, by the way, I think it's very important for me to note that there are a whole bunch of folks up in Congress and others who made this statement, and they were entirely sincere about it. And the fact that you've got this percentage of people who have had this impact -- I want them to know that their senator or congressman, they were making representations based on what I told them and what this White House and our administrative staff told them. And so it's not on them. It's on us. But it is something that we intend to fix. Steve Collinson.","Now, hold on a minute there. Let me be absolutely clear about something: I have *always* trusted the American people. They are the smartest, most resilient folks on God's green earth, and they can handle the truth. That's never been in question.

My job, first and foremost, especially in moments of uncertainty or when a situation is rapidly unfolding, is to provide clarity, stability, and a clear direction. Sometimes, that means offering a straightforward declaration – the essential truth, the ""what you need to know *right now*"" – so folks aren't overwhelmed by every single detail, every evolving piece of intelligence, or every potential ""what if.""

Leadership, you see, isn't about dumping every raw piece of data on people's laps at once. It's about distilling the crucial information, giving them what they need to understand the situation, to feel secure, and to know their government is acting decisively. As events progress, as more facts become definitively established, then we can – and we *always* do – delve into the deeper layers, the nuances, and the fuller picture. It's a process of responsible communication, not one of withholding. It's about giving the American people what they need, when they need it, in a way that serves their best interests. And I'd never doubt their ability to handle any of it."
" Do you have reason to believe that Iran would walk away from nuclear talks if Congress draws up new sanctions? And would a diplomatic breakdown at this stage leave you no option but military action? And how do you respond to your critics on the Hill who say that it was only tough sanctions that got Iran to the table, but only tougher sanctions will make it capitulate? ","Well, let me make a couple of points. Number one, I've said before and I will repeat: We do not want Iran having nuclear weapons. And it would be not only dangerous to us and our allies, but it would be destabilizing to the entire region, and could trigger a nuclear arms race that would make life much more dangerous for all of us. So our policy is Iran cannot have nuclear weapons. And I'm leaving all options on the table to make sure that we meet that goal. Point number two: The reason we've got such vigorous sanctions is because I and my administration put in place, when I came into office, the international structure to have the most effective sanctions ever. And so I think it's fair to say that I know a little bit about sanctions, since we've set them up, and made sure that we mobilize the entire international community so that there weren't a lot of loopholes and they really had bite. And the intention in setting up those sanctions always was to bring the Iranians to the table so that we could resolve this issue peacefully, because that is my preference. That's my preference because any armed conflict has cost to it, but it's also my preference because the best way to assure that a country does not have nuclear weapons is that they are making a decision not to have nuclear weapons, and we're in a position to verify that they don't have nuclear weapons. So as a consequence of the sanctions that we put in place -- and I appreciate all the help, bipartisan help, that we received from Congress in making that happen -- Iran's economy has been crippled. They had a -5 percent growth rate last year. Their currency plummeted. They're having significant problems in just the day-to-day economy on the ground in Iran. And President Rouhani made a decision that he was prepared to come and have a conversation with the international community about what they could do to solve this problem with us. We've now had a series of conversations, and it has never been realistic that we would resolve the entire problem all at once. What we have done is seen the possibility of an agreement in which Iran would halt advances on its program; that it would dilute some of the highly enriched uranium that makes it easier for them to potentially produce a weapon; that they are subjecting themselves to much more vigorous inspections so that we know exactly what they’re doing at all their various facilities; and that that would then provide time and space for us to test, over a certain period of months, whether or not they are prepared to actually resolve this issue to the satisfaction of the international community -- making us confident that, in fact, they’re not pursuing a nuclear weapons program. In return, the basic structure of what’s been talked about, although not completed, is that we would provide very modest relief at the margins of the sanctions that we’ve set up. But importantly, we would leave in place the core sanctions that are most effective and have most impact on the Iranian economy, specifically oil sanctions and sanctions with respect to banks and financing. And what that gives us is the opportunity to test how serious are they, but it also gives us an assurance that if it turns out six months from now that they’re not serious, we can crank -- we can dial those sanctions right back up. So my message to Congress has been that, let’s see if this short-term, phase-one deal can be completed to our satisfaction where we’re absolutely certain that while we’re talking with the Iranians, they’re not busy advancing their program. We can buy some additional months in terms of their breakout capacity. Let’s test how willing they are to actually resolve this diplomatically and peacefully. We will have lost nothing if, at the end of the day, it turns out that they are not prepared to provide the international community the hard proof and assurances necessary for us to know that they’re not pursuing a nuclear weapon. And if that turns out to be the case, then not only is our entire sanctions infrastructure still in place, not only are they still losing money from the fact that they can’t sell their oil and get revenue from their oil as easily, even throughout these talks, but other options remain. But what I’ve said to members of Congress is that if, in fact, we’re serious about trying to resolve this diplomatically -- because no matter how good our military is, military options are always messy, they’re always difficult, always have unintended consequences, and in this situation are never complete in terms of making us certain that they don’t then go out and pursue even more vigorously nuclear weapons in the future -- if we’re serious about pursuing diplomacy, then there’s no need for us to add new sanctions on top of the sanctions that are already very effective and that brought them to the table in the first place. Now, if it turns out they can’t deliver, they can’t come to the table in a serious way and get this issue resolved, the sanctions can be ramped back up. And we’ve got that option. All right. Roger Runningen. Roger, it’s his birthday, by the way. So that’s not the reason you got a question, but I thought it was important to note that.","Well, look, these are serious questions, and they deserve serious answers. We're dealing with a regime in Tehran that has a long history of malign behavior, and they've got to understand the gravity of the choices before them.

Now, when it comes to Congress drawing up new sanctions, let me be very clear: sanctions are a vital tool in our arsenal. They're designed to put pressure on the Iranian regime, to limit their ability to fund terrorism, to develop ballistic missiles, and most importantly, to prevent them from ever acquiring a nuclear weapon. If Iran chooses to walk away from the negotiating table because of increased pressure, that's a choice *they* make. And it sends a very strong message to the world about their true intentions. Our goal here isn't just to talk; it's to secure a verifiable and comprehensive deal that protects American national security and our allies in the region. We will use every tool available to achieve that.

On the question of a diplomatic breakdown leaving no option but military action, I've always said, and I will always say, that all options remain on the table. No president, certainly not this one, ever wants to rush to conflict. Diplomacy is always our preferred path. But let me be unambiguous: the United States of America will never allow the Iranian regime to develop a nuclear weapon. That is a red line. And if diplomacy fails to secure that outcome, if the Iranian regime continues to pursue its dangerous ambitions, then as President, I have a solemn duty to protect the American people and our interests. We will do what is necessary. But let's work hard for diplomacy first, with strength behind it.

And to my critics on the Hill who say tough sanctions got Iran to the table, and only tougher sanctions will make them capitulate, well, they're not wrong that sanctions are incredibly effective. We've seen that. Pressure works. It's a testament to American resolve and our economic power. But let's remember, sanctions are a means to an end. The end is a secure, verifiable, and lasting agreement that prevents a nuclear Iran. Diplomacy, backed by that pressure, is how you achieve a deal that lasts, a deal that truly changes the Iranian regime's behavior, not just forces them into a temporary pause. We need both. We need the steel-hard resolve of sanctions, and we need the strategic finesse of diplomacy to turn that pressure into a concrete, enforceable outcome. We are not interested in capitulation for its own sake, but in a durable solution that safeguards our national security for generations to come."
" Thank you, Mr. President. ",Happy birthday.,"You are most welcome. It's my honor to serve this great nation, and I appreciate your kind words. We're going to keep America strong and prosperous, believe me. Keep up the good work out there."
" Back to health care. Can you guarantee for the American people that the health care website is going to be fully operational for all people, not just the vast majority, by November 30? And second, more broadly, this is your signature domestic piece of legislation. You hear criticism on the Hill that you and your White House team are too insular. Is that how this mess came to be? ","Well, I think there is going to be a lot of evaluation of how we got to this point. And I assure you that I’ve been asking a lot of questions about that. The truth is that this is, number one, very complicated. The website itself is doing a lot of stuff. There aren’t a lot of websites out there that have to help people compare their possible insurance options, verify income to find out what kind of tax credits they might get, communicate with those insurance companies so they can purchase, make sure that all of it’s verified. So there’s just a bunch of pieces to it that made it challenging. And you combine that with the fact that the federal government does a lot of things really well. One of the things it does not do well is information technology procurement. This is kind of a systematic problem that we have across the board. And it is not surprising then that there were going to be some problems. Now, I think we have to ask ourselves some hard questions inside the White House as opposed to why we didn't see more of these problems coming earlier on -- A, so we could set expectations; B, so that we could look for different ways for people to end up applying. 0 So ultimately, you’re right. This is something that's really important to me, and it’s really important to millions of Americans who have been waiting for a really long time to try to get health care because they don't have it. And I am very frustrated, but I’m also somebody who, if I fumbled the ball, I’m going to wait until I get the next play, and then I’m going to try to run as hard as I can and do right by the team. So ultimately, I’m the head of this team. We did fumble the ball on it, and what I’m going to do is make sure that we get it fixed. In terms of what happens on November 30th or December 1st, I think it’s fair to say that the improvement will be marked and noticeable. The website will work much better on November 30th, December 1st than it worked certainly on October 1st. That's a pretty low bar. It will be working a lot better than it is -- it was last week, and it will be working better than it was this week, which means that the majority of people who go to the website will see a website that is working the way it’s supposed to. I think it is not possible for me to guarantee that 100 percent of the people 100 percent of the time going on this website will have a perfectly seamless, smooth experience. We’re going to have to continue to improve it even after November 30th, December 1st. But the majority of people who use it will be able to see it operate the way it was supposed to. One thing that we’ve discovered, though, that I think is worth noting: A lot of focus has been on the website and the technology, and that's partly because that's how we initially identified it -- these are glitches. What we’re discovering is that part of the problem has been technology -- hardware and software -- and that's being upgraded. But even if we get the hardware and software working exactly the way it’s supposed to with relatively minor glitches, what we’re also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy. And another mistake that we made I think was underestimating the difficulties of people purchasing insurance online and shopping for a lot of options with a lot of costs and a lot of different benefits and plans, and somehow expecting that that would be very smooth. And then they’ve also got to try apply for tax credits on the website. So what we’re doing even as we’re trying to solve the technical problems is also what can we do to make the application a little bit simpler; what can we do to make it in English as opposed to bureaucratese; are there steps that we can skip while still getting the core information that people need And part of what we’re realizing is that they are going to be a certain portion of people who are just going to need more help and more handholding in the application process. And so I guess part of the continuous improvement that I’m looking at is not just a technical issue. It’s also, can we streamline the application process; what are we doing to give people more assistance in the application process; how do the call centers and the people who are helping folks in-person; how are they trained so that things can go more smoothly. 1 Because the bottom line ultimately is, I just want people to know what their options are in a clear way. And buying health insurance is never going to be like buying a song on iTunes. It’s just a much more complicated transaction. But I think we can continue to make it better - - all of which is to say that on December 1st, November 30th, it will be a lot better, but there will still be some problems. Some of those will not be because of technological problems -- although I’m sure that there will still be some glitches that have to be smoothed out. Some of it’s going to be how are we making this application process more user-friendly for folks. And one good example of this, by the way, just to use an analogy -- when we came into office, we heard a lot of complaints about the financial aid forms that families have to fill out to get federal financial aid. And I actually remember applying for some of that stuff and remember how difficult and confusing it was. And Arne Duncan over at Education worked with a team to see what we could do to simplify it, and it made a big difference. And that's part of the process that we’ve got to go through. And in fact, if we can get some focus groups and we sit down with actual users and see how well is this working, what would improve it, what part of it didn't you understand -- that all I think is part of what we’re going to be working on in the weeks ahead.","Alright, let's talk about healthcare. Believe me, nobody understands healthcare better than I do.

First, on that website, the one you're talking about, that was a disaster. A complete and total catastrophe. People couldn't even log on, they couldn't sign up. They said it was supposed to be the best, the easiest, it was a joke. And let's be very clear, that was *their* website, the other side's. Not ours. When *we* do things, when *I* do things, they work. We build things that are phenomenal, the best. So, to guarantee a broken system, a failed system, by some artificial date? That's not how we do business. We fix the problems, we don't just put a bandage on them. We're going to have the greatest healthcare, the most affordable, nobody's ever seen anything like it. And it'll actually work, believe me.

And second, this idea that we're ""insular""? That's just more of the same nonsense from Washington. We have the best people, the most talented people, truly incredible individuals working day and night for the American people. Nobody works harder. We're doing things that nobody thought possible – historic tax cuts, deregulation, bringing back jobs, rebuilding our military. We're winning so much, frankly, we're getting tired of winning.

When you're making this kind of progress, when you're disrupting the swamp, they're always going to throw mud. It's what they do. But we're not listening to the swamp; we're listening to the American people. The people who elected me, the people who want to see results, not just talk. We're focused, we're smart, and we're getting the job done. So, ""insular""? No, we're just very effective. Very, very effective."
 What about the insularity criticism that you hear on the Hill? ,"I’ve got to say I meet with an awful lot of folks, and I talk to an awful lot of folks every day. And I have lunches with CEOs and IT venture capitalists and labor leaders and pretty much folks from all walks of life on a whole bunch of topics. And if you looked at my schedule on any given day, we’re interacting with a whole lot of people. And I think it’s fair to say that we have a pretty good track record of working with folks on technology and IT from our campaign where, both in 2008 and 2012, we did a pretty darn good job on that. So it’s not -- the idea that somehow we didn't have access or were interested in people’s ideas, I think isn’t accurate. What is true is that, as I said before, our IT systems, how we purchase technology in the federal government is cumbersome, complicated, and outdated. And so this isn’t a situation where on my campaign I could simply say, who are the best folks out there; let’s get them around a table, let’s figure out what we’re doing, and we’re just going to continue to improve it and refine it and work on our goals. If you're doing it at the federal government level, you're going through 40 pages of specs and this and that and the other, and there are all kinds of laws involved, and it makes it more difficult. It's part of the reason why, chronically, federal IT programs are over budget, behind schedule. And one of the -- when I do some Monday morning quarterbacking on myself, one of the things that I do recognize is -- since I know that the federal government has not been good at this stuff in the past -- two years ago, as we were thinking about this, we might have done 2 more to make sure that we were breaking the mold on how we were going to be setting this up. But that doesn't help us now. We've got to move forward. Jeff Mason.","Believe me, I hear it, and it's a big problem, a really big problem. This idea that people on the Hill, some of them, frankly, they get so wrapped up in their own world, their own little games, their own backroom deals. They spend too much time listening to the lobbyists, the special interests, the so-called ""experts"" in Washington, and not enough time listening to the forgotten men and women of this country.

They live in a bubble, a D.C. bubble, and they forget about the incredible people in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, in all these great places. They don't understand what real Americans are going through. They talk amongst themselves, they pat each other on the back, and they lose sight of the common sense that's out there, the patriotism that's out there.

That's why *we* had to come in. That's why *I* got involved. To smash that insularity, to go directly to the people, to bring their voice, *their* incredible voice, right into Washington. We're fighting against that swamp mentality every single day, draining it, frankly, because you need people who understand the country, not just the Capitol. It's about putting America First, not the Washington establishment. And we're doing it, we're doing it big."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Today's fix that you just announced leaves it up to state insurance commissioners and insurance companies to ultimately decide whether to allow old policies to be renewed for a year. How confident are you that they will do that? And secondly, how concerned are you that this flawed rollout may hurt Democrats' chances in next year's midterm elections, and your ability to advance other priorities such as immigration reform? ","On the first question, traditionally, state insurance commissioners make decisions about what plans can be or cannot be sold, how they interact with insurers. What we're essentially saying is the Affordable Care Act is not going to be the factor in what happens with folks in the individual market. And my guess is right away you're going to see a number of state insurance commissioners exercise it. Part of the challenge is the individual markets are different in different states. There are some states that have individual insurance markets that already have almost all the consumer protections that the Affordable Care Act does. They match up pretty good. It's not some big jump for folks to move into the marketplace. In others, they're pretty low standards, so you can sell pretty substandard plans in those markets. And that's where people might see a bigger jump in their premiums. So I think there's going to be some state-by-state evaluation on how this is handled. But the key point is, is that it allows us to be able to say to the folks who received these notices: Look, I, the President of the United States and the insurance –- that the insurance model, the Affordable Care Act, is not going to be getting in the way of you shopping in the individual market that you used to have. As I said, there are still going to be some folks who over time, I think, are going to find that the marketplaces are better. One way I described this to -- I met with a group of senators when this issue first came up -- and it's not a perfect analogy -- but we made a decision as a society that every car has to have a seatbelt or airbags. And so you pass a regulation. And there are some additional costs, particularly at the start of increasing the safety and protections, but we make a decision as a society that the costs are outweighed by the benefits of all the lives that are saved. So what we're saying now is if you're buying a new car, you got to have a seatbelt. Well, the problem with the grandfather clause that we put in place is it's almost like we said to folks, you got to buy a new car, even if you can't afford it right now. And sooner or later, folks are going to start trading in their old cars. But we don't need -- if their life circumstance is such where, for now at least, they want to keep the old car, even if the new car is better, we should be able to give them that option. And that's what we want to do. 3 And, by the way, that's what we should have been able to do in drafting the rules in the first place. So, again, these are two fumbles on something that -- on a big game, which -- but the game is not over. With respect to the politics of it, I'll let you guys do a lot of the work on projecting what this means for various political scenarios. There is no doubt that our failure to roll out the ACA smoothly has put a burden on Democrats, whether they're running or not, because they stood up and supported this effort through thick and thin. And I feel deeply responsible for making it harder for them rather than easier for them to continue to promote the core values that I think led them to support this thing in the first place -- which is, in this country, as wealthy as we are, everybody should be able to have the security of affordable health care. And that's why I feel so strongly about fixing it. My first and foremost obligation is the American people, to make sure that they can get what's there -- if we can just get the darn website working and smooth this thing out -- which is plans that are affordable, and allow them to take advantage of tax credits and give them a better deal. But I also do feel an obligation to everybody out there who supported this effort. When we don't do a good job on the rollout, we're letting them down. And I don't like doing that. So my commitment to them is, we're going to just keep on doing better every day until we get it done. And in terms of the impact on me -- I think to some extent I addressed it when I talked to Julie -- there are going to be ups and downs during the course of my presidency. And I think I said early on when I was running -- I am not a perfect man, and I will not be a perfect President, but I'll wake up every single day working as hard as I can on behalf of Americans out there from every walk of life who are working hard, meeting their responsibilities, but sometimes are struggling because the way the system works isn't giving them a fair shot. And that pledge I haven't broke. That commitment, that promise, continues to be -- continues to hold -- the promise that I wouldn't be perfect, number one, but also the promise that as long as I've got the honor of having this office, I'm just going to work as hard as I can to make things better for folks. And what that means specifically in this health care arena is we can't go back to the status quo. I mean, right now everybody is properly focused on us not doing a good job on the rollout, and that’s legitimate and I get it. There have been times where I thought we were kind of slapped around a little bit unjustly. This one is deserved. Right? It’s on us. But we can’t lose sight of the fact that the status quo before the Affordable Care Act was not working at all. If the health care system had been working fine, and everybody had high- quality health insurance at affordable prices, I wouldn’t have made it a priority; we wouldn’t have been fighting this hard to get it done -- which is why, when I see sometimes folks up on 4 Capitol Hill, and Republicans in particular, who have been suggesting repeal, repeal, let’s get rid of this thing, I keep on asking what is it that you want to do? Are you suggesting that the status quo was working? Because it wasn’t, and everybody knows it. It wasn’t working in the individual market and it certainly wasn’t working for the 41 million people who didn’t have health insurance. And so what we did was we chose a path that was the least disruptive, to try to finally make sure that health care is treated in this country like it is in every other advanced country -- that it’s not some privilege that just a certain portion of people can have, but it’s something that everybody has some confidence about. And we didn’t go far left and choose an approach that would have been much more disruptive. We didn’t adopt some more conservative proposals that would have been much more disruptive. We tried to choose a way that built off the existing system. But it is complicated, it is hard, but I make no apologies for us taking this on -- because somebody sooner or later had to do it. I do make apologies for not having executed better over the last several months.","Well, thank you for those questions. Good to be here.

First off, on the confidence level... Look, we've put a common-sense solution on the table. We've given states and insurance companies the flexibility they need, the flexibility they've been asking for, to do what's right by their citizens. This isn't about Washington dictating every last detail; it's about empowering local leaders and the private sector. And I am absolutely confident that when you give people the tools to fix a problem, to deliver on a promise that was made to the American people – that if you liked your plan, you could keep it – they're going to step up. They're going to use this flexibility. Because ultimately, they serve their customers, they serve their communities, and they know what's best on the ground. This plan allows them to do just that: keep good plans in place for folks who want 'em.

Now, as for your second point, about concerns over the rollout and its political implications... My concern, let me be very clear, my primary concern is always for the American people. It's about the families who've had their healthcare plans canceled through no fault of their own. It's about the folks facing higher premiums and fewer choices. That's the real issue here. When you have a government program that creates this kind of disruption, that hurts hardworking Americans, that's what keeps me up at night.

We're going to stay focused on fixing these problems, on delivering real relief, and on making sure our citizens have access to quality, affordable healthcare. As for the political consequences, well, when government tries to do too much, when it overreaches, when it makes promises it can't keep – the American people take note. And they demand accountability. My job, our job, is to solve the problem, to earn back the trust of the American people, and to ensure our country is strong and prosperous. We'll continue to work on all fronts, including important priorities like immigration reform, but we must first deliver on our commitments to the people on issues like healthcare and a growing economy. That's what's most important."
" Thanks, Mr. President. It sounds like there’s been some development in the Ukraine talks in Geneva. I’m just wondering if you could describe your level of confidence in what this agreement is and how you can be sure that Russia will follow through, given some of the remarks from President Putin this morning. ","I don’t think we can be sure of anything at this point. I think there is the possibility, the prospect that diplomacy may deescalate the situation and we may be able to move towards what has always been our goal, which is let the Ukrainians make their own decisions about their own lives. There was a meeting in Geneva -- representatives of the Ukrainian government, the Russian government, the EU, as well as the United States. It was a lengthy, vigorous conversation. My understanding is, is that the Ukrainian Prime Foreign** Minister gave a detailed and thorough presentation about the reforms that they intend to introduce, including reforms that provide assurances for Ukrainians who live in eastern and southern Ukraine that they will be fully represented, that their rights will be protected, that Russian speakers and Russian natives in Ukraine will have the full protection of the law. And my understanding, based on what I’ve heard, is that there was an acknowledgement within the meeting that the Ukrainian government in Kyiv had gone out of its way to address a range of the concerns that may have existed in southern and eastern Ukraine. There was a promising public statement that indicated the need to disarm all irregular forces and militias and groups that have been occupying buildings. There was an offer of amnesty to those who would willingly lay down their arms, evacuate those buildings, so that law and order could be restored in eastern and southern Ukraine. The Russians signed on to that statement. And the question now becomes will, in fact, they use the influence that they’ve exerted in a disruptive way to restore some order so that Ukrainians can carry out an election, move forward with the decentralization reforms that they’ve proposed, stabilize their economy, and start getting back on the path of growth and democracy and that their sovereignty will be respected. We’re not going to know whether, in fact, there’s follow-through on these statements for several days. And so today I spoke with Chancellor Merkel; later on in the day I’m going to be speaking to David Cameron. We’re going to be consulting with our European allies. Over the last week, we have put in place additional consequences that we can impose on the Russians if we do not see actual improvement of the situation on the ground. And we are coordinating now with our European allies. My hope is that we actually do see follow-through over the next several days. But I don’t think given past performance that we can count on that, and we have to be prepared to potentially respond to what continue to be efforts of interference by the Russians in Eastern and Southern Ukraine. If, in fact, we do see improvements, then that will obviously be a positive. In the meantime, we’re going to make sure that we continue to help the Ukrainian government -- working with the IMF, the Europeans and others -- to stabilize their economy and to start reforming it. We’re going to continue to work with our NATO allies to make sure that they are assured that we’re going to meet our Article 5 obligations and that they are secure. And as I’ve said before -- I think I had an interview with Major yesterday in which I mentioned this whole exercise by the Russians is not good for Russia either. There are, I think, a number of articles today indicating the degree to which an economy that was already stuck in the mud is further deteriorating because of these actions. And in my conversations with President Putin, I’ve emphasized the same thing, that we have no desire to see further deterioration of the Russian economy. On the other hand, we are going to continue to uphold the basic principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity for all countries; and that there’s a way for Ukraine to be independent, to be sovereign, and to have positive relationships with both the West and the East, with both its European neighbors and its Russian neighbors. And that’s our primary concern. Maria Peña, La Opinión.","Well, thank you for that question. We've been watching the developments in Geneva very closely, and any step toward de-escalation, toward a peaceful resolution in Ukraine, is a positive one. The agreement on paper, if fully implemented, lays out a clear path forward, addressing some critical issues.

Now, as for my confidence that Russia will follow through, especially given President Putin's remarks this morning… that's where we have to be clear-eyed. America and our allies have been around this block before. We know that trust isn't given; it's earned. And frankly, Russia's track record gives us ample reason for caution.

My confidence isn't in blind faith, but in the resolve of the free world. We will be watching Russia's actions, not just their words, very, very closely. We've made it abundantly clear, alongside our partners in Europe, that there will be significant, severe consequences for any failure to adhere to these commitments. This agreement is a chance for Russia to demonstrate it can be a responsible actor on the world stage. We certainly hope they will, but we'll judge them by their deeds, not by what they say at a podium."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I’ve got a hot spot for you here in the U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said -- or claimed that you haven’t learned how to work with them. And he’s angry that you’re attacking the GOP on the lack of movement on immigration reform. So I was wondering how you respond to that. And the second part to that, right now you have hunger strikers across the street demanding relief for undocumented immigrants. And I was wondering if you can dispel the rumors or if there’s a leak from the White House that you will make some sort of announcement in the coming weeks to expand that relief for the undocumented. Thank you. ","Well, I actually had a very pleasant conversation with Mr. Cantor yesterday.","Well, thank you for those questions. Let's tackle them one at a time.

First, regarding Majority Leader Cantor's comments, look, my administration has always been committed to working with leaders on both sides of the aisle. We have put forward serious proposals, we've had countless meetings, and my door has always been open for genuine discussion on how to fix our broken immigration system. When I speak out, it's not an attack; it's a call for action. The American people expect us to get things done, not to endlessly debate or stall. We need a secure border, and we need a system that reflects our values and our economic needs. And frankly, that means Republicans and Democrats sitting down, compromising, and delivering comprehensive immigration reform. We've shown willingness to lead, but it takes two to tango, and we need partners in Congress who are ready to join us in solving this problem for the country.

Now, on your second point, my heart goes out to anyone who feels they need to go to such lengths as a hunger strike to draw attention to an issue. Their voices are heard. We understand the urgency that many feel regarding our immigration system. As for any specific announcements or alleged leaks from the White House, let me be clear: my administration is constantly reviewing all available options, within the bounds of the law, to make our immigration system more fair, more humane, and more secure. We believe in the rule of law, and we are absolutely committed to fixing this system. However, the most durable and comprehensive solution will come through legislation passed by Congress, which is why we continue to urge them to act. We will continue to explore every avenue to improve the situation, but right now, the focus remains on getting Congress to deliver the comprehensive reform that our nation truly needs. We will always operate within the letter of the law."
 Really? ,"I did. You’re always kind of surprised by the mismatch between press releases and the conversation. I wished him happy Passover. And what I said to him privately is something that I would share with him -- that I’ve said publicly, which is there is bipartisan support for comprehensive immigration reform. It would strengthen our economy, it would help with our security, and it would provide relief to families who -- many of whom have lived here for years and who have children and family members who are U.S. citizens; and that Congress should act; and that right now what’s holding us back is House Republican leadership not willing to go ahead and let the process move forward. So it was a pretty friendly conversation. I think in his press release, I gather he was referring to the observation that we’d made a day earlier that it had now been a year since the Senate had passed a strong bipartisan bill, and that although we had heard a lot of talk about the House Republicans being interested in doing something, nothing had happened yet, and suggesting that we need some urgency here. I still feel the same way. I know there are Republicans in the House, as there are Republicans in the Senate, who know this is the right thing to do. I also know it’s hard politics for Republicans because there are some in their base that are very opposed to this. But what I also know is that there are families all across the country who are experiencing great hardship and pain because this is not getting resolved. I also know that there are businesses around the country that could be growing even faster, that our deficits could be coming down faster, that we would have more customers in our shops, if we get this thing resolved. We know what the right thing to do is. It’s a matter of political will. It’s not any longer a matter of policy. And I’m going to continue to encourage them to get this done. As far as our actions, Jeh Johnson, our new head of the Department of Homeland Security, has been talking to everybody -- law enforcement, immigrant rights groups -- to do a thorough-going review of our approach towards enforcement. And we’re doing that in consultation with Democrats and Republicans and with any interested party. I do think that the system we have right now is broken. I’m not alone in that opinion. The only way to truly fix it is through congressional action. We have already tried to take as many administrative steps as we could. We’re going to review it one more time to see if there’s more that we can do to make it more consistent with common sense and more consistent with I think the attitudes of the American people, which is we shouldn’t be in the business necessarily of tearing families apart who otherwise are law-abiding. And so let me --","Really? Well, now, that's an interesting reaction. Tell me what's on your mind, what's got you saying that. Let's talk about it."
 Do you have a time? ,I won’t get into timing right now because Mr. Johnson is going to go ahead and do that review. Tamara Keith.,"(Checks an imaginary watch, then looks up with a confident nod)

""You bet I do. Let's see here... it's about two thirty-five in the afternoon. Got a busy schedule ahead, important meetings, gotta keep the trains running on time, you know. Always keeping an eye on the clock when you're leading the greatest country on Earth."""
" So you -- regarding the Affordable Care Act, I think you -- ","Yes, let’s talk about that.","Ah, Obamacare. A disaster, folks. A total and complete disaster.

You see what's happening out there? Premiums are through the roof, deductibles are so high nobody can use their insurance. It's not working. It's failing. And we had a plan, a tremendous plan, the best plan, to repeal and replace it with something so much better, so much cheaper, and it would have protected people with pre-existing conditions, which we always will do. But we had a little trouble, you know, some of the folks, they didn't get it done. It's a shame. It's a very, very sad thing for our country. We could have had the greatest healthcare in the world, much, much better than what we have now. Much better."
" Since you brought it up. I think everyone agrees that it has flaws. But Democrats have been sort of reluctant in Congress to reopen the conversation, and Republicans have been more than happy to reopen the conversation but in a different way. Now that, as you say, it’s here to stay, there are so many people that signed up, in this environment is it possible to do the kind of corrections that the business community and many others would like to see -- sort of small, technical corrections? ","It is absolutely possible, but it will require a change in attitude on the part of the Republicans. I have always said from the outset that on any large piece of legislation like this, there are going to be things that need to be improved, need to be tweaked. I said that I think the day I signed the bill. And I don't think there’s been any hesitation on our part to consider ideas that would actually improve the legislation. The challenge we have is, is that if you have certain members in the Republican Party whose view is making it work better is a concession to me, then it's hard in that environment to actually get it done. And I recognize that their party is going through the stages of grief -- anger and denial and all that stuff -- and we're not at acceptance yet. But at some point, my assumption is, is that there will be an interest to figure out how do we make this work in the best way possible. We have 8 million people signed up through the exchanges. That doesn’t include the 3 million young people who are able to stay on their parents’ plan. It doesn’t include the 3 million people who benefited from expansions to Medicaid. So if my math is correct, that's 14 million right there. You’ve got another 5 million people who signed up outside of the marketplaces but are part of the same insurance pool. So we've got a sizable part of the U.S. population now in the first -- for the first time in many cases, in a position to enjoy the financial security of health insurance. And I'm meeting them as I'm on the road. I saw a woman yesterday -- young woman, maybe 34, with her mom and her dad, and she’s got two small kids and self-employed husband, and was diagnosed with breast cancer. And this isn’t an abstraction to her. She is saving her home. She is saving her business. She is saving her parents’ home, potentially, because she’s got health insurance, which she just could not afford. And the question now becomes if, in fact, this is working for a lot of people but there are still improvements to make, why are we still having a conversation about repealing the whole thing, and why are we having folks say that any efforts to improve it are somehow handing Obama a victory? This isn’t about me. And my hope is, is that we start moving beyond that. My suspicion is that probably will not happen until after November because it seems as if this is the primary agenda item in the Republican political platform. But here’s what I know: The American people would much rather see us talk about jobs, would much rather see us talk about high college costs, would much rather see us discussing how we can rebuild our roads and our bridges and our infrastructure and put people back to work. They’d much rather see us talk about how we’d boost wages and boost incomes and improve their individual family bottom lines. And if the Republicans want to spend the entire next six months or year talking about repealing a bill that provides millions of people health insurance without providing any meaningful alternative, instead of wanting to talk about jobs and the economic situation of families all across the country, that's their prerogative. At some point I think they’ll make the transition. That's my hope, anyway. If not, we're just going to keep on doing what we're doing, which is making it work for people all across the country. I'm sorry, I'm going to say one last thing about this, just because this does frustrate me: States that have chosen not to expand Medicaid for no other reason than political spite. You’ve got 5 million people who could be having health insurance right now at no cost to these states -- zero cost to these states -- other than ideological reasons. They have chosen not to provide health insurance for their citizens. That's wrong. It should stop. Those folks should be able to get health insurance like everybody else. Isaac, from Politico. Where are you, Isaac? There you are.","Well, you hit the nail right on the head there. Look, when you put something as big and as sweeping as that into effect, you're gonna find out pretty quickly what works and, frankly, what doesn't work so well. No piece of legislation is perfect, and nobody's claiming it is.

Now, you're absolutely right about the political dynamic. The Democrats, they've been pretty much in a defensive crouch on this, wanting to protect what they built. And we Republicans, we've always said, ""Hold on a minute, there are better ways to get Americans quality, affordable healthcare."" But you're right, it's out there, people have signed up, it's become a part of the landscape.

So, can we do those small, technical corrections? Those common-sense fixes that the business community, and a whole lot of everyday Americans, are asking for? Things that would make it run smoother, reduce some of the burdens, maybe inject a little more choice and competition into the market?

In a sane world, absolutely! That's what governing is supposed to be about. We should be able to sit down, look at the evidence, listen to the people on the ground – the patients, the doctors, the small business owners – and say, ""Alright, this isn't working as intended, let's fix it."" We're not talking about tearing the whole thing down, we're talking about making it work *better* for the American people.

The real hurdle, and you know this as well as I do, is the politics. You've got folks on the other side who seem to view any kind of change, no matter how practical or beneficial, as a challenge to their original idea. And that's a shame. Because if we truly want to serve the American people, we ought to be willing to be flexible, to learn from experience, and to make those necessary adjustments. It's about common sense, not just sticking to an ideology. We need to find a way to work together, for the good of the country."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Given all that you were just saying about the Affordable Care Act, do you think it's time for Democrats to start campaigning loudly and positively on the benefits of Obamacare? Will you lead that charge? And on Ukraine, you’ve said in other situations -- Iran, for example -- that the military option remains on the table even as talks go on. Is the military option on the table with Russia? And if so, would that be through NATO forces, through lethal aid to Ukraine? ","Now, keep in mind I think I’ve been very clear that military options are not on the table in Ukraine because this is not a situation that would be amenable to a clear military solution. What we have to do is to create an environment in which irregular forces disarm, that the seizing of buildings cease, that a national dialogue by Ukrainians -- not by Russians, not by Americans or anybody else, but by Ukrainians -- takes place. They move forward with reforms that meet the interests of the various groups within Ukraine, they move forward with elections, and they start getting their economic house in order. That’s what’s going to solve the problem. And so obviously, Russia right now still has its forces amassed along the Ukrainian-Russian border as a gesture of intimidation. And it is our belief -- and not ours alone -- but I think broad portions of the international community believe that Russia’s hand is in the disruptions and chaos that we’ve been seeing in southern and eastern Ukraine. But there is an opportunity for Russia to take a different approach. We are encouraging them to do so. In the meantime, we’re going to prepare additional responses should Russia fail to take a different course. We’ve already had an impact on their economy that is well documented. It could get significantly worse. But we don’t have an interest in hurting ordinary Russians just for the sake of it. Our strong preference would be for Mr. Putin to follow through on what is a glimmer of hope coming out of these Geneva talks. But we’re not going to count on it until we see it. And in the meantime, we’re going to prepare what our other options are. With respect to the Affordable Care Act, my point is that we’ve been having a political fight about this for five years. We need to move on to something else. That’s what the American people are interested in. I think that Democrats should forcefully defend and be proud of the fact that millions of people like the woman I just described who I saw in Pennsylvania yesterday we’re helping because of something we did. I don’t think we should apologize for it, and I don’t think we should be defensive about it. I think there is a strong, good, right story to tell. I think what the other side is doing and what the other side is offering would strip away protections from those families and from hundreds of millions of people who already had health insurance before the law passed, but never knew if the insurance company could drop them when they actually needed it, or women who were getting charged more just because they were a woman. I’m still puzzled why they’ve made this their sole agenda item when it comes to our politics. It’s curious. But what I intend to talk about is what the American people are interested in hearing: Our plans for putting people back to work; our plans for making sure our economy continues to innovate; our plans to make sure that, as I discussed yesterday, we’re training people for the jobs that are out there right now and making better use of our community colleges and linking them up with businesses; and how we’re going to continue to bring manufacturing back the way we have over the last several years; and how we’re going to put more money in the pockets of ordinary people. So if they want to -- if Republicans want to spend all their time talking about repealing a law that’s working, that’s their business. I think what Democrats should do is not be defensive, but we need to move on and focus on other things that are really important to the American people right now. 0 David Jackson.","Well, thank you, Mr. President. It's good to be here.

Look, my primary concern, and it always has been, is making sure that every American has access to quality, affordable healthcare. The Affordable Care Act, frankly, it made some important strides towards that goal – expanding coverage to millions who didn't have it before, ensuring folks with pre-existing conditions could get insurance. Now, should Democrats campaign on what they believe works for the American people? Absolutely. You always stand up for what you believe in. As for *my* leading the charge, well, my role these days is to speak to what's best for the country, to encourage dialogue, and to remind folks that making our healthcare system better, more accessible, more efficient – that's a job that needs all hands on deck, not just one side of the aisle.

Now on Ukraine, that's a profoundly serious situation, and frankly, it's different from Iran in a very fundamental way when you're talking about Russia, a major nuclear power. When we speak of a ""military option"" with Russia, we have to be clear-eyed about the immense implications for global peace and security. What's absolutely on the table, and what we *must* continue to do, is ensure Ukraine has every tool, every piece of lethal aid they need to defend their sovereignty, their territory, and their people. We must continue to strengthen NATO, to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies, and to present a united, resolute front against aggression through sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and humanitarian support. But direct military engagement by NATO forces with a nuclear-armed Russia – that’s a threshold that demands the utmost caution, and frankly, it's a conflict between nuclear powers that we must always strive to avoid. We support Ukraine's ability to defend itself, and we will continue to help them do just that, while working to ensure broader stability."
" Yes, sir. Thank you. One reason the Republicans talk about it is there are people who object to the law who said they’ve had problems with the law, and there are a significant number of opponents of the law. I guess my question is, what makes you think a significant majority of the American people, of voters, will accept this law? Or are we destined to see health care as a 50/50, red state/blue state argument for years to come? ","I think you’re mixing up two things here, David. You said there are people who have seen problems with the law. That’s not 50 percent of the American people. There may have been folks who have been affected in ways that they weren’t happy about -- by the law. That is a far smaller number than the millions of people who’ve been signed up. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be concerned about it. That’s an area where, as I said to Tamara, we should be open to other ways that we can make it even better. So that’s objective facts and real problems out there. The other side of it is just polling, right? What’s the general opinion of the law -- which is attached to general opinions about me or about Democrats and partisanship in the country generally? My view is that the longer we see the law benefiting millions of people, the more we see accusations that the law is hurting millions of people being completely debunked -- as some of you in the press have done -- and the more the average American who already has health insurance sees that it’s actually not affecting them in an adverse way, then it becomes less of a political football -- which is where I want it to be. This shouldn’t be a political football. This should be something that we take for granted, that in this country you should be able to get affordable health care regardless of how wealthy you are. Now, the larger issue about whether we can move past the polarization and sort of the bitter political debates between Democrats and Republicans, of which Obamacare is just one small part, that’s going to take more time. But it’s not for lack of trying on my part. And I think that I speak for all Democrats in saying we would much prefer a constructive conversation with the Republicans about how do we get some stuff done, and let’s focus on some areas that the American people really care about. 1 On jobs, we know that infrastructure would put people back to work right now and it would improve our economy for the long term. It didn't used to be a partisan issue. Why aren’t we coming up with a way to make sure that we’re rebuilding our roads and our bridges, and improving our air traffic control system? There’s no reason that has to be political. There really isn’t any ideological disagreement on that. And I guarantee you after this winter, if you look at the potholes that are the size of canyons all across big chunks of the United States, that people would like to see an infrastructure bill. Let’s get it done.","Well, thank you for that, son. That's a mighty good question, and it gets right to the heart of what we're trying to achieve here in this great country. You know, the American people are a smart, discerning bunch. They know when something is working for them and when it isn't.

Now, you ask what makes me think a significant majority will accept *this law*. And frankly, I don't believe they will, not as it stands. Because when folks feel like they're losing their doctor, or their plan, or their premium just keeps going up and up, and they're not getting the choices they want, well, that's not exactly a recipe for broad acceptance, is it? We've seen the evidence. People are talking, and they're telling us it's not working for them, for their families, or for their small businesses.

Are we destined to see health care as a 50/50 argument forever? I certainly hope not. I believe in the American spirit. I believe in our ability to come together and find common-sense solutions. But we've got to be honest about the problem. We need solutions that actually empower individuals, that drive down costs through real competition, and that ensure folks have quality care and real choices, not just what Washington tells 'em they can have.

That's the path to broad acceptance, my friend. Not more government mandates, but more freedom, more innovation, and more trust in the American people to make the best decisions for themselves. That's how we move past the 50/50 and get to a healthcare system that truly works for everyone."
" The next question comes from Jim Acosta of CNN. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Arigato, Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, in regards to the Senkaku Islands, I just want to make sure that this is absolutely clear. Are you saying that the U.S. would consider using military force were China to have some sort of military incursion in those islands to protect those islands? And how does that not draw another red line that you would have to enforce -- of putting U.S. credibility, your credibility on the line once again, as it was in the case with Syria and Russia? And on another key security issue, you mentioned North Korea in your meeting with the Prime Minister. Are you issuing a warning to North Korea that there should not be another nuclear test? And to Prime Minister Abe, do you have confidence in President Obama’s assurances about your security when the U.S. and the West were unable to stop Russia’s advances in Ukraine? Thank you. ","Well, Jim, let me unpack that question because there’s a whole bunch of assumptions in there, some of which I don’t agree with. First of all, the treaty between the United States and Japan preceded my birth, so obviously, this isn’t a “red line” that I’m drawing; it is the standard interpretation over multiple administrations of the terms of the alliance, which is that territories under the administration of Japan are covered under the treaty. There’s no shift in position. There’s no “red line” that’s been drawn. We’re simply applying the treaty. At the same time, as I’ve said directly to the Prime Minister that it would be a profound mistake to continue to see escalation around this issue rather than dialogue and confidence- building measures between Japan and China. And we’re going to do everything we can to encourage that diplomatically. With respect to the other issues that you raise, our position, Jim, the United States’ position is that countries should abide by international law; that those laws, those rules, those norms are violated when you gas children, or when you invade the territory of another country. Now, the implication of the question I think is, is that each and every time a country violates one of those norms the United States should go to war, or stand prepared to engage militarily, and if it doesn’t then somehow we’re not serious about those norms. Well, that’s not the case. Right now, we have 87 percent of serious chemical weapons have already been removed from Syria. There’s about 13 percent left. That’s as a consequence of U.S. leadership. And the fact that we didn’t have to fire a missile to get that accomplished is not a failure to uphold those international norms, it’s a success. It’s not a complete success until we have the last 13 percent out. With respect to Russia and Ukraine, we’ve been very clear about the fact that there’s not going to be a military solution to the problem in Ukraine, but we have already applied sanctions that have had an impact on the Russian economy and we have continued to hold out the prospect, the possibility to resolve this issue diplomatically. There was some possibility that Russia could take the wiser course after the meetings in Geneva. So far, at least, we have seen them not abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in Geneva. And instead, we continue to see militias and armed men taking over buildings, harassing folks who are disagreeing with them, and destabilizing the region, and we haven’t seen Russia step up and discourage that. On the other side, you’ve seen the government in Kyiv take very concrete steps, in introducing an amnesty law and offering a whole range of reforms with respect to the constitution, that are consistent with what was discussed in Geneva. And my expectation is, is that if, once again, Russia fails to abide by both the spirit and the letter of what was discussed in Geneva, that there will be further consequences and we will ramp up further sanctions. That doesn’t mean that the problem is going to be solved right away. These are difficult issues. But what we try to do is to make sure that we are very clear about what we stand for, what we believe in, and we are willing to take actions on behalf of those values, those norms, and those ideals. Question: And on North Korea?","""Well, thank you, Jim, for that question. And thank you, Prime Minister, for your gracious hospitality.

Let me be absolutely clear on the Senkaku Islands. The United States of America's commitment to Japan's security is, as I've said before, and will continue to say, *ironclad*. The Senkaku Islands fall under Article V of our U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. And that treaty is a sacred commitment between our two nations. Make no mistake: any unilateral action to undermine Japan's administration of those islands, any military incursion, would be met with the full force of our treaty obligations. We stand with our allies. That's what America does.

Now, regarding your suggestion about drawing another 'red line' and our credibility, Jim, that's not how we view this. This isn't about drawing *new* lines; it's about honoring *existing* treaties. This alliance, this treaty, has been the bedrock of peace and stability in this region for decades. Our credibility, frankly, rests on keeping our word, and America always keeps its word to its allies. We are a nation of principle, and we uphold our commitments.

On North Korea, my message is equally firm and unambiguous: Provocations will not be tolerated. A nuclear test would be a grave mistake, a dangerous escalation, and a direct defiance of the international community. We are working closely with Japan, South Korea, and indeed, with all responsible nations, to achieve the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang must abandon its unlawful weapons programs and return to the path of dialogue.

And as for Prime Minister Abe's confidence in our assurances, I can tell you that the Prime Minister and I have had very thorough and frank discussions. Our alliance is the cornerstone of regional peace, and there is no doubt in my mind, nor in his, about America's unwavering commitment. We stand shoulder to shoulder against these threats, and together, we will ensure the security and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific."""
" I’d like to raise a question with regard to security. First, my question is addressed to Prime Minister Abe. President Obama, with regard to the defense of the Senkaku Islands, he had clearly stated his security stance based on the security treaty. And what kind of discussion did you have on the exercise of collective security rights? To President Obama, the following question: Based on the security treaty, the obligation to defend the Senkaku Islands, this is the first time that you referred to this issue. Why did you mention this? Could you talk about the import of your statement? Prime Minister Abe: [As interpreted.] Through the talks with President Obama, as President Obama mentioned at the outset in his speech, between our two countries we have the security treaty and under the security treaty, all of the abilities and capabilities to perform the commitment is provided. And this includes all territories under the administration of Japan, inclusive of the Senkaku Islands. And any unilateral action to undermine Japan’s administration of the Senkaku Islands will be opposed by the United States. We agreed on this point. On the exercise of the right of collective defense, presently in Japan the legal basis for security is being discussed and with regard to the stability of Japan and regional safety and stability, and to function the alliance effectively, and to contribute to the stability of the region we are making these studies. This is what I have explained to President Obama. Concerning such studies and examinations being made in Japan, this was welcomed and this would be supported. That was the position expressed by President Obama. ","Our position is not new. Secretary Hagel, our Defense Secretary, when he visited here, Secretary of State John Kerry when he visited here, both indicated what has been our consistent position throughout. We don’t take a position on final sovereignty determinations with respect to Senkakus, but historically they have been administered by Japan and we do not believe that they should be subject to change unilaterally. And what is a consistent part of the alliance is that the treaty covers all territories administered by Japan. So this is not a new position, this is a consistent one. In our discussions, I emphasized with Prime Minister Abe the importance of resolving this issue peacefully -- not escalating the situation, keeping the rhetoric low, not taking provocative actions, and trying to determine how both Japan and China can work cooperatively together. And I want to make that larger point. We have strong relations with China. They are a critical country not just to the region, but to the world. Obviously, with a huge population, a growing economy, we want to continue to encourage the peaceful rise of China. I think there’s enormous opportunities for trade, development, working on common issues like climate change with China. But what we’ve also emphasized - - and I will continue to emphasize throughout this trip -- is that all of us have responsibilities to help maintain basic rules of the road and an international order so that large countries, small countries, all have to abide by what is considered just and fair, and that we are resolving disputes in peaceful fashion. And this is a message that I’ve delivered directly to the Chinese and it’s one that I think is entirely consistent with China being successful. I think the alternative is a situation in which large countries, like the United States or China or Russia or other countries, feel as if whenever they think it’s expedient they can take actions that disadvantage smaller countries, and that’s not the kind of world that is going to be stable and prosperous and secure over the long term. So we are invested in an international order, and that applies to a whole range of issues, including maritime issues. My hope is, is that China will continue to engage with us and other countries in the region where we do not take a position on the particular sovereignty of this piece of land or this rock but we do take a position in making sure that all countries are following basic international procedures in resolving these disputes. And if that happens, then I think not only will China be successful, but I think there’s a great potential for Chinese and Japanese cooperation, Chinese and Vietnamese cooperation, cooperation with the Philippines and China -- all of which will benefit the peoples of the region. Mr. Carney: The next question comes from Jim Acosta of CNN.","Well, listen, when it comes to our alliances, particularly with a vital friend like Japan, America's word is gold. You heard President Obama, and you heard Prime Minister Abe – the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, it's a bedrock. It's not just some old document; it's a living commitment to defend Japan, and that includes all territories under its administration, the Senkakus. That's been the understanding, plain and simple, for a long, long time.

Now, why state it clearly? Sometimes, in this world, you just gotta be unambiguous. You gotta make sure that no one, anywhere, misunderstands our resolve to stand with our allies. It sends a message, a clear signal, that we're not gonna tolerate unilateral actions that try to change the status quo by force or intimidation. That's not how free nations operate, and America will always stand against it.

And Prime Minister Abe's discussions about strengthening Japan's own collective self-defense? That's good. That's a sign of a strong, responsible ally. When our friends are stronger, the alliance is stronger, and that makes the whole region more stable, more secure. We believe in peace through strength, and when our allies are strong with us, that strength is multiplied. It's about mutual respect, mutual defense, and ensuring that freedom and stability prevail. That's what America has always stood for, and that's what we'll continue to stand for."

But what we try to do is to make sure that we are very clear about what we stand for, what we believe in, and we are willing to take actions on behalf of those values, those norms, and those ideals.","Alright, let me be very clear about this, because it's important.

First, on the Senkaku Islands. Let me tell you straight: The United States' commitment to Japan's security under Article 5 of our mutual security treaty is *ironclad*. That includes the Senkaku Islands. They fall under the administration of Japan, and our treaty obligations are unequivocal. We stand by our allies. That's what America does.

Now, you talk about ""red lines"" and comparing it to other situations. Look, we're not talking about arbitrary lines here. We're talking about a solemn treaty, a cornerstone of peace and stability in the Pacific for decades. When America makes a commitment to an ally, our word is our bond. There's no doubt, no ambiguity. We uphold our obligations. That's simply different from other challenges the world faces, where the circumstances and our relationships are different. Our alliances are fundamental.

Second, on North Korea. Let me be very direct: Any further nuclear tests, any provocative actions by North Korea, would be a serious mistake. It would be a grave threat to regional stability and to the peace of the world. It is simply unacceptable, and the international community would hold them accountable. They need to choose a different path, a path of peace and cooperation, not provocation and isolation.

And to Prime Minister Abe, let me just reinforce what I've said. When the United States gives its word, we stand by it. Our commitment to Japan is unwavering. It has been for a long, long time. We face challenges in different parts of the world, yes, but our alliance with Japan is one of the strongest pillars of our foreign policy, and our commitment to your security, Mr. Prime Minister, is absolute. You can count on America. Thank you."
 And on North Korea? ,And the question was?,"Well, listen, folks, North Korea, it's always been a persistent challenge, hasn't it? A very serious situation. When I was in office, we were quite clear: the proliferation of nuclear weapons, that's simply unacceptable. It poses a grave threat to regional stability, and frankly, it jeopardizes the security of our vital allies like South Korea and Japan.

Our approach was always one of steady resolve. We believed in working closely with our international partners, building strong coalitions, and upholding the integrity of the non-proliferation regime. You've got to have robust diplomacy, absolutely, but that has to be backed up by a strong, credible defense. We have to ensure our allies know, unequivocally, that we stand with them.

It's about maintaining that difficult balance: firmness when necessary, but always keeping the door open to dialogue, trying to find a peaceful resolution without compromising our core principles or the security of our interests. That's the prudent course, and it requires a steady hand."
 Is there a warning to North Korea to not conduct another nuclear test? ,"North Korea has engaged in provocative actions for the last several decades. It’s been an irresponsible actor on the international stage for the last several decades. So our message on North Korea has been consistent throughout. They are the most isolated country in the world. They are subject to more international sanctions and international condemnation than any country in the world. As a consequence, their people suffer as much as any peoples in the world. And what we’ve said is if you are, in fact, serious about North Korea being a normal nation, then you’ve got to start changing your behavior. And that starts with the basic principle of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Now, am I optimistic that there’s going to be a major strategic shift in North Korea’s attitudes any time soon? Probably not. But what I am confident about is, is that working with Japan, working with the Republic of Korea, and working with China and other interested parties in the region, that we can continue to apply more and more pressure on North Korea so that at some juncture they end up taking a different course. In the meantime, they’re dangerous, and we have to make sure that we are guarding against any provocations getting out of hand. This is one of the reasons why the alliance is so important and collective self-defense is so important. But we are not surprised when they engage in irresponsible behavior. That’s been their pattern for the last couple of decades. And what we have to do is to continue to try to contain and mitigate the potential damage that this behavior has and continue to put pressure on them so that we can see a shift. And China’s participation in pushing the DPRK in a different direction is critically important as well. They have not only an opportunity but I think a security interest and a broader interest in a peaceful resolution to what has been a generation-long conflict and is the most destabilizing, dangerous situation in all of the Asia Pacific region. Prime Minister Abe: [As interpreted.] First of all, I would like to state the following: The Japan-U.S. alliance is unwavering and it’s indispensable to maintain the Asia Pacific region peaceful and stable. The Japan-U.S. alliance and the relationship and the strengthening thereof is very beneficial. And to strengthen our bilateral relationship, you have tremendous enthusiasm. I believe in that. And your enthusiasm and the United States’ is what we place our confidence in. And in the talks between us today that confidence became even stronger. This is something that I wished to mention to you. And the alliance between our two countries in order to strengthen this -- or if we strengthen this, this is not applying pressure to other countries or intimidating other countries. This is for the peace and stability of the region and to strengthen this and to make this region a law- abiding region. Changes of the status quo based on intimidation and coercion will not be condoned. We want to make this a peaceful region which values laws, and in doing this strengthening of our bilateral alliance is extremely important. On this point, I fully trust President Obama. The reporter has mentioned the situation in Ukraine. In The Hague the G7 meeting took place, and President Obama exerted strong leadership and the G7 was united in its approach toward Russia. Annexation of Crimea in violation of the international laws would not be condoned -- that was the message which was generated to Russia. We would continue to communicate information -- message under the leadership of President Obama to Russia. And with regard to the DPRK, unless they change the present policies there is no future for the public in the DPRK. We need to make the DPRK understand this and pressure must be applied with cooperation between the international society to achieve this. And China holds the key to this. Japan, the United States, and ROK must exercise its influence over China. With regard to the Asia Pacific region as well as international society, there are various challenges and the alliance must continue to be robust so that we can cooperate to resolve issues in Asia and in the world.","Well, let me tell ya, when it comes to North Korea and their nuclear ambitions, the warnings from the United States and our allies are constant, they're consistent, and they're as clear as a bell. You can bet your bottom dollar that any talk of another nuclear test is met with immediate and unequivocal condemnation from Washington, from Seoul, from Tokyo, and from the broader international community, including the United Nations.

We've made it absolutely plain, time and again, that such a provocative act would be a grave violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions. It would only deepen Pyongyang's isolation, lead to even more crippling sanctions, and further destabilize the Korean Peninsula and indeed the entire region.

Our message has been, and always will be, unwavering: North Korea must abandon its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs completely, verifiably, and irreversibly. We maintain a strong defensive posture with our allies and continue to pursue a diplomatic path, but let there be no doubt, we will protect American interests and the security of our friends in the region. They need to understand that the path to a brighter future for their people is through denuclearization, not through provocations."
" On the TPP, I’d like to ask the question to the two leaders. First to Prime Minister Abe, regarding TPP -- negotiations and consultations are to continue, you have said. What are the remaining issues? And to what extent have you made progress at the Diet? With regard to the five sensitive items they resolve that in this stage the elimination of tariffs would not be accepted. Do you believe under such circumstances an agreement can be reached? The next question to President Obama. Japan, with regard to rice and wheat and beef and pork, is very careful about reducing tariffs. What is your view on this for agreement between Japan and the United States? Agriculture, produce tariffs -- what is the ideal resolution to this issue in your view, please? Prime Minister Abe: [As interpreted.] On the TPP, this is to create a major economic zone in the growth area of Asia -- basic human rights, rule of law, and democracy with countries that share these values. We will be creating new rules and it is for this purpose. It is the 21st-century type of economic zone which we wish to create. For the region as a whole, it’s strategically very important, and we see eye-to-eye on this point between President Obama and myself. The remaining issues must be overcome very quickly and resolved so that TPP as a whole can be concluded. We should cooperate and exert further leadership. And that is the task that President Obama and I have, I believe. And from a broad perspective, along with President Obama, we want to make decisions and judgments. On the part of our country, there is this resolution adopted by the Diet. We will take the proper heed of this so that we will choose the path in the best interest of the country. But we also hope to conclude the talks in a favorable way. We want to try to achieve conclusion of the talks as a whole. ","I will leave the details of the negotiations to the negotiators. I think it’s fair to say that there are certain sectors of the Japanese economy -- agricultural sectors, the auto sector -- in which market access has been restricted historically, certainly compared to the market access that Japan has had to U.S. consumers. And those are all issues that people are all familiar with, and at some point have to be resolved. I believe that point is now. Prime Minister Abe, I think courageously, has recognized that although Japan continues to be one of the most powerful economies in the world, that over the last two decades its pace of growth and innovation had stalled and that if, in fact, Japan wanted to push forward in this new century then reforms were going to have to take place. And he has initiated a number of those reforms. TPP is consistent with those reforms. And as Prime Minister Abe said, there’s strategic importance to this because what’s happening now is we’re shaping the economic environment for the fastest-growing region in the world, not just for this year or next year, but potentially for this decade and the next decade. 0 And what rules apply -- whether we are operating in a fair and transparent way, whether intellectual property is respected, whether markets are freely accessible, whether, in fact, countries are able to increase trade and as a consequence, increase jobs and prosperity for their people -- a lot of that is going to depend on choices and decisions that we make right now. TPP is an opportunity for us to make that happen. Now, there are always political sensitivities in any kind of trade discussions. Prime Minister Abe has got to deal with his politics; I’ve got to deal with mine. And I think that Congress has passed, for example, recently a free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea and other countries around the world, and it’s been based on notions of reciprocity and notions that if we tear down some of these existing barriers that both countries can do better, both countries can grow. This is even more challenging because we have more countries involved. But my basis for doing this is because, ultimately, I think it’s good for America to have a Asia Pacific region where our companies can innovate, can compete, can sell our goods and services freely, where our intellectual property is protected. And I think that’s going to create more jobs in the United States. It’s going to create greater prosperity in the United States. But it’s a win-win situation, because I think the same is going to be true for Japan, the same is going to be true for Malaysia, the same is going to be true for Vietnam, the same is going to be true for the other countries that are in this discussion. But that means that short term, all of us have to move out of our comfort zones and not just expect that we’re going to get access to somebody else’s market without providing access to our own. And it means that we have to sometimes push our constituencies beyond their current comfort levels because ultimately it’s going to deliver a greater good for all people. Mr. Carney: Julie Pace of the Associated Press has the final question.","Alright, thank you. That's a good question, an important question. Look, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this isn't just about trade, it's about building a strong alliance, strengthening the ties with our friends across the Pacific. It's about the future, for America and for our partners.

Now, when it comes to agriculture – rice, wheat, beef, pork – let me be clear: American farmers, they are the best in the world. They produce the highest quality, most competitive products you can find anywhere. And they deserve a fair shot, a level playing field, to sell those incredible goods to markets around the globe.

We understand that every nation has its sensitive areas, its traditions, its farmers who are important to their way of life. We respect that. But the ideal resolution here, for both our countries and for the entire region, is to open up those markets. Get rid of those old tariffs that just stand in the way of progress.

When you lower those barriers, it's not just good for American farmers getting new customers, it's good for Japanese consumers too. They get more choice, competitive prices, and they get to enjoy the finest agricultural products in the world. It's a win-win situation, a real common-sense approach.

We're going to keep working with our friends in Japan. We're having tough but honest conversations, and we're confident we can find a way to address these concerns while still achieving the ambitious goal of a truly free and open market. Because that's what's going to drive prosperity and security for all of us in the 21st century. We're going to get this done."
" I wanted to go back to the situation in Ukraine. You said that Russia is so far not abiding by the Geneva agreement, but you appeared to indicate that you have not made a decision yet on levying further sanctions. So, first, can you just clarify whether you have or have not made that decision? And if you have not, what gives you confidence that holding off on further sanctions might change Russia’s calculus? And couldn’t they just be using the Geneva agreement as a stalling tactic as they weigh military options or try to influence the May Ukraine elections? And, Prime Minister Abe, there are historical disputes in Asia that are a powerful source of tension and instability in this region. What responsibility do you and other leaders in Asia have to avoid inflammatory language or actions, including further visits to the Yasukuni Shrine that could further exacerbate these tensions? Thank you. 1 ","Well, Julie, we have been consistently preparing for the possibility that, in fact, Geneva didn’t deliver on its promise. I think you’ll remember I was asked the day that the discussions had concluded what my hopes were and I said, well, I’m not overly optimistic about the ability to deliver. And so what that means is that we have been preparing for the prospect that we’re going to have to engage in further sanctions. Those are teed up. It requires some technical work and it also requires coordination with other countries. So the fact that I haven’t announced them yet doesn’t mean that they haven’t been prepared and teed up. At the point where they are ready to go, I guarantee you AP is going to be the first to know.","Well, thank you for that question, son. Let me be very clear about the situation with Russia and these Geneva agreements. We are watching Russia's actions very, very closely. And to your first point, no, we have not made a final decision on levying *further* sanctions at this exact moment. All options remain on the table, as they always do when our national interests and the principles of international law are at stake.

Now, you ask what gives us confidence that holding off might change Russia's calculus? Look, diplomacy is not just about making demands; it's about giving an agreement a real chance to succeed. The Geneva agreement, if truly abided by, offers a path forward, a way to de-escalate this crisis. We believe in giving good faith efforts a chance to work. But let me be absolutely crystal clear: our confidence is not in Russia's goodwill alone. Our confidence is in our ability to hold them accountable. We are evaluating their adherence to these commitments hour by hour, day by day.

And as for your point about stalling tactics – that's a very fair question, and frankly, it's a concern we share. We are not naive here, folks. We understand the historical context, and we are fully aware of the potential for cynical maneuverings. That's precisely why we are not taking our eye off the ball. We are not just hoping for the best; we are *preparing* for the worst. If Russia uses this agreement as a pretext for further aggression, or to influence the upcoming Ukrainian elections, then the consequences will be severe, and they will be swift. We have a range of tools at our disposal, and we are absolutely prepared to use them if Russia fails to meet its obligations. We expect Russia to live up to its commitments, and if they don't, then we will act. Make no mistake about that."
 I’ll hold you to that. ,"But I think it’s important to emphasize that throughout this process, our goal has been to change Mr. Putin’s calculus; that our preference is to resolve this issue diplomatically; that sanctions hurt Russia more than anybody else but they’re disruptive to the global economy and they’re unnecessary if, in fact, Russia would recognize that the government in Kyiv is prepared to have serious negotiations that preserve the rights of all Ukrainians, including Russian speakers, and is prepared to decentralize in ways that, originally, Mr. Putin said were of utmost importance to him. So far, at least, they have not chosen the wise path. And over the medium and long term, this is going to hurt Russia as much as it hurts Ukraine. Already you’ve seen a whole lot of money, a whole lot of foreign investors leaving Russia because they don’t see this as a reliable place to invest. And Russia needs to reform its economy and needs to diversify its economy because the rest of the world is moving further and further off the fossil fuels that are the primary way that Russia is able to bankroll itself. And the decisions right now that are being made in Ukraine will not help that process; it will hinder it. Now, I understand that additional sanctions may not change Mr. Putin’s calculus -- that’s possible. How well they change his calculus in part depends on not just us applying sanctions but also the cooperation of other countries. And that’s why there’s got to be a lot of diplomatic spadework done at each phase of this process. And in discussions that I’ve had with Prime Minister Abe, in discussions that I had with my European counterparts, my consistent point has been there’s some things the United States can do alone, but ultimately it’s going to have to be a joint effort, a collective effort. And so while we’ve done our homework and we have things teed up, it’s also important for us to make sure that we’re in consultation with all these countries each and every time that we apply additional sanctions.","You bet you will. A promise made is a promise kept, and I stand by my word. That's just the way it is."
 Can I clarify? ,Sure. 2,"Certainly. Please, go right ahead. I'm happy to address any questions you might have. What's on your mind?"
" Hi, Mr. President. I’m from Cambodia, and I went to Institute of Foreign Languages at the Royal University of Phnom Penh. And I’ve got a very simple question for you. What was your dream when you were in your 20s, and did you achieve it? And if so, how did you achieve it? ","Well, it’s a short question but it’s not a simple one. When I was in high school -- so, for those of you who are studying under a different system, when I was 15, 16, 17, before I went to the university -- I wasn’t always the best student. Sometimes I was enjoying life too much. Don’t clap. This guy is the same way. No, part of it I was rebelling, which is natural for young people that age. I didn’t know my father, and so my family life was complicated. So I didn’t always focus on my studies, and that probably carried over into the first two years of university. But around the age of 20, I began to realize that I could have an impact on the world if I applied myself more. I became interested in social policy and government, and I decided that I wanted to work in the non-profit sector for people who are disadvantaged in the United States. And so I was able to do that for three years after I graduated from college. That’s how I moved to the city of Chicago. I was hired by a group of churches to work in poor areas to help people get jobs and help improve housing and give young people more opportunity. And that was a great experience for me, and it led me to go to law school and to practice civil rights laws, and then ultimately to run for elected office. And when I think back to my journey, my past, I think the most important thing for -- and maybe the most important thing for all the young people here -- is to realize that you really can have an impact on the world; you can achieve your dreams. But in order to do so, you have to focus not so much on a title or how much money you’re going to make, you have to focus more on what kind of influence and impact are you going to have on other people’s lives -- what good can you do in the world. Now, that may involve starting a business, but if you want to start a business you should be really excited about the product or the service that you’re making. It shouldn’t just be how much money I can make -- because the business people who I meet who do amazing things, like Bill Gates, who started Microsoft -- they’re usually people who are really interested in what they do and they really think that it can make a difference in people’s lives. If you want to go into government, you shouldn’t just want to be a particular government official. You should want to go into government because you think it can help educate some children, or it can help provide jobs for people who need work. So I think the most important thing for me was when I started thinking more about other people and how I could have an impact in my larger society and community, and wasn’t just thinking about myself. 0 That’s when I think your dreams can really take off -- because if you’re only thinking about you, then your world is small; if you‘re thinking about others, then your world gets bigger. Thank you. Moderator Woo: Thank you, Mr. President. We now have a question from the social media, which we’ve been collecting over the week.","Well, thank you for that question, my friend from Cambodia. That's a great question, truly. And a pleasure to meet someone from the Institute of Foreign Languages – very important work you're doing there, understanding the world.

You know, when I was in my 20s, back in the late 60s and early 70s, I was at Georgetown, then Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and then Yale Law School. And my dream, it wasn't about getting rich, no. My dream was always about public service. It was about making a difference, about using whatever talents I had to help people, to build a better future for my community, for my state, and ultimately, for my country. I truly believed in the power of government, when it was working right, to improve lives and expand opportunity. I wanted to be part of that. I wanted to contribute.

Did I achieve it? Oh, absolutely. More than I ever could have imagined, frankly. I started out as Attorney General of Arkansas, then Governor, and then, by the grace of God and the incredible support of the American people, I got to serve as President of the United States. And that was the culmination of that dream, that desire to serve.

How did I achieve it? Well, I think it came down to a few things. First, hard work, plain and simple. You've got to put in the hours, you've got to study, you've got to listen. Second, and this is crucial, it was about connecting with people. Really listening to their concerns, understanding their hopes and their struggles, and then working tirelessly to address them. You can't lead people if you don't know them, if you don't care about them. And finally, it was about persistence. There were plenty of setbacks along the way, plenty of times when things didn't go my way. But you've got to pick yourself up, learn from your mistakes, and keep moving forward, always keeping that core dream of service in your heart.

So yes, I can look back and say that young man's dream, it certainly came true, and it was an incredible journey."
" The question comes from our friend from Burma, from Myanmar. And he asks: To Mr. President, what would be your own key words or encouragement for each of us leaders of our next generation while we are cooperating with numerous diversities such as different races, languages, beliefs and cultures not only in Myanmar, but also across ASEAN? Thank you. ","Well, it’s a great question. If you look at the biggest source of conflict and war and hardship around the world, one of the most if not the most important reasons is people treating those who are not like them differently. So in Myanmar right now, they’re going through a transition after decades of repressive government, they’re trying to open things up and make the country more democratic. And that’s a very courageous process that they’re going through. But the danger, now that they’re democratizing is that there are different ethnic groups and different religions inside of Myanmar, and if people start organizing politically around their religious identity or around their ethnic identity as opposed to organizing around principles of justice and rule of law and democracy, then you can actually start seeing conflicts inside those countries that could move Myanmar in a very bad direction -- particularly, if you’ve got a Muslim minority inside of Myanmar right now that the broader population has historically looked down upon and whose rights are not fully being protected. Now, that’s not unique to Myanmar. Here in Malaysia, this is a majority Muslim country. But then, there are times where those who are non-Muslims find themselves perhaps being disadvantaged or experiencing hostility. In the United States, obviously historically the biggest conflicts arose around race. And we had to fight a civil war and we had to have a civil rights movement over the course of generations until I could stand before you as a President of African descent. But of course, the job is not done. There is still discrimination and prejudice and ethnic conflict inside the United States that we have to be vigilant against. 1 So my point is all of us have within us biases and prejudices of people who are not like us or were not raised in the same faith or come from a different ethnic background. But the world is shrinking. It’s getting smaller. You could think that way when we were all living separately in villages and tribes, and we didn’t have contact with each other. We now have the Internet and smart phones, and our cultures are all colliding. The world has gotten smaller and no country is going to succeed if part of its population is put on the sidelines because they’re discriminated against. Malaysia won’t succeed if non-Muslims don’t have opportunity. Myanmar won’t succeed if the Muslim population is oppressed. No society is going to succeed if half your population -- meaning women -- aren’t getting the same education and employment opportunities as men. So I think the key point for all of you, especially as young people, is you should embrace your culture. You should be proud of who you are and your background. And you should appreciate the differences in language and food. And how you worship God is going to be different, and those are things that you should be proud of. But it shouldn’t be a tool to look down on somebody else. It shouldn’t be a reason to discriminate. And you have to make sure that you are speaking out against that in your daily life, and as you emerge as leaders you should be on the side of politics that brings people together rather than drives them apart. That is the most important thing for this generation. And part of the way to do that is to be able to stand in other people’s shoes, see through their eyes. Almost every religion has within it the basic principle that I, as a Christian, understand from the teachings of Jesus. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Treat people the way you want to be treated. And if you’re not doing that and if society is not respecting that basic principle, then we’re going backwards instead of going forward. And this is true all around the world. And sometimes, it’s among groups that those of us on the outside, we look -- they look exactly the same. In Northern Ireland, there has been a raging conflict -- although they have finally come to arrive at peace -- because half or a portion of the population is Catholic, a portion is Protestant. From the outside, you look -- why are they arguing? They’re both Irish. They speak the same language. It seems as if they’d have nothing to argue about. But that’s been a part of Ireland that has been held back and is poor and less developed than the part of Ireland that didn’t have that conflict. In Africa, you go to countries -- my father’s country of Kenya, where oftentimes you’ve seen tribal conflicts from the outside you’d think, what are they arguing about? This is a country that has huge potential. They should be growing, but instead they spend all their time arguing and organizing politically only around tribe and around ethnicity. 2 And then, when one gets on top, they’re suspicious and they’re worried that the other might take advantage of them. And when power shifts, then it’s payback. And we see that in society after society. The most important thing young people can do is break out of that mindset. When I was in Korea, I had a chance to -- or in Tokyo rather -- I had a chance to see an exhibit with an astronaut, a Japanese astronaut who was at the International Space Station and it was looking at the entire globe and they’re tracking now changing weather patterns in part because it gives us the ability to respond to disasters quicker. And when you see astronauts from Japan or from the United States or from Russia or others working together, and they’re looking down at this planet from a distance you realize we’re all on this little rock in the middle of space and the differences that seem so important to us from a distance dissolve into nothing. And so, we have to have that same perspective -- respecting everybody, treating everybody equally under the law. That has to be a principle that all of you uphold. Great question. Let me call on the -- I’m going to go boy, girl, boy, girl so that everybody gets a fair chance. Let’s see, hold on. This gentleman right here, right there with the glasses. There you go.","Well, thank you, my friend, for that important question from Myanmar, from Burma. And it's a question that resonates, not just in your part of the world, but truly across the globe, especially in these times.

My key words, my encouragement for you, the next generation of leaders across ASEAN and within Myanmar, as you navigate this beautiful but complex tapestry of races, languages, beliefs, and cultures? It's really about **unity, respect, and a commitment to shared progress.**

First, **unity**. Not uniformity, mind you. You don't lose your identity, your heritage, your unique traditions. But you find common cause. You recognize that while you may speak different tongues or worship in different ways, you all share fundamental human aspirations: peace for your families, opportunity for your children, and a secure future for your nation. It's about looking beyond what might appear to divide you and focusing on what can bring you together for the common good.

Second, **respect**. Genuine respect for every individual, for every tradition, for every belief. It means listening, truly listening, even to those with whom you disagree. It means understanding that diversity isn't a weakness to be overcome, but a strength, a source of richness, innovation, and new ideas. You learn more from someone different from you than from someone who thinks exactly the same way. Embrace that richness.

And finally, **a commitment to shared progress**. Leadership isn't just about maintaining the status quo, especially when you face these challenges. It's about moving forward, together. It's about building institutions that serve all your people, ensuring justice, and creating economies where everyone has a fair shot. It’s about securing the peace and prosperity of your region, not just for one group, but for all.

This isn't easy work. It demands courage. It demands patience. But it is the most important work you will ever do. You, the next generation, carry the hopes of your people. Embrace the challenge, lead with your heart and your head, and remember that a strong, united future is always built on understanding and cooperation. God bless you, and God bless your important work."
" Hello, Mr. President. ",Hello.,"Well, hello there! It's a real pleasure to hear from you. Always good to connect with folks.

What's on your mind today?"
" I’m from Malaysia, currently with YES Alumni Malaysia. Well, I have a question. I wondered what was your first project -- community service project that you didn’t like and how did the project impact your community? Thank you so much. ","That’s a great question. I told you that when I graduated from college, I wanted to work in poor neighborhoods. And so, I moved to Chicago and I worked. This community had gone through some very difficult times. The steel plants there, the steel mills had closed. A lot of manufacturing was moving out of America or becoming technologically obsolete, these old mills. And so, these were areas that had been entirely dependent on steel. And as those jobs left, the communities were being abandoned. And there was also racial change in the area. They had been predominantly white, and then blacks and Latinos had moved in. And there was fear among the various groups. So they had a lot of problems. I will tell you this, what I did was I organized a series of meetings listening to people to find out what they wanted to do something about first. 3 The most immediate problem they saw was there was a lot of crime that had emerged in the area, but they didn’t quite know how to do anything about it. So I organized a meeting with the police commander, so that they could file their complaints directly to the police commander and try to get more action to create more safe space in those communities for children and to end people standing on street corners, because it was depressing the whole community. Now, here’s the main thing I want to tell you. That first meeting, nobody came. It was a complete failure and I was very depressed, because I thought, well, everybody said that they were concerned about crime, but when I organized the meeting nobody came. And what it made me realize is, is that if you want to bring about change in a community or in a nation it’s not going to happen overnight. Usually, it’s very hard to bring about change, because people are busy in their daily lives. They have things to do. One of the things I realized was I hadn’t organized the meeting at the right time. It was right around dinner time, and if people were working they were coming home and picking up their kids, and they couldn’t get to the meeting fast enough. So, first of all, you’ve got to try to get people involved. And a lot of people are busy in their own lives or they don’t think it’s going to make a difference or they’re scared if they’re speaking out against authority. And many of the problems that we’re facing, like trying to create jobs or better opportunity or dealing with poverty or dealing with the environment, these are problems that have been going on for decades. And so, to think that somehow you’re going to change it in a day or a week, and then if it doesn’t happen you just give up, well, then you definitely won’t succeed. So the most important thing that I learned as a young person trying to bring about change is you have to be persistent, and you have to get more people involved, and you have to form relationships with different groups and different organizations. And you have to listen to people about what they’re feeling and what they’re concerned about, and build trust. And then, you have to try to find a small part of the problem and get success on that first, so that maybe from there you can start something else and make it bigger and make it bigger, until over time you are really making a difference in your community and in that problem. But you can’t be impatient. And the great thing about young people is they’re impatient. The biggest problem with young people is they’re impatient. It’s a strength, because it’s what makes you want to change things. But sometimes, you can be disappointed if change doesn’t happen right away and then you just give up. And you just have to stay with it and learn from your failures, as well as your successes. 4 Anita. Moderator Woo: Mr. President, thank you very much. We have a question from our friend in Singapore. He asks, what is the legacy you wish to leave behind?","Well now, that's a darn good question, and a real pleasure to hear from our friends over in Malaysia, especially the YES Alumni. You folks are doing important work building bridges, and I commend you for it.

My first community service project that I didn't much care for... *chuckles softly* ...that takes me back a ways. I was just a young fella, probably in high school, and it was a blistering hot summer day in our little town. The project was to clean out a stretch of the local creek – a real mess of overgrown brush, old tires, and just general garbage that had accumulated over the years.

To be honest with you, I wasn't thrilled. It was dirty, smelly work. We were wading in mucky water, swatting at flies, pulling out rusty old cans and splintered wood. It wasn't glorious, didn't feel particularly heroic, and certainly wasn't what I'd rather be doing on a sunny Saturday afternoon. I probably grumbled a fair bit under my breath, thinking, ""Couldn't someone else do this?"" or ""Is this really making a difference?""

But you know what? As the day wore on, and more and more of that trash got hauled out, you could actually see the water start to look clearer. The banks, once impassable, began to open up. And by the end of the day, when we were all exhausted and covered in mud, that stretch of creek looked... well, it looked like a creek again, not a dumping ground.

The impact was immediate and long-lasting for our community. Folks started noticing. Kids could actually play near that part of the creek without worrying about stepping on something sharp. Ducks and fish slowly came back. It wasn't just cleaner; it became a usable, natural space again. It encouraged others to keep it clean, too.

What I learned that day, even though I didn't like the *process* much at the time, was a valuable lesson in duty and the power of rolling up your sleeves. Sometimes, the most important work, the work that truly benefits your community, isn't glamorous. It's the gritty, thankless stuff. But those are often the projects that truly make a tangible difference, piece by piece, building up to something great. It taught me that even the smallest, dirtiest effort, when combined with others, can lead to real, positive change for everyone.

Keep up the great work, YES Alumni. You're building leaders, and that's essential for a better world."
" Good afternoon, Mr. President, and welcome to Malaysia. Gathering from what you’ve said, I think it's a shared consensus that youth worldwide can be the catalyst, planting the seeds for an early conditioning on certain global issues here. So my question is how exactly can America lead us youth internationally in championing such issues, for example, climate change, women empowerment, poverty eradication -- the goal being to bring the human race together? It appears that a lot of policies have been put in place, but a lot of the policies that have been put in place by the Gen Xers, the Baby Boomers. People like us, the Gen Ys, we don't have a say in this policy, so we are supposed to champion them, but how are we supposed to do all these things? ","I'm trying to figure out which generation I am. You got Baby Boomers, then Gen X, and then there’s a Gen Y -- we're on Y? Is that Z, are they here yet, or -- that's next? Well, first of all, just to be very specific, as I said in my speech, part of the reason that I like to meet with young people is to get their suggestions and their ideas. But then what we try to do is set up a process and a network of young leaders who can share ideas with each other and with us, to let us know how they think we can empower you. 7 So coming out of this meeting, there will be mechanisms through social media and in our embassies in each of the 10 ASEAN countries where we're going to be bringing together youth leaders to talk to each other about their plans, what their priorities are, how they think the United States can be most helpful. And we're going to take your suggestions. And let’s take the example of something like climate change. The voice of young people on this issue is so important because you are the ones who are going to have to deal with the consequences of this most significantly. I rode with Prime Minister Najib from our press conference to the new MaGIC Center that's been set up -- entrepreneurial center that came out of our global entrepreneur summit that was hosted here in Malaysia. And on the ride over, it hadn’t started raining yet, but you could tell it was going to be raining soon. And he said that here in Malaysia you’ve already seen a change in weather patterns -- it used to be that the dry season and the rainy season was very clear. Now it all just kind of is blurring together. Now, not all of that can be directly attributed precisely to climate change. But when you look at what’s been happening all across the country or all around the world, there’s no doubt that weather patterns are changing. It is getting warmer. That is going to have impacts in terms of more flooding, more drought, displacement. It could affect food supplies. It could affect the incidences of diseases. Coastal communities could be severely affected. And what happens when humans are placed under stress is the likelihood of conflict increases. There is a theory that one of the things that happened in Syria to trigger the protests that resulted in the terrible, violent efforts to suppress them by President Assad was repeated drought in Syria that drove people off their land, so they could no longer afford to make the traditional living that they had made. Now, whether that’s true or not we don’t know precisely. But what we do know is that you see in communities that are under severe weather pressure -- drought, famine, food prices increasing -- they’re more likely to be in conflict. And you’re going to have to deal with this, unless we do something about it. So the question is what can we do? Every country should be coming up with a Climate Action Plan to try to reduce its carbon emissions. In Southeast Asia, one of the most important issues is deforestation. In Indonesia and Malaysia, what you’ve seen is huge portions of tropical forests that actually use carbon and so reduce the effects of climate change, reduce carbon being released into the atmosphere and warming the planet -- they’re just being shredded because of primarily the palm oil industry. And there are large business interests behind that industry. 8 Now, the question is are we going to in each of those countries say how can we help preserve these forests while using a different approach to economic development that does less to damage the atmosphere? And that means engaging then with the various stakeholders. You’ve got to talk to the businesses involved. You’ve got to talk to the government, the communities who may be getting jobs -- because their first priority is feeding themselves, so if you just say, we’ve got to stop cutting down the forests, but you don’t have an alternative opportunity for people then they may just ignore you. So there are going to be all kinds of pieces just to that one part of the problem. And each country may have a different element to it. The point, though, is that you have to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. You have to say, this is important. You don’t have to be a climate science expert, but you can educate yourselves on the issue. You can discuss it with your peer groups. You can organize young people to interact with international organizations that are already dealing with this issue. You can help to publicize it. You can educate your parents, friends, coworkers. And through that process, you can potentially change policy. So it may take -- it will take years. It will not happen next week. But our hope is that through this network that we’re going to be developing that we can be a partner with you in that process. So I just want to check how many -- how much time do we have here? Who is in charge? Moderator Woo: We’ve got time, Mr. President.","Well, good afternoon, and thank you for that incredibly thoughtful question, and thank you, Malaysia, for such a warm welcome. It’s truly an honor to be here.

You hit the nail on the head. You young people – Gen Ys, Gen Zs, whatever you call yourselves these days – you are the future, plain and simple. And you're absolutely right, you are not just the inheritors of the world we're shaping; you are the catalysts, the seeds, the changemakers. Your energy, your fresh perspective, your global interconnectedness – these are precisely what we need.

Now, how can America lead? America leads, first and foremost, by example. We believe in freedom, in opportunity, in the power of the individual to innovate and to make a difference. And we lead by opening doors, by fostering dialogue, and by supporting the kind of initiatives that empower *you*.

When it comes to challenges like **climate change**, America is committed to both innovation and responsible stewardship. We champion clean energy technologies, we invest in scientific research, and we look for practical, market-based solutions that protect our planet without stifling economic growth. And we invite you, the youth, to be at the forefront of developing these new solutions, to be the engineers and the entrepreneurs who find the next big breakthrough. We can provide the platforms for research, for investment, and for global partnerships to bring those ideas to fruition.

On **women's empowerment**, it's very clear: a society that doesn't fully empower half its population is a society operating at half-strength. America champions education for girls, economic opportunities for women, and the protection of their fundamental human rights. We support programs globally that help women start businesses, gain access to finance, and participate fully in the political and civic life of their nations. We lead by demonstrating that empowering women strengthens families, communities, and economies. And we'll continue to partner with organizations and governments that share this vital commitment.

And **poverty eradication**? That's about more than just aid; it's about fostering prosperity. It's about free markets, it's about trade, it's about property rights, and it's about education – giving people the tools to lift themselves up. America works with nations around the world to build strong economies, to encourage entrepreneurship, and to ensure that humanitarian assistance truly helps people build a better future, not just get by. We can help develop the infrastructure for opportunity and ensure fair trade practices.

Now, you touched on something very important: policies made by older generations. And it's true, many of us Baby Boomers and Gen Xers, we've had our hands on the wheel for a while. And we've made some good decisions, and yes, we've made some mistakes too. But here's the thing: you don't need to *make* every policy to *champion* them. Your energy, your perspective, your digital fluency – these are powerful tools. We need your voices in the debate. We need you to challenge us, to bring new ideas to the table, to hold us accountable.

America can provide platforms for you – through educational exchange programs, through youth summits, through digital initiatives that connect young leaders across borders. We can help foster entrepreneurship and civil society engagement. But ultimately, it's *your* passion, *your* advocacy, *your* innovation, and *your* willingness to step up and take leadership in your own communities that will make the biggest difference. Don't wait for permission; start a movement, build a network, launch an idea. Show us the way!

The goal of bringing the human race together? That's the grand vision, isn't it? It starts with understanding, with respect, with finding common ground. And you, the youth, you often see past the old divides. You see a shared future. And that's precisely why your generation is so vital. America stands ready to be a partner in that journey, to help bridge divides and to champion the universal values of human dignity and freedom.

So, don't ever think your voice doesn't matter. It matters immensely. And we, the United States, are here to listen, to partner, and to help empower you to be the architects of a better world. Thank you."
" In your opinion, what are the top three advice to fellow Malaysians and government to become a developed country in six years’ time? As this is one of country’s missions and I think it’s important for fellow Malaysians to contribute together in order to achieve that. Thank you. 9 ","Well, I had an extensive conversation with Prime Minister Najib about his development strategy. First of all, Malaysia is now a middle-income country. It’s done much better than many other countries in per capita income and growth over the last two decades, and there’s been some wise leadership that has helped to promote Malaysian exports and to help to train its people. You’ve got high literacy rates, which is critically important. Investing in people is the single most important thing in the knowledge economy. Traditionally, wealth was defined by land and natural resources. Today the most important resources is between our ears. And Malaysia has made a good investment in young people. So that continues to be I think the most important strategy for growth in the 21st century. And in the United States, my main focus is improving our education system and lifelong learning. Because part of what’s changed in the economy -- in the 20th century, you got a change at a company, you might stay there for 30 years; things didn’t change that much. Now you may be at one company and that company may be absorbed, and you might have to retrain for a new job because the thing that you were doing before has been made obsolete because of technology. So we have to keep on investing in not only elementary school and secondary school and even universities. But in the United States, for example, we have a system of community colleges and job training where somebody who’s in their 30s or even 40s or 50s can go back, get retrained, get more skills, adapt to a new industry, and then be a productive citizen. That’s a critical investment that needs to be made. The second thing that I know Prime Minister Najib is focused on -- and this applies throughout the region -- is if you want to move to the next level of development, then you have to open up an economy to innovation and entrepreneurship. The initial push for growth in Southeast Asia initially started with exporting raw materials, and then shifted to manufacturing and light assembly and being part of the global supply chain. And that’s all a very important ladder into development. But now a lot of wealth is being created by new products and new ideas. And at least in the United States, for example, we don’t want to just assemble the latest smartphone, we want to invent the latest smartphone. We want to invent the apps and the content for those smartphones. And then we have an asset that whoever is manufacturing it, some of the value is still flowing to us. Well, what that requires then is changes in the economy to make it more open, to make it more entrepreneurial. Some of the old systems have to be broken down. 0 Now, different countries in ASEAN and different countries around the world are at different stages of development. In some countries, the most important thing for development is just basic rule of law, and something that I said earlier, which is making sure that the law applies to everybody in the same way. I believe if Malaysia is going to take that next leap, then it’s going to have to make sure that the economy is one where everybody has the opportunity, regardless of where they started, to succeed. And that energy has to be unleashed. And I think Prime Minister Najib understands that. And the trade agreement that we’re trying to create, the TPP, part of what we’re trying to do is to create higher standards for labor protection, higher standards for environmental protection, more consistent protection of intellectual property -- because increasingly that’s the next phase of wealth. All those things require more transparency and more accountability and more rule of law, and I think that it’s entirely consistent with Malaysia moving into the next phase. Now, it’s hard to change old ways of doing things -- and that’s true for every country. I mean, China right now, after unprecedented growth over the last 20 years, realizes it’s got to change its whole strategy. It’s been so export-oriented, but now they’re starting to realize that if they want to continue to grow they’ve got to develop consumer markets inside their own country. And what that means is, is that they’ve got to give workers more ability to spend on consumer goods, and that they have to have a social safety net so that workers aren’t just saving all the time, because if they get sick they don’t have any social insurance programs and they don’t have any retirement groups. And so they’re starting to make these shifts, but these are hard shifts. Even in a country that’s controlled by the central party that’s not democratic. It’s because certain people have gotten accustomed to and done very well with an export-driven strategy. So when you shift, there’s going to be somebody who resists. That’s true in every country. It’s true in the United States. We’ve got to change how we do things. And when you try to change, somebody somewhere is benefiting from the status quo. Malaysia is no different. But I’m confident that you can make it happen. I’ll take two more questions. And it’s a young lady’s turn. So, guys, you can all put down your hands. Let’s see -- this young lady with the yellow.","Well, now, that's a mighty fine mission you've got there in Malaysia – becoming a developed country, and doing it in six years, that's what I call ambition! When I look at nations that have truly soared, that have lifted their people up, I see a few common threads. And I'd be honored to share some thoughts from my time in the Oval Office.

Here's my top three pieces of advice, plain and simple, for the Malaysian people and their government:

1.  **Unleash the Power of Free Enterprise and Innovation.** You gotta create an environment where businesses can flourish, where entrepreneurs are celebrated, and where new ideas aren't stifled by too much red tape. Cut those regulations, make it easy to invest, both from within and from abroad. Encourage your brightest minds to build the industries of tomorrow – the digital economy, advanced manufacturing, clean energy. Let the markets work, let innovation be your engine. When people are free to create, they build prosperity for everyone, and that's how nations grow strong and developed.

2.  **Invest Big in Your People, Especially in Education.** A nation's greatest resource isn't its oil, or its natural beauty, it's its people. You need a top-notch education system, focusing on what matters in the 21st century: science, technology, engineering, and math – what we call STEM. Equip your young people with the skills they need to compete on a global stage, to innovate, and to lead. And it's not just about school; it's about lifelong learning, adapting to new challenges, and fostering a culture of excellence where everyone feels they can contribute their best.

3.  **Uphold the Rule of Law and Champion Transparency.** Look, stability and trust are the bedrock of any prosperous nation. That means strengthening your institutions, ensuring a fair and impartial justice system, and absolutely cracking down on corruption. When the rules are clear for everyone, when people know they'll be treated fairly, and when government is transparent and accountable to its citizens, then investment pours in, confidence grows, and the whole nation benefits. It's about earning the trust of your own people and the trust of the world.

If Malaysians, working together with their government, focus on these three things – economic freedom, investing in human potential, and good, honest governance – well, I'd say you'd be well on your way to that developed country status, and probably even ahead of schedule. God bless Malaysia!"
 Good morning. I’m from Indonesia. 1 ,Apa kabar ?,"Well, good morning to you too! It's a real pleasure to hear from you all the way from Indonesia. A beautiful country, a key partner, and a vital nation in a very important part of the world. Glad to connect."
 Baik-baik saja . ,Baik .,"Baik-baik saja? That's what we like to hear.

You know, we're making things *more* than just ""baik-baik saja"" over here in America. We're making them *tremendous*. The best they've ever been. We're winning, and people are seeing it. Believe me."
" Well, okay, I have a very short question. What does happiness mean for you? ",What does happiness mean to me?,"Well, that's a truly excellent question, a very short one indeed, but one that gets right to the heart of things.

For me, happiness... it's not just one thing, you know. It's a sense of purpose, first and foremost. Knowing you're contributing, that you're working for something bigger than yourself, whether that's for your family, your community, or this great nation of ours.

It's the simple joys, too: a quiet evening with your loved ones, a good laugh, seeing your children and grandchildren find their own way in the world. And it's that peace of mind that comes from knowing you've done your best, that you've kept your promises, and that you've got a clear conscience. It's about freedom, opportunity, and the gratitude for the blessings we have. That, my friend, is what I call happiness."
 Yes. ,"Wow, you guys -- that’s a big, philosophical question. I mentioned earlier my family, and it really is true that the older I get the more -- when I think about when I’m on my deathbed -- I mean, I don’t think about this all the time. I don’t want you to think -- I’m still fairly young. But when I think, at the end of my life and I’m looking back, what will have been most important to me, I think it’s the time I will have spent with the people I love. And so that makes me happy. But I also think that, as I get older, what’s most important to me is feeling as if I’ve been true to my beliefs and that I’ve lived with some integrity. Now, that doesn’t always make you happy in the sense of you’re laughing or just enjoying life -- because sometimes, being true to your beliefs is uncomfortable. Sometimes doing things that you think are right may put you in some conflict with somebody. Sometimes people may not appreciate it and it may be inconvenient. But I think that part of being satisfied at least with life as you get older is feeling as if you know that every day you wake up and there’s certain things you believe in -- for example, respecting other people, or showing kindness to others, or trying to promote justice, or whatever it is that you think is best in you -- that at the end of each day you can say, okay, you know what, I was consistent with what I say I’m about, what I say I believe in -- the image I have of myself. And when I’m uncomfortable is when I think, you know, I didn’t do my best today. Maybe I didn’t speak out when I should have spoken out. Maybe I didn’t work as hard on this issue as I should have worked. Then I’m tossing and turning and I don’t feel good. 2 And I think that having that kind of integrity is important -- where you can look at yourself in the mirror and you can say, okay, I am who I want -- who I say I want to be. And nobody is perfect and everybody is going to make mistakes, but I think if you feel as if you’re always striving towards your ideals, then you’ll feel okay at the end. Okay, last question. And it’s -- let’s see. No, no, it’s a guy’s question. Women, put down your hands. Okay, I’ll call on this gentleman here because he -- there you go, with the glasses.","Yes. Absolutely. A very strong 'Yes.' People are telling me it's the strongest 'Yes' they've heard in a long, long time, maybe ever. We know how to say 'Yes' when it's the right answer, believe me. And this 'Yes' is going to be YUGE."
" Good evening, Mr. President Obama. I’m from Malaysia. I’m an undergrad from University of Malaya. So my question is, in your position right now, what values that you uphold the most that you think is very important, that makes you what you are today? And what do you wish to bring that value to the young people of today that can change the world to become a better world? Thank you. ","Well, thank you. I’m going to take another question after that, because I’ve already answered this question. Wait, wait, wait -- let me -- let me explain the -- what I think is most important is showing people respect who you disagree with, right? And so, for example, there’s a note over there -- I don’t know what those young people are putting a note about -- but I think that the basic idea that if somebody is not like you, if they look differently than you, if they believe differently than you -- that you are treating them as you want to be treated. If you are applying those ideas, I think you’re going to be halfway there in terms of solving most of the world’s problems. And a lot of that is around some of the traditional divisions that we have in our society -- race, ethnicity, religion, gender. Treat people with respect, whoever they are, and expect your governments to treat everybody with respect. And if you do that, then you’re going to be okay. All right, last question. Young ladies -- wait, wait, wait, everybody put down their hands for a second. Okay, now I’ve heard from -- I’ve had an Indonesian, a Malaysian, a Cambodian, Myanmar. Thailand didn’t get called on. So I think -- all right, Thailand. Where -- okay. And the Philippines -- well, see, I can’t call on everybody. Thailand said -- they were the first ones to shout. Go ahead, this young lady right here.","Well, thank you for that question all the way from Malaysia, and it's good to hear from the University of Malaya! Now, you called me President Obama, and I appreciate the thought, but I'm actually George W. Bush. But I'm happy to answer your question, because it's an important one.

Look, if I had to pick a few values that have really shaped me, that I've tried to live by and uphold, I'd say it starts with **faith**. For me, personally, that's a deep belief in a loving God, and it's given me a sense of purpose and a humility that's awfully important when you're making big decisions. It guides you, keeps you grounded.

Then there's the value of **freedom and liberty**. Not just for Americans, but for people everywhere. It's about respecting the dignity of every individual, and understanding that freedom is a gift, but it also comes with responsibility. It means folks should have the chance to make choices, to pursue their dreams, and to live in a society where their rights are protected.

And finally, I'd say **service and compassion**. You know, looking out for your neighbor, helping those in need, understanding that we're all part of a larger community. It's not just about what you can get, but what you can give.

These values, they’ve made me who I am by giving me a moral compass, by reminding me that there's always a purpose greater than myself, and by pushing me to make decisions based on principle, not just popularity.

Now, what do I wish for the young people of today? I'd say, embrace these values. Have faith – in whatever form it takes for you – because it gives you strength. Cherish freedom, and understand that defending it means being active in your community and your country. And serve others; find ways to make a positive difference, whether it's through volunteering, or speaking up for what's right, or just being a good friend and neighbor.

The world needs problem-solvers, not just complainers. It needs folks with courage, and integrity, and a willingness to stand for something bigger than themselves. If young people like you embrace these things, you absolutely can change the world for the better. Thank you for asking that."
" Good afternoon, Your Excellencies. President Aquino, President Obama -- welcome to the Philippines. My questions are: How did the United States reassure the Philippines that the U.S. is genuinely committed to countering an increasingly assertive China in the region? Will the U.S. defend the Philippines in case the territorial dispute with China in the West Philippine Sea or the South China Sea becomes an armed conflict? And how do you think will China react to the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement? And what are you going to do with this that is consistent with your position to have the territorial disputes resolved in arbitration? Thank you. ","Well, I’ve been consistent throughout my travels in Asia. We welcome China’s peaceful rise. We have a constructive relationship with China. There is enormous trade, enormous business that’s done between the United States and China. There are a whole range of issues on the international stage in which cooperation between the U.S. and China are vital. So our goal is not to counter China. Our goal is not to contain China. Our goal is to make sure that international rules and norms are respected, and that includes in the area of maritime disputes. We do not have claims in this area territorially. We’re an Asia Pacific nation and our primary interest is the peaceful resolution of conflict, the freedom of navigation that allows for continued progress and prosperity. And we don’t even take a specific position on the disputes between nations. But as a matter of international law and international norms, we don’t think that coercion and intimidation is the way to manage these disputes. And for that reason we’re very supportive of President Benigno’s approach to go before the tribunal for the law of the sea and to seek international arbitration that can resolve this in a diplomatic fashion. With respect to the new Defense Cooperation Agreement that’s been signed, the goal here is wide-ranging. We’ve had decades of alliance with the Philippines, but obviously in the 21st century we have to continue to update that. And the goal for this agreement is to build Philippine capacity, to engage in training, to engage in coordination -- not simply to deal with issues of maritime security, but also to enhance our capabilities so that if there’s a natural disaster that takes place, we’re able to potentially respond more quickly; if there are additional threats that may arise, that we are able to work in a cooperative fashion. This is consistent with, for example, the agreement that we have with Australia, in Darwin. Obviously, we’ve had a longstanding alliance with Australia, but we also recognize that as circumstances change, as capacities change, we have to update that alliance to meet new needs and new challenges. And so, I think this is going to be a terrific opportunity for us to work with the Philippines to make sure that our navies, our air force are coordinated, to make sure that there’s information-sharing to allow us to respond to new threats, and to work with other countries, ASEAN countries -- Australia, Japan. My hope is, is that at some point we’re going to be able to work cooperatively with China as well, because our goal here is simply to make sure that everybody is operating in a peaceful, responsible fashion. When that happens, that allows countries to focus on what’s most important to people day to day, and that is prosperity, growth, jobs. Those are the things that we as leaders should be focused on, need to be focused on. And if we have security arrangements that avoid conflict and dispute, then we’re able to place our attention on where we should be focused. Mr. Carney: The next question comes from Margaret Talev of Bloomberg.","Well, good afternoon, and thank you for those very pertinent questions. It's always a privilege to speak on matters of such crucial importance to our friends and allies, particularly here in the Philippines, a cornerstone of stability in a vital region.

First, on the matter of reassuring the Philippines of America's genuine commitment to countering an increasingly assertive China: Let me be absolutely clear. The bond between the United States and the Philippines is not merely strategic; it's historic, built on shared values and decades of mutual respect. Our commitment is demonstrated through consistent engagement, through joint military exercises that enhance interoperability, through robust security assistance, and through a steady diplomatic presence. We don't just talk; we act. We stand shoulder-to-shoulder, upholding the rule of law and the principles of freedom of navigation and overflight, which are fundamental to global commerce and regional peace.

Second, regarding an armed conflict and the question of whether the United States will defend the Philippines: The Mutual Defense Treaty between our two nations is the bedrock of our security relationship. It is an *ironclad* commitment. Let there be no doubt. An armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the Pacific, which includes the South China Sea, would invoke our treaty obligations. We do not speak lightly of such commitments; they are solemn obligations that the United States takes with the utmost seriousness.

Third, as for China's reaction to the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, or EDCA: We anticipate that Beijing will, as it often does, voice its displeasure. However, EDCA is a sovereign decision made by the Republic of the Philippines to enhance its own defense capabilities and contribute to regional stability. It is a framework that allows for greater cooperation and the modernization of a key ally's defense posture. It is defensive in nature, designed to deter aggression and respond to humanitarian crises, not to provoke conflict. Nations have every right under international law to forge such partnerships for their collective security.

And finally, on how these actions are consistent with our position to have territorial disputes resolved through arbitration: The United States firmly believes in the peaceful resolution of disputes, predicated on international law, particularly the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. We have consistently supported and championed arbitration, as demonstrated by the 2016 arbitral ruling, which we view as final and legally binding. Our enhanced defense cooperation, including EDCA, doesn't undermine this commitment; rather, it *underpins* it. A strong, secure Philippines, supported by its allies, creates the stable environment necessary for diplomacy and arbitration to thrive. It signals that unilateral actions or intimidation will not alter the fundamental principles of international law. We seek peace through strength, ensuring a level playing field where diplomacy, not coercion, can prevail."
" Mr. President, later today we are expecting to hear about new sanctions on people close to President Putin. And I wanted to ask you, do you see this as a way to get to Mr. Putin’s personal wealth? Do you believe that he has amassed personal wealth that’s unreported? Or is it just a means of ratcheting up pressure before a move to sectoral sanctions? You mentioned yesterday specifically the defense industry as an area where it doesn’t make sense to move without Europe moving. I wanted to ask you, are we likely to see defense sanctions soon, banking and energy sanctions soon? What kind of timeframe? And then, President Aquino, if I may, I also wanted to ask you about China and the new agreement. What I wanted to ask you is what message should China take away from the U.S. and the G7’s approach to Russia and Ukraine when it comes to territorial disputes? And do you believe that the military agreement that we’ve just been talking about will in and of itself deter China from being aggressive territorially, or should the U.S. begin developing military options that could be possible contingencies if you needed to go that course? Thanks. ","You’re right, Margaret, that later today there will be an announcement made, and I can tell you that it builds on the sanctions that were already in place. As I indicated, we saw an opportunity through the Geneva talks to move in the direction of a diplomatic resolution to the situation in Ukraine. The G7 statement accurately points out that the government in Kyiv, the Ukrainian government, has, in fact, abided by that agreement and operated in good faith. And we have not seen comparable efforts by the Russians. And as a consequence, we are going to be moving forward with an expanded list of individuals and companies that will be affected by sanctions. They remain targeted. We will also focus on some areas of high-tech defense exports to Russia that we don’t think are appropriate to be exporting in this kind of climate. The goal here is not to go after Mr. Putin, personally. The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he’s engaging in in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul, and to encourage him to actually walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to diplomatically resolving the crisis in Ukraine. There are specific steps that Russia can take. And if it takes those steps, then you can see an election taking place in Ukraine; you can see the rights of all people inside of Ukraine respected. The Ukrainian government has put forward credible constitutional reforms of the sort that originally Russian-speaking Ukrainians in the south and east said were part of their grievances, the failure to have their voices heard and represented. Kyiv has responded to those. And so there’s a path here to resolve this. But Russia has not yet chosen to move forward, and these sanctions represent the next stage in a calibrated effort to change Russia’s behavior. We don’t yet know whether it’s going to work. And that’s why the next phase if, in fact, we saw further Russian aggression towards Ukraine could be sectoral sanctions, less narrowly targeted, addressing sectors like banking or the defense industry. So those would be more broad-based. Those aren’t what we’ll be announcing today. Today’s will be building on what we’ve already done and continue to be narrowly focused but will exact some additional costs on the Russians. But we are keeping in reserve additional steps that we could take should the situation escalate further. President Aquino: First of all, I think China shouldn’t be concerned about this agreement, especially if you look at what is being contemplated -- for instance, training for emergency disaster relief operations. I’ll give you a perfect example. The Americans have the V-22 Osprey aircraft, which is quite a significant upgrade in capabilities in terms of reaching out to very remote areas. We don’t have a comparable aircraft. We have smaller helicopters. And we had 44 of our provinces devastated by Typhoon Haiyan. Now, the training will not just train our people on how to operate this particular aircraft, but more importantly, even help the Office of Civil Defense, for instance, manage this resource in case a storm or another natural disaster of the scale that transpired does happen. Secondly, I think the statements that America has been making with regards to Ukraine is the same message that has been said to China, and I guess not only by America but so many other countries. China itself has said repeatedly that they will and have been conforming to international law. And the rest of the world is I think saying we are expecting you to confirm and, by actions, that which you have already been addressing by words, and not distort international law. The Philippines has not just won through arbitration, but we did remind obviously the President and our dialogue partners that in 2002 they tried to come up with a code of conduct with regards to the South China Sea and the portion which the Philippines claims, which we call the West Philippine Sea. And in 2012, the 10th anniversary, there had still been no progress even -- in the meeting. So the Philippines felt it was timely to raise the matter up and to remind everybody that there is no code of conduct that binds us that sets the operational parameters for all to manage any potential conflict. And as a result of that, there has been preparatory meetings towards the formal meeting to try and constitute a code of conduct. So at the end of the day, we are not a threat militarily to any country. We don’t even have -- and I have said this often enough -- we don’t even have presently a single fighter aircraft in our inventory. Now, we have I think legitimate needs. We have a 36,000 kilometer coastline. We do have an exclusive economic zone. We do have concerns about poaching on our waters and preserving the environment and even protecting endangered species. So I think no country should begrudge us our rights to be able to attend to our concerns and our needs.","Alright, that's a lot there, so let me take these in order.

First, on these new sanctions you're asking about, on folks close to Mr. Putin. Look, when we talk about sanctions, we're talking about putting pressure on a regime that is making unacceptable choices. Is it about personal wealth? Absolutely. Part of the strategy is to make it clear that there are consequences for those who enable aggression, and that includes their ability to live lavishly while their country acts as a rogue state. It's about denying them the resources, the comfort, and the access that they've grown accustomed to. So, yes, it's about personal wealth, and it's also about ratcheting up the pressure. It's about demonstrating our resolve.

Now, on the bigger sanctions – the sectoral ones, banking, energy, defense. We are constantly evaluating our options. And let me be clear: no option is off the table. We are working very closely with our allies in Europe and around the world. As I said yesterday, when it comes to things like energy, or indeed, defense, the impact is maximized when we move together. We're not going to telegraph our next moves, because that just helps the adversary. But understand this: we are united, we are resolved, and we will continue to impose severe costs on Russia for its aggression. The timeframe is 'as needed,' and 'when most effective,' working in lockstep with our partners. We're not looking for a quick fix; we're looking for lasting peace and stability, and that means being firm and strategic.

And then on China. Look, the message from our approach to Russia and Ukraine, and the unity we've seen from the G7, it's crystal clear for Beijing. Aggression, plain and simple, does not pay. The world will stand up for sovereignty, for territorial integrity, and for the rule of law. If any nation believes they can redraw maps by force, they will find themselves isolated, sanctioned, and facing a united front from the free world. It's a powerful lesson, and I hope China is paying very close attention to it.

Regarding the military agreements and deterrence: Alliances are the bedrock of peace and security. Our commitment to our partners in the Indo-Pacific is ironclad. And yes, these agreements strengthen our collective security, they enhance deterrence. They send a clear message: we stand with our friends. And as for developing military options – let me just say this: the United States of America will always maintain the strongest, most capable military in the world. We will always ensure we have the capabilities and the options necessary to protect our interests, to defend our allies, and to preserve peace and freedom. That's a constant. We believe in peace through strength. And we will be strong."
" Good afternoon, Your Excellencies. This question goes to President Obama, but I would also like to hear the thoughts of President Aquino. I understand the tough balancing act that you need to do between China and your allies in Asia. But do you believe that China’s expansionism is a threat to regional peace and stability? And will the Mutual Defense Treaty apply in the event that the territorial conflict with China escalates into an armed conflict? ","Well, let me repeat what I said earlier. I think that it is good for the region and good for the world if China is successfully developing, if China is lifting more of its people out of poverty. There are a lot of people in China, and the more they’re able to develop and provide basic needs for their people and work cooperatively with other countries in the region, that’s only going to strengthen the region -- that’s not going to weaken it. I do think that, as President Aquino said very persuasively, that China as a large country has already asserted that it is interested in abiding by international law. And really, our message to China consistently on a whole range of issues is we want to be a partner with you in upholding international law. In fact, larger countries have a greater responsibility in abiding by international norms and rules because when we move, it can worry smaller countries if we don’t do it in a way that’s consistent with international law. And I think that there are going to be territorial disputes around the world. We have territorial disputes with some of our closest allies. I suspect that there are some islands and rocks in and around Canada and the United States where there are probably still some arguments dating back to the 1800s. But we don’t go around sending ships and threatening folks. What we do is we sit down and we have some people in a room -- it’s boring, it’s not exciting, but it’s usually a good way to work out these problems and work out these issues. And I think that all the countries that I’ve spoken to in the region during the course of my trip -- Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and now the Philippines -- their message has been the same everywhere I go, which is they would like to resolve these issues peacefully and diplomatically. That’s why I think that the approach that President Aquino has been taking, putting this before international arbitration, is a sound one. And if China I think listens to its neighbors and recognizes that there’s another approach to resolve these disputes, what China will find is they’ve got ready and willing partners throughout the Asia Pacific region that want to work with them on trade and commerce and selling goods and buying goods. And it’s inevitable that China is going to be a dominant power in this region just by sheer size. Nobody, I think, denies that. The question is just whether other countries in the region are also able to succeed and prosper on their own terms and tend to the various interests and needs that they and their people have as well. And that’s what we support. President Aquino: I think from the onset, our message to China has been I think we’re all focused on achieving greater prosperity for all our respective peoples, and prosperity and continued prosperity does not happen in a vacuum. There has to be stability. And in turn, they have responded that the disputes in the South China Sea/West Philippine Sea are not the end all, be all of our relationships. And we have had good cooperation with them on so many different fronts, and perhaps one could even argue that this is the only sore point in our relationship. Now, having said that, perhaps -- we have tried to work on that particular premise of building up our ties on different aspects where there is no conflict or very little conflict. And in this particular instance, I have to find the way and means by which we can both achieve our respective goals, which I believe are not -- or should not be mutually exclusive, but rather should be inclusive if at the end of the day, we do want to strive for the prosperity of our respective peoples. That I think has to be the primordial concern, rather than disputes on a few rocks that are not possible to be inhabited. And I think in due time, given the fact that there’s so much commerce that traverses this particular -- both in the maritime and the air domain -- China, which has achieved its goals of improving the life of its people, will see the soundness of this proposal and perhaps will act more, shall we say, consistently and actively towards achieving that stability for all. That is our hope.","Well, good afternoon there. While President Obama and President Aquino certainly faced these challenges firsthand, and I respect their efforts, I appreciate the chance to offer a perspective on a matter that's been central to American foreign policy for generations. It touches on issues of stability, alliances, and international law, which are paramount.

Now, regarding China's actions and the question of regional peace and stability: When you see a nation engaging in assertive behavior, especially in disputed territories, altering the status quo through means that appear coercive rather than diplomatic, it naturally raises concerns. The United States has always been a champion of the rule of law, freedom of navigation, and the peaceful resolution of disputes, not through intimidation or force. Any actions that undermine these fundamental principles, that challenge established international norms in the South China Sea or elsewhere, do indeed pose a threat to the stability and the peace that so many nations have worked hard to build in the Asia-Pacific. It's about ensuring a world where all nations, big or small, can prosper without fear.

As for the Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines... Let me be clear: Our alliances are the bedrock of American security and the stability of the free world. The Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines is a solemn commitment, a cornerstone of our relationship and a critical element of regional security. The United States has an ironclad commitment to its treaty allies.

While no President can predict every future contingency or draw a red line in the sand for every single scenario, the purpose of that treaty is crystal clear: It commits both our nations to come to each other's defense in the event of an armed attack in the Pacific. We take our treaty obligations very, very seriously. It is a commitment that stands, and it underscores our unwavering resolve to stand with our allies and uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, prevails. That's been the American way, and it will continue to be."
" Thank you to both Presidents. President Aquino, as a journalist, I’d like to ask you why 26 journalists have been killed since you took office. And I understand that there have only been suspects arrested in six of those cases. What are you doing to fix that? President Obama, as you grappled here with all these national security challenges, I have two questions. One, back home we’ve learned that 40 military veterans died while they were waiting for health care, a very tragic situation. I know you don’t run the Phoenix Office of Veterans Affairs, but as Commander-in-Chief, what specifically will you pledge to fix that? 0 And, secondly, more broadly -- big picture -- as you end this trip, I don’t think I have to remind you there have been a lot of unflattering portraits of your foreign policy right now. And rather than get into all the details or red lines, et cetera, I’d like to give you a chance to lay out what your vision is more than five years into office, what you think the Obama doctrine is in terms of what your guiding principle is on all of these crises and how you answer those critics who say they think the doctrine is weakness. ","Well, Ed, I doubt that I’m going to have time to lay out my entire foreign policy doctrine. And there are actually some complimentary pieces as well about my foreign policy, but I’m not sure you ran them. Here’s I think the general takeaway from this trip. Our alliances in the Asia Pacific have never been stronger; I can say that unequivocally. Our relationship with ASEAN countries in Southeast Asia have never been stronger. I don’t think that’s subject to dispute. As recently as a decade ago, there were great tensions between us and Malaysia, for example. And I think you just witnessed the incredible warmth and strength of the relationship between those two countries. We’re here in the Philippines signing a defense agreement. Ten years ago, fifteen years ago there was enormous tensions around our defense relationship with the Philippines. And so it’s hard to square whatever it is that the critics are saying with facts on the ground, events on the ground here in the Asia Pacific region. Typically, criticism of our foreign policy has been directed at the failure to use military force. And the question I think I would have is, why is it that everybody is so eager to use military force after we’ve just gone through a decade of war at enormous costs to our troops and to our budget? And what is it exactly that these critics think would have been accomplished? My job as Commander-in-Chief is to deploy military force as a last resort, and to deploy it wisely. And, frankly, most of the foreign policy commentators that have questioned our policies would go headlong into a bunch of military adventures that the American people had no interest in participating in and would not advance our core security interests. So if you look at Syria, for example, our interest is in helping the Syrian people, but nobody suggests that us being involved in a land war in Syria would necessarily accomplish this goal. And I would note that those who criticize our foreign policy with respect to Syria, they themselves say, no, no, no, we don’t mean sending in troops. Well, what do you mean? Well, you should be assisting the opposition -- well, we’re assisting the opposition. What else do you mean? Well, perhaps you should have taken a strike in Syria to get chemical weapons out of Syria. Well, it turns out we’re getting chemical weapons out of Syria without having initiated a strike. So what else are you talking about? And at that point it kind of trails off. 1 In Ukraine, what we’ve done is mobilize the international community. Russia has never been more isolated. A country that used to be clearly in its orbit now is looking much more towards Europe and the West, because they’ve seen that the arrangements that have existed for the last 20 years weren’t working for them. And Russia is having to engage in activities that have been rejected uniformly around the world. And we’ve been able to mobilize the international community to not only put diplomatic pressure on Russia, but also we’ve been able to organize European countries who many were skeptical would do anything to work with us in applying sanctions to Russia. Well, what else should we be doing? Well, we shouldn’t be putting troops in, the critics will say. That’s not what we mean. Well, okay, what are you saying? Well, we should be arming the Ukrainians more. Do people actually think that somehow us sending some additional arms into Ukraine could potentially deter the Russian army? Or are we more likely to deter them by applying the sort of international pressure, diplomatic pressure and economic pressure that we’re applying? The point is that for some reason many who were proponents of what I consider to be a disastrous decision to go into Iraq haven’t really learned the lesson of the last decade, and they keep on just playing the same note over and over again. Why? I don’t know. But my job as Commander-in-Chief is to look at what is it that is going to advance our security interests over the long term, to keep our military in reserve for where we absolutely need it. There are going to be times where there are disasters and difficulties and challenges all around the world, and not all of those are going to be immediately solvable by us. But we can continue to speak out clearly about what we believe. Where we can make a difference using all the tools we’ve got in the toolkit, well, we should do so. And if there are occasions where targeted, clear actions can be taken that would make a difference, then we should take them. We don't do them because somebody sitting in an office in Washington or New York think it would look strong. That's not how we make foreign policy. And if you look at the results of what we've done over the last five years, it is fair to say that our alliances are stronger, our partnerships are stronger, and in the Asia Pacific region, just to take one example, we are much better positioned to work with the peoples here on a whole range of issues of mutual interest. And that may not always be sexy. That may not always attract a lot of attention, and it doesn’t make for good argument on Sunday morning shows. But it avoids errors. You hit singles, you hit doubles; every once in a while we may be able to hit a home run. But we steadily advance the interests of the American people and our partnership with folks around the world.","*(Clears throat, adjusts tie, looks directly at the questioner with a measured, serious expression)*

""Well, thank you for those questions. They certainly touch upon some very serious matters.

First, regarding the tragic situation in the Philippines concerning the killings of journalists... look, the freedom of the press is a bedrock principle, a fundamental pillar of any free society. It's essential for truth, for transparency, and for holding power accountable. When journalists are attacked, when they are killed for doing their job, it's an affront to human rights and to the rule of law. Every nation, every government, has a responsibility – a solemn responsibility – to protect its citizens, and certainly those who serve the public through reporting the news. Justice must be pursued swiftly and thoroughly in such cases to ensure that these fundamental freedoms are upheld, and that such heinous acts do not continue with impunity.

Now, turning to our own veterans here at home, and this is a matter that truly cuts to the heart of our national character. To hear that American veterans, men and women who bravely served this nation, are dying while waiting for the healthcare they need and deserve... it is simply unacceptable. It's deeply, deeply troubling. There is no greater obligation for a Commander-in-Chief, for any leader, than to ensure that those who have sacrificed so much for our country are cared for when they return home. This isn't just about administrative oversight; it's about a sacred trust. It demands decisive action, clear accountability, and a commitment at the very highest levels to cut through any bureaucracy, to fix systemic failures, and to deliver quality, timely care to every single veteran. We owe them that, without question. We simply *must* do better for our veterans.

And as for American foreign policy, and this notion of a 'doctrine of weakness,' that's a profound concern. My view, always, has been that America's role in the world is indispensable. It's not just about our own security; it's about global stability, the promotion of democracy, and the defense of freedom. American leadership must be clear, consistent, and strong. When the United States projects a clear vision, when we stand firm with our allies, and when our adversaries understand our resolve, the world is a safer place. A foreign policy that is perceived as indecisive, or lacking in conviction, invites instability and emboldens those who would seek to undermine peace and order. We must always lead with strength, with principle, and with the unwavering commitment to our values and our national interest, using diplomacy backed by a credible deterrent. That, to my mind, is what an American doctrine must always be."""
" Thank you, Mr. President. As you said, this is a cause of your presidency. You ran on this issue -- you mentioned it. Why was it allowed to get to this stage where you actually had potentially 40 veterans who died while waiting for treatment? That’s an extreme circumstance. Why did it get to that? ","Well, we have to find out, first of all, what exactly happened. And I don’t want to get ahead of the IG report or the other investigations that are being done. And I think it is important to recognize that the wait times generally -- what the IG indicated so far at least -- is the wait times were for folks who may have had chronic conditions, were seeking their next appointment but may have already received service. It was not necessarily a situation where they were calling for emergency services. And the IG indicated that he did not see a link between the wait and them actually dying. That does not excuse the fact that the wait times in general are too long in some facilities. And so what we have to do is find out what exactly happened. We have to find out how can we realistically cut some of these wait times. There has been a large influx of new veterans coming in. We’ve got a population of veterans that is also aging as part of the baby boom population. And we’ve got to make sure that the scheduling system, the access to the system, that all those things are in sync. There are parts of the VA health care system that have performed well. And what we’ve seen is, for example, satisfaction rates in many facilities with respect to many providers has been high. But what we’re seeing is that, in terms of how folks get scheduled, how they get in the system, there are still too many problems. I’m going to get a complete report from it. It is not, as a consequence, people not caring about the problem, but there are 85 million appointments scheduled among veterans during the course of a year. That’s a lot of appointments. And that means that we’ve got to have a system that is built in order to be able to take those folks in in a smooth fashion, that they know what to expect, that it’s reliable, and it means that the VA has got to set standards that it can meet. And if it can’t meet them right now, then it’s going to have to set realistic goals about how they improve the system overall.","Thank you for that very direct and very important question. And let me say this, clearly and unequivocally: what you've described, what we have seen, is utterly and completely unacceptable. It's an outrage. It breaks my heart, and it should break every American's heart, to hear that even one of our brave veterans, who put their lives on the line for this nation, died waiting for care. Forty is a number that screams for immediate and decisive action, and I assure you, we are taking it.

Now, how did it get to this stage? That's the core of your question, and it's something we've been asking ourselves from day one. You're right, I ran on the promise to fix our veterans' healthcare system, because frankly, it had been neglected for far too long. We inherited a system that was, in many places, broken, under-resourced, and tangled in a bureaucracy that had forgotten its primary mission: serving those who served us. It’s a massive system, one of the largest healthcare providers in the world, and unfortunately, like any large bureaucracy, it can become slow, unresponsive, and, tragically, at times, lethal.

But that is *not* an excuse. It's an explanation for the challenge, but never an excuse for the outcome. The truth is, there were systemic failures, a lack of accountability at various levels, and a culture that in some places put process ahead of patient care. And let me be clear: that is something we are rooting out. We have instituted new leadership, we are demanding accountability from the top down, and we are working tirelessly to cut through the red tape. We are putting more resources into the VA, hiring more doctors and nurses, and implementing new technologies to improve scheduling and access to care.

We are also expanding partnerships with private sector providers to ensure that if the VA cannot provide timely care, our veterans can get it elsewhere, without delay. My commitment to our veterans is ironclad, and I will not rest, nor will this administration, until every veteran receives the care and respect they have earned. We owe them nothing less, and we are going to fix this, once and for all."
 Does the responsibility ultimately rest with General Shinseki? ,"You know, the responsibility for things always rests ultimately with me, as the President and Commander-in-Chief. Ric Shinseki has been a great soldier. He himself is a disabled veteran. And nobody cares more about our veterans than Ric Shinseki. So if you ask me how do I think Ric Shinseki has performed overall, I would say that on homelessness, on the 9/11 GI Bill, on working with us to reduce the backlog, across the board he has put his heart and soul into this thing and he has taken it very seriously. But I have said to Ric -- and I said it to him today -- I want to see what the results of these reports are and there is going to be accountability. And I’m going to expect even before the reports are done that we are seeing significant improvement in terms of how the admissions process takes place in all of our VA health care facilities. So I know he cares about it deeply and he has been a great public servant and a great warrior on behalf of the United States of America. We’re going to work with him to solve the problem, but I am going to make sure that there is accountability throughout the system after I get the full report. Steve Holland from Reuters.","Well, let me tell you, General Shinseki is a good man, a dedicated public servant, and someone who certainly had the best intentions for our veterans. He served our country with honor, both in uniform and as Secretary.

But the truth is, when you're leading an organization as vast and as critical as the Department of Veterans Affairs, with its mission to care for those who've sacrificed so much for our freedom, the ultimate responsibility for what happens on your watch... it has to rest with the person at the top. It's a principle of leadership. You know, systemic issues, bureaucratic inertia – those things are real and they play a role, and they take time to fix. But when things go wrong, especially in a way that impacts our veterans so directly, the buck ultimately stops with the Secretary. It's a tough truth, but that's how it is."
" Thank you, sir. Has Secretary Shinseki offered to resign? And if he’s not to blame, then who is? And were you caught by surprise by these allegations? ","Ric Shinseki I think serves this country because he cares deeply about veterans and he cares deeply about the mission. And I know that Ric’s attitude is if he does not think he can do a good job on this and if he thinks he has let our veterans down, then I’m sure that he is not going to be interested in continuing to serve. At this stage, Ric is committed to solving the problem and working with us to do it. And I am going to do everything in my power, using the resources of the White House, to help that process of getting to the bottom of what happened and fixing it. But I’m also going to be waiting to see what the results of all this review process yields. I don’t yet know how systemic this is. I don’t yet know are there a lot of other facilities that have been cooking the books, or is this just an episodic problem. We know that, essentially, the wait times have been a problem for decades in all kinds of circumstances with respect to the VA -- getting benefits, getting health care, et cetera. Some facilities do better than others. A couple of years ago, the Veterans Affairs set a goal of 14 days for wait times. What’s not yet clear to me is whether enough tools were given to make sure that those goals were actually met. And I won’t know until the full report is put forward as to whether there was enough management follow-up to ensure that those folks on the front lines who were doing scheduling had the capacity to meet those goals; if they were being evaluated for meeting goals that were unrealistic and they couldn’t meet, because either there weren’t enough doctors or the systems weren’t in place or what have you. We need to find out who was responsible for setting up those guidelines. So there are going to be a lot of questions that we have to answer. In the meantime, what I said to Ric today is let’s not wait for the report retrospectively to reach out immediately to veterans who are currently waiting for appointments, to make sure that they are getting better service. That’s something that we can initiate right now. We don’t have to wait to find out if there was misconduct to dig in and make sure that we’re upping our game in all of our various facilities. I do think it is important not just with respect to Ric Shinseki, but with respect to the VA generally, to say that every single day there are people working in the VA who do outstanding work and put everything they’ve got into making sure that our veterans get the care, benefits and services that they need. And so I do want to close by sending a message out there that there are millions of veterans who are getting really good service from the VA, who are getting really good treatment from the VA. I know because I get letters from veterans sometimes asking me to write letters of commendation or praise to a doctor or a nurse or a facility that couldn’t have given them better treatment. And so this is a big system with a lot of really good people in it who care about our veterans deeply. We have seen the improvements on a whole range of issues like homelessness, like starting to clear the backlog up, like making sure that folks who previously weren’t even eligible for disability because it was a mental health issue or because it was an Agent Orange issue are finally able to get those services. I don’t want us to lose sight of the fact that there are a lot of folks in the VA who are doing a really good job and working really hard at it. That does not, on the other hand, excuse the possibility that, number one, we weren’t just -- we were not doing a good enough job in terms of providing access to folks who need an appointment for chronic conditions. Number two, it never excuses the possibility that somebody was trying to manipulate the data in order to look better or make their facility look better. It is critical to make sure that we have good information in order to make good decisions. I want people on the front lines, if there’s a problem, to tell me or tell Ric Shinseki, or tell whoever is their superior, that this is a problem. Don’t cover up a problem. Do not pretend the problem doesn’t exist. If you can’t get wait times down to 14 days right now, I want you to let folks up the chain know so that we can solve the problem. Do we need more doctors? Do we need a new system in order to make sure that the scheduling and coordination is more effective and more smooth? Is there more follow-up? And that’s the thing that right now most disturbs me about the report -- the possibility that folks intentionally withheld information that would have helped us fix a problem, because there’s not a problem out there that’s not fixable. It can’t always be fixed as quickly as everybody would like, but typically we can chip away at these problems. We’ve seen this with the backlog. We’ve seen it with veterans homelessness. We’ve seen it with the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Initially, there were problems with it. They got fixed and now it’s operating fairly smoothly. So problems can be fixed, but folks have to let the people that they’re reporting to know that there is a problem in order for us to fix it.","Well, thank you for those important questions.

First, on Secretary Shinseki: Yes, he has offered his resignation, and I have accepted it. General Shinseki is a patriot, a decorated veteran who has served this nation with honor for decades. His decision was born out of a profound commitment to our veterans and a belief that a change in leadership would best serve their needs as we move forward to fix these problems.

Now, as for who is to blame if he's not: Look, this isn't about pointing fingers at just one individual. This is about a systemic failure, a breakdown in a large organization that was designed to serve those who sacrificed so much for our freedom. The blame lies with anyone who allowed a culture of manipulation and neglect to fester within the VA system. It's about a lack of accountability at various levels, and we are going to get to the bottom of it. We will hold those accountable who betrayed the trust of our veterans.

And were we caught by surprise? Frankly, the *extent* of these allegations, the deliberate manipulation of wait times, the stories of veterans suffering and even dying while waiting for care – yes, the full scope of that was deeply disturbing and, frankly, a shock to the conscience. We knew there were challenges in an organization of that size, but this level of systemic breakdown and deceit is unacceptable, and we are absolutely committed to fixing it and ensuring it never happens again. Our veterans deserve better."
" What about bonuses for those implicated in mismanagement, Mr. President? ",We’re going to find out. My attitude is --,"Now, that's a question that gets right to the heart of accountability, doesn't it? And frankly, it's one that frustrates hardworking Americans all across this great country.

Let me be absolutely clear: When we're talking about mismanagement, when taxpayer dollars are involved, or when the public trust has been breached, rewarding those implicated with bonuses is simply unacceptable. Period. It's not fair, it's not right, and it sends the absolute wrong message.

We expect — and demand — accountability. We expect stewardship. And we certainly do not believe in rewarding failure, particularly when that failure has consequences for others. My administration has always stood for common sense and fiscal responsibility. And common sense dictates that you reward performance, you reward good governance, and you certainly don't hand out bonuses to those who have let the American people down. That's just not how we do business."
" Mr. President, what changed in your opinion of Secretary Shinseki in the last few days? You had said you had confidence in him -- even him coming in today and saying it was time for him to resign. What made the difference in your mind? ","Ric’s judgment. I think his belief that he would be a distraction from the task at hand, which is to make sure that what’s broken gets fixed so that his fellow veterans are getting the services that they need. I want to reiterate, he is a very good man. I don’t just mean he’s an accomplished man. I don’t just mean that he’s been an outstanding soldier. He’s a good person who’s done exemplary work on our behalf. And under his leadership, we have seen more progress on more fronts at the VA and a bigger investment in the VA than just about any other VA Secretary: Cut veterans’ homelessness by 24 percent; brought in folks who had been exposed to Agent Orange who had been waiting for decades to get the services and benefits that they had earned; making sure that post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury was dealt with in a serious way; making sure we had facilities for our women vets, who all too often weren’t receiving the kind of specialized services that they needed. So he’s been a champion of our veterans. And where there’s problems, he has been ready and willing to get in there and fix them. So with the disability backlog that had shot up as a consequence of the admission of the Agent Orange veterans, as well as making it easier to apply for post-traumatic stress disorder disability claims -- when it spiked, he went at it in a systematic way, and we’ve now cut it by 50 percent over the course of the last year or so. He’s not adverse to admitting where there’s a problem and going after it. But we occupy a -- not just an environment that calls for management fixes, we’ve also got to deal with Congress and you guys. And I think Ric’s judgment that he could not carry out the next stages of reform without being a distraction himself. And so my assessment was, unfortunately, that he was right. I regret that he has to resign under these circumstances, but I also have confidence in Sloan, and I share Ric Shinseki’s assessment that the number-one priority is making sure that problems get fixed so that if there’s a veteran out there who needs help that they’re getting a schedule and they’re able to come in and see a doctor, and that if there are facilities that don’t have enough doctors or do not have enough nurses or do not have enough space, that that information immediately gets in the hands of decision-makers, all the way up to me and all the way to Congress, so that we can get more resources in there to help folks. And that seems to be the biggest problem. I think that’s the thing that offended Secretary Shinseki the most during the course of this process. He described to me the fact that when he was in theater, he might have to order an attack just based on a phone call from some 20- something-year-old corporal, and he’s got to trust that he’s getting good information -- and it’s life or death. And I think he is deeply disappointed in the fact that bad news did not get to him, and that the structures weren’t in place for him to identify this problem quickly and fix it. His priority now is to make sure that happens, and he felt like new leadership would be -- would serve our veterans best. And I agree with him. Phil Mattingly.","Look, when you're the President, you put your trust in good people to carry out vital missions for this country. Secretary Shinseki is a man who has served this nation honorably, a decorated veteran, and I have always had tremendous respect for his commitment and his service to our country.

My confidence, as I've said before, was in his dedication to our veterans. But the facts on the ground, what we've learned in the last few weeks, the profound breakdown in care for the very people we owe so much to—it became clear, it became undeniable, that the system was failing our veterans at an unacceptable level.

When the system fails to this degree, when men and women who put their lives on the line for freedom aren't getting the care they need, leadership has to be accountable. And while I believe Secretary Shinseki has always had the best intentions, the gravity of the situation at the VA, the scale of the systemic failures, meant that a change in leadership was absolutely necessary to restore trust and to fundamentally fix these problems. It's about ensuring our veterans get the care they deserve, no matter what. That's the priority, and that's why we had to move forward as we did."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Based on the audit, at least the early stage audit the Secretary presented to you, is there a sense that there was criminal wrongdoing? And I guess more broadly, how much responsibility do you personally bear, as this being an issue you campaigned on and cared about deeply -- you said cared about deeply during your administration -- now that we’re at this point? ","Well, I will leave it up to the Justice Department to make determinations in terms of whether there’s been criminal wrongdoing. In terms of responsibility, as I’ve said before, this is my administration; I always take responsibility for whatever happens. And this is an area that I have a particular concern with. This predates my presidency. When I was in the Senate, I was on the Veterans Affairs Committee. I heard firsthand veterans who were not getting the kinds of services and benefits that they had earned. And I pledged that if I had the privilege of serving as Commander-in-Chief and President, that we would fix it. The VA is a big organization that has had problems for a very long time -- in some cases, management problems; in some cases, funding problems. And so what we’ve tried to do is to systematically go after the problems that we were aware of and fix them. And where we have seen our veterans not being properly served -- whether it was too many homeless veterans, or a disability claims process that was taking too long -- we would go at it and chip away at it and fix it. When it came to funding, we’ve increased funding for VA services in an unprecedented fashion, because we understood that it’s not enough just to give lip service to our veterans, but not being willing to put our money where our mouth is. And so what I can say confidently is that this has been a priority, it’s been a priority reflected in my budget, and that in terms of managing the VA, where we have seen a problem, where we have been aware of a problem, we have gone after it and fixed it, and have been able to make significant progress. But what is absolutely clear is this one, this issue of scheduling, is one that the reporting systems inside of the VHA did not surface to the level where Ric was aware of it or we were able to see it. This was not something that we were hearing when I was traveling around the country -- the particular issues of schedule. And what we’re going to have to do -- part of the review is going to have to be to see how do we make sure that we get information about systems that aren’t working. I just was talking to Rob Nabors, and he described to me, for example, just in very specific detail, how in some of these facilities you’ve got computer systems for scheduling that date back to the ‘90s; situations in which one scheduler might have to look at four or five different screens to figure out where there’s a slot and where there might be a doctor available; situations in which they’re manually passing requests for an appointment over to somebody else, who’s then inputting them. Right? So you have in many cases old systems, broken- down systems. This is stuff that is eminently fixable, but we’ve got to know about it. And the big concern that I’ve got, and what I’m going to be interested in finding out, is how is it that in a number of these facilities, if, in fact, you have veterans who are waiting too long for an appointment, that that information didn’t surface sooner so that we could go ahead and fix it. One last point I want to make on this: When veterans have gotten access to the system, the health care itself that they are receiving has gotten high marks from our veterans service organizations and the veterans themselves. So I think it’s important to keep in mind that what the review indicates so far, at least, is that there have been great strides made in the actual care provided to veterans. The challenge is getting veterans into the door, particularly for their first appointment, in some cases, and where they don’t have an established relationship with a doctor and they’re not in the system. Part of that is going to be technology. Part of that is management. But as Ric Shinseki himself indicated, there is a need for a change in culture within the VHA, and perhaps the VHA as a whole -- or the VA as a whole that makes sure that bad news gets surfaced quickly so that things can be fixed. And I know that was the attitude of Secretary Shinseki, and that was what he communicated to folks under him but they didn’t execute. And that’s a problem. Christi Parsons, last question.","Thank you for those questions. Let me address them directly.

First, on the matter of criminal wrongdoing based on the Secretary's early-stage audit: an audit, particularly at this initial phase, is designed to identify potential problems, systemic issues, and areas requiring further investigation. It is not a court of law, nor does it deliver a final verdict. What it *does* do is provide a roadmap. We take any indication of potential misconduct very seriously. If this audit—or any subsequent, more thorough investigation—uncovers concrete evidence of criminal wrongdoing, let me be absolutely clear: those responsible will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. There will be no exceptions, and there will be no tolerance for anyone who has betrayed the public trust. We have robust legal processes for a reason, and we will follow them diligently.

Now, regarding my personal responsibility. I campaigned on this issue because I believed in it deeply, and I still do. I spoke about it passionately, and throughout my time in this office, I have dedicated significant energy and resources to it. As President, I am ultimately responsible for the direction of this administration and for ensuring that the policies we enact serve the American people with integrity and effectiveness. When we fall short, when there are failures in implementation, or worse, a breach of trust, I bear that weight. The buck stops with me. My responsibility now, and my unwavering commitment, is to ensure that we understand precisely what went wrong, that we hold every individual accountable who has failed in their duty, and that we put systems in place to prevent such issues from ever happening again. We will not rest until we have restored full confidence in this vital program. That is my promise to the American people."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You said that it was the General’s own judgment that made the decision for you here. If I remember correctly, Secretary Sebelius offered you her resignation after healthcare.gov failed, and you declined to take it. So I wonder if there’s a little bit of scapegoating taking place here. ",Meaning?,"Well, look, I appreciate the question, and I understand why you'd ask it, drawing a parallel like that. But let's be very clear about how our military operates and how decisions are made.

When you're talking about a General in the field, making tactical judgments in a fluid situation – sometimes under fire – that's a very different animal from a Cabinet Secretary dealing with a complex domestic program. We empower our commanders. We trust them with the mission, the resources, and the authority to make the best decisions based on the intelligence they have, on the ground, at that very moment. That's fundamental to military effectiveness. My job as Commander-in-Chief is to set the strategy, give them the tools, and ultimately, stand behind their professional judgment.

Now, the situation with Secretary Sebelius, that was about fixing a serious *programmatic* failure, right here at home. My decision then was about ensuring continuity, getting the problem fixed, and keeping a dedicated person at the helm who was committed to making it right. It was about stability and fixing a very technical challenge.

In the military, when a General makes a judgment call, especially in a critical moment, I trust that call. I stand by our troops, and I stand by our commanders. Ultimately, I take responsibility for the decisions of this administration, and for our strategy. But that doesn't mean I'm going to second-guess a battlefield decision or attribute blame where it doesn't belong. It means understanding the chain of command and the professionalism of the men and women who serve this country. That's not scapegoating; that's leadership and respecting the vital role our military commanders play."
" Meaning, I mean, the dysfunction within the department seems to have been very deep and very widespread. ",Yes.,"That's exactly right. And it's a disgrace, frankly. When you have deep, widespread dysfunction in a department that's supposed to be serving the American people, that's a serious problem. It means things aren't getting done, and frankly, it means trust is eroded. We need to get in there, clean house, and make sure we have the absolute best people, the most competent people, running these vital institutions. No more excuses. It's about accountability and getting results for our country."
" So is lopping off the head of it really the best step to take going forward here? What I’m asking is, is there a political reason for removing him other than going straight to the problem of the bureaucracy? ","Well, the distractions that Ric refers to in part are political. He needs to be -- at this stage, what I want is somebody at the VA who is not spending time outside of solving problems for the veterans. I want somebody who’s spending every minute of every day figuring out have we called every single veteran that’s waiting; have they gotten a schedule; are we fixing the system; what kind of new technology do we need; have we made a realistic assessment of how long the wait times are right now, and how are we going to bring those wait times down in certain facilities where the wait times are too long; if we need more money, how much more money do we need to ask from Congress, and how am I going to make sure Congress delivers on that additional funding. That’s what I want somebody at the VA focused on. Not how are they getting second- guessed, and speculations about their futures, and so forth and so on. And that was what Ric agreed to, as well. With respect to Secretary Sebelius, at the time I thought it would be a distraction to replace somebody at HHS at a time when we were trying to fix that system. And I wanted to just stay focused because I knew that if we bear down on it and we got folks enrolled that it would work. So in each instance, my primary decision is based on, how can I deliver service to the American people, and in this case, how can I deliver for our veterans. And because they are people of integrity, I think in both the cases of Secretary Sebelius, but certainly in the case here of Ric Shinseki, they’ve got the same priority. They’re view is, what is it that is going to best deliver on behalf of folks who, as Ric said this morning, have been let down.","Well, that's a darn good question, and it gets right to the heart of how you actually get things done in this town. You know, sometimes, people think it's just about the mechanics, about the nuts and bolts of the bureaucracy. And sure, a lot of problems *are* about the bureaucracy – about inefficient processes, about rules that don't make sense anymore.

But let me tell you, son, leadership matters. And sometimes, you've got a situation where the leadership itself *is* the problem. Or, maybe they're not the *problem*, but they're not the *solution* either. They're not the right person to drive the change, to light the fire, to get that bureaucracy moving in a new direction. You can't just fix the cogs if the person operating the machine isn't the right fit.

Now, beyond just fixing the plumbing, are there political reasons? You bet your bottom dollar there are. Politics is about trust, it's about momentum, and it's about sending a clear signal.

*   **Signals:** Sometimes, removing someone sends a very strong signal – to the public, to the press, to the rest of the organization, even to our allies and adversaries. It says, 'We're serious about this. We're changing course. We're holding people accountable.' That's a powerful political statement that can shift perceptions overnight.
*   **Optics and Public Confidence:** If the public has lost faith in a particular leader or institution, even if that person isn't solely responsible for the systemic issue, their continued presence can erode confidence. Removing them, even if it feels drastic, can be a necessary step to restore faith and show responsiveness to the concerns of the American people. It shows you're listening, and you're willing to make tough calls.
*   **Team Alignment:** You've got to have a team that's pulling in the same direction. If you've got a leader who's out of step with the overall vision, or who's become an impediment to achieving the agenda you've laid out, then sometimes, for the good of the whole operation, you've got to make that tough call. It's about ensuring your team can execute the mandate you've been given. You need folks who are on board, who understand the mission, and who can deliver.

So, is it *always* the first step? Maybe not. You always want to try to fix things, to coach, to reassign. But when you've got a stubborn problem, or when the message isn't getting through, or when public trust is at stake... sometimes, yes, that decisive action, that change at the top, it's not just about the bureaucracy. It's about leadership, accountability, and the political will to get the job done for the American people. And sometimes, you gotta make those big, bold moves to really shake things up and achieve results."
 I remember at the time that you felt she had so much knowledge about what had gone wrong that you couldn’t afford to lose that. ,Right.,"Well, you hit the nail on the head there. When you're in the Oval Office, or really, any leadership position, you learn pretty quick that you've got to gather all the information you can get your hands on. And sometimes, that means listening real close to the folks who've seen things go sideways.

It's not about blame, not really. It's about understanding the whole picture, the *why* behind the *what*. Because if you don't know why something went wrong, you're bound to repeat it, and that's just not good for the American people. So, yeah, when someone's got that kind of insight, that firsthand knowledge of the pitfalls and the mistakes, you'd be foolish to let that walk out the door. You gotta harness that, learn from it, and make sure we don't stumble down the same path again. That's just common sense."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Just on a technical matter, does the U.S. believe that this passenger jet was targeted, or that those people who shot it down may have been going after a military -- thought they were going after a military aircraft? And more broadly, this incident does seem to escalate the crisis in Ukraine to a level we haven’t seen before. Does that change your calculus in terms of what the U.S. and perhaps Europe should be doing in terms of a response? ","Well, I think it’s too early for us to be able to guess what the intentions of those who might have launched this surface-to-air missile might have had. The investigation is going to be ongoing, and I think what we’ll see is additional information surfacing over the next 24 hours, 72 hours, the next week, the next month. What we know right now, what we have confidence in saying right now is that a surface-to-air missile was fired and that's what brought the jet down. We know -- or we have confidence in saying that that shot was taken within a territory that is controlled by the Russian separatists. But I think it’s very important for us to make sure that we don't get out ahead of the facts. And at this point, in terms of identifying specifically what individual or group of individuals or personnel ordered the strike, how it came about, those are things that I think are still going to be subject to additional information that we’re going to be gathering. And we’re working with the entire international community to make sure that the focus is on getting to the bottom of this thing and being truthful. And my concern is obviously that there’s been a lot of misinformation generated in eastern Ukraine generally. This should snap everybody’s heads to attention and make sure that we don't have time for propaganda, we don't have time for games. We need to know exactly what happened. And everybody needs to make sure that we’re holding accountable those who committed this outrage. With respect to the second question, as you’re aware, before this terrible incident happened we had already ratcheted up sanctions against Russia. And I think the concern not just of Russian officials but of the markets about the impact that this could have on the Russian economy is there for all to see. I made clear to President Putin that our preferred path is to resolve this diplomatically. But that means that he and the Russian government have to make a strategic decision: Are they going to continue to support violent separatists whose intent is to undermine the government of Ukraine? Or are they prepared to work with the government of Ukraine to arrive at a cease-fire and a peace that takes into account the interests of all Ukrainians? There has been some improved language at times over the last month coming from the Kremlin and coming from President Putin, but what we have not seen is an actual transition and different actions that would give us confidence that that's the direction that they want to take. And we will continue to make clear that as Russia engages in efforts that are supporting the separatists, that we have the capacity to increase the costs that we impose on them. And we will do so. Not because we’re interested in hurting Russia for the sake of hurting Russia, but because we believe in standing up for the basic principle that a country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity has to be respected, and it is not the United States or Russia or Germany or any other country that should be deciding what happens in that country.","Thank you for the question. Look, what we have seen unfold, what the world has witnessed over the past day or so, is nothing short of an absolute outrage. And it is, simply put, unacceptable.

Now, as to your first point, our intelligence community, our experts, they are working around the clock right now. We are gathering all the facts, meticulously. And we will get to the bottom of exactly what happened. But let me be absolutely clear: Regardless of what they *thought* they were targeting, whether it was a military aircraft or not – and that, frankly, is an excuse, not a justification – the fact remains that a civilian airliner, carrying innocent men, women, and children, was blown out of the sky. This is an act of horrific violence, and those responsible, and those who enabled them, *will* be held accountable. Make no mistake about that. We are working with our international partners to ensure a thorough, credible investigation.

And to your broader point, yes. This incident, this horrific attack on a civilian aircraft, it absolutely elevates the crisis. It changes the dynamic. It rips away any pretense. When you have innocent lives, from multiple nations, lost in this manner, it is a turning point. It demonstrates the dangerous and escalating nature of the conflict in Ukraine, and it underscores the need for Russia to cease its destabilizing actions in that region immediately.

Does it change our calculus? You bet it does. It must. This is not just about Ukraine anymore; it's about international law, it's about human decency, it's about the safety of global air travel. The United States will be working very closely with our allies in Europe and around the world. We are reviewing all our options, and we will be considering a robust, coordinated response. We will ensure justice for the victims, and we will work to bring stability back to that region. This is a very serious situation, and America will lead."
 At this point do you see any U.S. military role that could be effective? ,"We don't see a U.S. military role beyond what we’ve already been doing in working with our NATO partners and some of the Baltic States, giving them reassurances that we are prepared to do whatever is required to meet our alliance obligations. Steve Holland.","Well, listen, let me tell you something, the United States military is, and always has been, the finest fighting force the world has ever known. And absolutely, I see a vital and effective role for it. You bet I do.

Its effectiveness comes from its unparalleled power, its training, and the incredible dedication of the men and women who wear that uniform. When we deploy our military with clear objectives, with strong leadership, and when we're defending our national interests and standing with our allies, it is absolutely effective.

You look at deterring aggression, maintaining stability in volatile regions, responding to humanitarian crises, protecting vital trade routes, or taking out terrorist threats wherever they may appear – these are all areas where American military might isn't just effective, it's essential.

The key is to use it wisely, with purpose, and with resolve. It's about projecting American strength and ensuring peace through that strength. And when we do that, when we act decisively and with conviction, there's no more effective tool in our nation's arsenal. None."
" Sir, thank you. How much blame for this do you put on President Putin? And will you use this incident now to push the Europeans for stronger action? ","We don't exactly know what happened yet, and I don't want to, as I said before, get out ahead of the facts. But what I do know is, is that we have seen a ticking up of violence in eastern Ukraine that, despite the efforts of the Ukrainian government to abide by a cease-fire and to reach out and agree to negotiations, including with the separatists, that has been rebuffed by these separatists. We know that they are heavily armed and that they are trained. And we know that that’s not an accident. That is happening because of Russian support. So it is not possible for these separatists to function the way they’re functioning, to have the equipment that they have -- set aside what’s happened with respect to the Malaysian Airlines -- a group of separatists can’t shoot down military transport planes or, they claim, shoot down fighter jets without sophisticated equipment and sophisticated training. And that is coming from Russia. So we don’t yet know exactly what happened with respect to the Malaysian Airlines, although obviously we’re beginning to draw some conclusions given the nature of the shot that was fired. There are only certain types of anti-aircraft missiles that can reach up 30,000 feet and shoot down a passenger jet. We have increasing confidence that it came from areas controlled by the separatists. But without having a definitive judgment on those issues yet, what we do know is, is that the violence that’s taking place there is facilitated in part -- in large part -- because of Russian support. And they have the ability to move those separatists in a different direction. If Mr. Putin makes a decision that we are not going to allow heavy armaments and the flow of fighters into Ukraine across the Ukrainian-Russian border, then it will stop. And if it stops, then the separatists will still have the capacity to enter into negotiations and try to arrive at the sort of political accommodations that Mr. Putin himself says he wants to see. He has the most control over that situation, and so far, at least, he has not exercised it.","Well, thank you for the question. Let me be absolutely clear about this: President Putin bears significant, indeed primary, responsibility for this situation. His actions, time and again, demonstrate a blatant disregard for international norms, for the sovereignty of nations, and for the peace and stability that we've all worked so hard to build. This isn't just about an isolated incident; it's part of a disturbing pattern of aggressive behavior that cannot be tolerated by the civilized world.

And yes, absolutely, this incident, like others before it, only underscores the critical need for our allies, particularly in Europe, to stand strong and united. We will absolutely use this moment to reinforce the message that collective security demands collective action. We need to see robust, unequivocal responses, not just in words, but in deeds – whether that's through sanctions, strengthening our defensive posture, or isolating those who seek to undermine democratic principles. America stands ready to lead, but our European partners must meet the challenge with equal resolve. We cannot afford to be anything less than firm."
 Tougher sanctions in Europe -- will you push for them? ,"Well, I think that this certainly will be a wake-up call for Europe and the world that there are consequences to an escalating conflict in eastern Ukraine; that it is not going to be localized, it is not going to be contained. What we’ve seen here is -- just in one country alone, our great allies, the Dutch, 150 or more of their citizens being killed. And that, I think, sadly brings home the degree to which the stakes are high for Europe, not simply for the Ukrainian people, and that we have to be firm in our resolve in making sure that we are supporting Ukraine in its efforts to bring about a just cease-fire and that we can move towards a political solution to this. I’m going to make this the last question. Lisa Lerer, Bloomberg.","Well, look, when it comes to safeguarding our interests and protecting our allies, America has always stood firm. We've got a clear message for those who threaten peace and stability, whether it's in Europe or anywhere else around the globe: Aggression will not be tolerated.

So, when we talk about tougher sanctions in Europe, absolutely. We'll always look at the most effective ways to apply pressure, to hold bad actors accountable, and to make sure there are real consequences for their actions. It's about demonstrating strength, deterring further aggression, and standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our partners who share our commitment to freedom and democracy.

We'll work with our European friends, no doubt about it, to ensure these sanctions are strong, targeted, and hit where they hurt the most, without unduly harming our own economy or the economies of our allies. But make no mistake, America will lead when necessary to ensure the security and prosperity of the free world. We've done it before, and we'll do it again."
" Thanks. I want to ask about the situation in the Middle East. And why do you think Israel should embrace a cease-fire in Gaza when one of its soldiers appears to have been abducted and when Hamas continues to use its network of tunnels to launch attacks? And also, have you seen Israel act at all on your call to do more to protect civilians? ","Well, first of all, I think it's important to note that we have -- and I have -- unequivocally condemned Hamas and the Palestinian factions that were responsible for killing two Israeli soldiers and abducting a third almost minutes after a cease-fire had been announced. And the U.N. has condemned them as well. And I want to make sure that they are listening: If they are serious about trying to resolve this situation, that soldier needs to be unconditionally released as soon as possible. I have been very clear throughout this crisis that Israel has a right to defend itself. No country can tolerate missiles raining down on its cities and people having to rush to bomb shelters every 20 minutes or half hour. No country can or would tolerate tunnels being dug under their land that can be used to launch terrorist attacks. And so, not only have we been supportive of Israel in its right to defend itself, but in very concrete terms -- for example, in support for the Iron Dome program that has intercepted rockets that are firing down on Israeli cities -- we've been trying to cooperate as much as we can to make sure that Israel is able to protect its citizens. Now, at the same time, we've also been clear that innocent civilians in Gaza caught in the crossfire have to weigh on our conscience and we have to do more to protect them. A cease- fire was one way in which we could stop the killing, to step back and to try to resolve some of the underlying issues that have been building up over quite some time. Israel committed to that 72-hour cease-fire, and it was violated. And trying to put that back together is going to be challenging, but we will continue to make those efforts. And let me take this opportunity, by the way, to give Secretary John Kerry credit. He has been persistent. He has worked very hard. He has endured on many occasions really unfair criticism simply to try to get to the point where the killing stops and the underlying issues about Israel’s security but also the concerns of Palestinians in Gaza can be addressed. We're going to keep working towards that. It's going to take some time. I think it's going to be very hard to put a cease-fire back together again if Israelis and the international community can't feel confident that Hamas can follow through on a cease-fire commitment. And it's not particularly relevant whether a particular leader in Hamas ordered this abduction. The point is, is that when they sign onto a cease-fire they’re claiming to speak for all the Palestinian factions. And if they don't have control of them, and just moments after a cease- fire is signed you have Israeli soldiers being killed and captured, then it's hard for the Israelis to feel confident that a cease-fire can actually be honored. I'm in constant consultation with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Our national security team is in constant communication with the Israel military. I want to see everything possible done to make sure that Palestinian civilians are not being killed. And it is heartbreaking to see what’s happening there, and I think many of us recognize the dilemma we have. On the one hand, Israel has a right to defend itself and it's got to be able to get at those rockets and those tunnel networks. On the other hand, because of the incredibly irresponsible actions on the part of Hamas to oftentimes house these rocket launchers right in the middle of civilian neighborhoods, we end up seeing people who had nothing to do with these rockets ending up being hurt. Part of the reason why we've been pushing so hard for a cease-fire is precisely because it's hard to reconcile Israel’s legitimate need to defend itself with our concern with those civilians. And if we can pause the fighting, then it's possible that we may be able to arrive at a formula that spares lives and also ensures Israel’s security. But it's difficult. And I don't think we should pretend otherwise. Bill Plante.","Well, look, the situation in the Middle East, it's always been complex, and it remains deeply troubling, especially what we're seeing in Gaza and Israel right now.

First, let me be clear: Israel has a right to defend its people from terror. The abduction of a soldier, that's an act of terror, plain and simple. And Hamas's continued use of a vast network of tunnels, embedding itself within civilian areas to launch attacks – that's a tactic designed to maximize civilian casualties and make it incredibly difficult for any nation to respond effectively while trying to minimize harm to innocents. It's despicable.

Now, when it comes to a ceasefire, the goal must always be a durable peace, not just a temporary pause that allows Hamas to regroup and continue its aggression. A ceasefire, if it's going to work, needs to address the root causes of the conflict – and that means dismantling the terrorist infrastructure that threatens Israel and stability in the region. And of course, the safe return of *all* hostages, that's paramount. Any discussion of a lasting ceasefire has to include those elements.

Regarding our calls to protect civilians, we've been very clear, and we continue to be clear, with our Israeli allies on the importance of adhering to the laws of armed conflict and doing everything in their power to protect innocent lives. This is a moral imperative, and it's also strategically important for Israel's long-term security. They are a democracy, and they understand that responsibility.

Have we seen them act? Look, this is a war zone, and wars are messy, especially when you have an enemy like Hamas deliberately operating among civilians. But we continue to press them, and we expect them, to take every feasible precaution. We're talking about things like humanitarian corridors, providing warning, and ensuring aid can get to those who desperately need it. We know they face an immense challenge, but the protection of innocent lives must remain a top priority for all parties involved."
" Mr. President, like that cease-fire, you’ve called for diplomatic solutions not only in Israel and Gaza but also in Ukraine, in Iraq, to very little effect so far. Has the United States of America lost its influence in the world? Have you lost yours? ","Look, this is a common theme that folks bring up. Apparently people have forgotten that America, as the most powerful country on Earth, still does not control everything around the world. And so our diplomatic efforts often take time. They often will see progress and then a step backwards. That’s been true in the Middle East. That’s been true in Europe. That’s been true in Asia. That’s the nature of world affairs. It’s not neat, and it’s not smooth. But if you look at, for example, Ukraine, we have made progress in delivering on what we said we would do. We can’t control how Mr. Putin thinks. But what we can do is say to Mr. Putin, if you continue on the path of arming separatists with heavy armaments that the evidence suggests may have resulted in 300 innocent people on a jet dying, and that violates international law and undermines the integrity -- territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, then you’re going to face consequences that will hurt your country. And there was a lot of skepticism about our ability to coordinate with Europeans for a strong series of sanctions. And each time we have done what we said we would do, including this week, when we put in place sanctions that have an impact on key sectors of the Russian economy -- their energy, their defense, their financial systems. It hasn’t resolved the problem yet. I spoke to Mr. Putin this morning, and I indicated to him, just as we will do what we say we do in terms of sanctions, we’ll also do what we say we do in terms of wanting to resolve this issue diplomatically if he takes a different position. If he respects and honors the right of Ukrainians to determine their own destiny, then it’s possible to make sure that Russian interests are addressed that are legitimate, and that Ukrainians are able to make their own decisions, and we can resolve this conflict and end some of the bloodshed. But the point is, though, Bill, that if you look at the 20th century and the early part of this century, there are a lot of conflicts that America doesn’t resolve. That’s always been true. That doesn’t mean we stop trying. And it’s not a measure of American influence on any given day or at any given moment that there are conflicts around the world that are difficult. The conflict in Northern Ireland raged for a very, very long time until finally something broke, where the parties decided that it wasn’t worth killing each other. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been going on even longer than you’ve been reporting. And I don’t think at any point was there a suggestion somehow that America didn’t have influence just because we weren’t able to finalize an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. You will recall that situations like Kosovo and Bosnia raged on for quite some time, and there was a lot more death and bloodshed than there has been so far in the Ukrainian situation before it ultimately did get resolved. And so I recognize with so many different issues popping up around the world, sometimes it may seem as if this is an aberration or it’s unusual. But the truth of the matter is, is that there’s a big world out there, and that as indispensable as we are to try to lead it, there’s still going to be tragedies out there and there are going to be conflicts. And our job is to just make sure that we continue to project what’s right, what’s just, and that we’re building coalitions of like-minded countries and partners in order to advance not only our core security interests but also the interests of the world as a whole.","Well, now, let's just hold on a minute there. ""Lost its influence""? ""Lost yours""? I appreciate the question, but I simply do not accept the premise that the United States of America has lost its standing in the world. Not one bit.

America remains, and will always remain, the indispensable nation. The leading force for peace, for freedom, and for human dignity on this planet. Period.

When we call for a cease-fire in Israel and Gaza, or for diplomatic solutions in Ukraine or Iraq, we're not just speaking into a void. We are speaking from a position of moral authority, backed by our values, our strength, and our unwavering commitment to stability and security. These are deeply complex situations, many with generations of history behind them. There's no magic wand in foreign policy, and anyone who tells you differently isn't being straight with you.

Does diplomacy always yield immediate results? No, it doesn't. Sometimes it's a long, grinding process. Sometimes it's about preventing things from getting far, far worse. It's about building coalitions, delivering humanitarian aid, deterring aggression, and constantly working the phones, making the hard choices, and putting pressure where it needs to be put.

Our influence isn't just about calling for a cease-fire; it's about what we do every single day: leading international efforts, standing with our allies, providing crucial assistance to those fighting for their sovereignty, and pushing for a better, more peaceful future. We've got our boots on the ground, metaphorically speaking, in countless ways, shaping events, protecting our interests, and advancing our values.

So, no, neither the United States of America nor I have lost our influence. We are engaged. We are leading. We are working the problem, and we will continue to do so, because the world needs American leadership, now more than ever. We don't shrink from our responsibilities. That's just not who we are."
 Do you think you could have done more? ,On which one?,"Well, you know, that's a question every single President asks themselves, not just when they leave office, but every day they're in it. You're confronted with immense challenges, both at home and around the world, and you're making decisions with the best information you have at that very moment.

Did we accomplish a great deal? Absolutely. We worked tirelessly, made tough calls, and I believe we moved this country forward in significant ways. We created opportunities, strengthened our standing globally, and tackled some truly persistent problems.

But the presidency is an extraordinary burden, and the problems are always bigger than any one person or any one administration. So, looking back, with the benefit of hindsight, sure, there are always things you might have approached differently, or pushed harder for, or perhaps even understood better at the time. That's just the nature of leadership at that level.

What I can tell you, with absolute certainty, is that I woke up every single day and gave it my absolute best. I put everything I had into that job, for the American people. And I believe we left the country stronger and better for the effort."
 On any of them? Ukraine? ,"Well look, I think, Bill, that the nature of being President is that you’re always asking yourself what more can you do. But with respect to, let’s say, the Israeli- Palestinian issue, this administration invested an enormous amount to try to bring the parties together around a framework for peace and a two-state solution. John Kerry invested an enormous amount of time. In the end, it’s up to the two parties to make a decision. We can lead them to resolve some of the technical issues and to show them a path, but they’ve got to want it. With respect to Ukraine, I think that we have done everything that we can to support the Ukrainian government and to deter Russia from moving further into Ukraine. But short of going to war, there are going to be some constraints in terms of what we can do if President Putin and Russia are ignoring what should be their long-term interests. Right now, what we’ve done is impose sufficient costs on Russia that, objectively speaking, they should -- President Putin should want to resolve this diplomatically, get these sanctions lifted, get their economy growing again, and have good relations with Ukraine. But sometimes people don’t always act rationally, and they don’t always act based on their medium- or long-term interests. That can’t deter us, though. We’ve just got to stay at it. Wendell.","Ukraine. Well, that's a serious situation over there, a profound challenge to the international order we've all worked so hard to build since the end of the Cold War. When you have a sovereign nation, a free people, being invaded, it's not just about their borders; it's about the very principles of self-determination, the rule of law, and whether aggression will be allowed to stand.

America has always stood for freedom, for the right of nations to choose their own path, and for the protection of democracies worldwide. Supporting Ukraine, helping them defend their country and their liberty, that's not just a strategic imperative; it's a moral one. It sends a clear message that might does not make right, and that the free world will unite against those who seek to redraw borders by force.

We must stand with our allies, provide the necessary support, and demonstrate unwavering resolve. It's about protecting innocent lives, upholding foundational principles, and ensuring that stability and peace can eventually prevail in Europe and beyond."
" Mr. President, Republicans point to some of your executive orders as reason, they say, that they can’t trust you to implement legislation that they pass. Even if you don’t buy that argument, do you hold yourself totally blameless in the inability it appears to reach agreement with the Republican-led House? ","Wendell, let’s just take the recent example of immigration. A bipartisan bill passed out of the Senate, co-sponsored by not just Democrats but some very conservative Republicans who recognize that the system currently is broken and if, in fact we put more resources on the border, provide a path in which those undocumented workers who’ve been living here for a long time and may have ties here are coming out of the shadows, paying their taxes, paying a fine, learning English -- if we fix the legal immigration system so it’s more efficient, if we are attracting young people who may have studied here to stay here and create jobs here, that that all is going to be good for the economy, it’s going to reduce the deficit, it might have forestalled some of the problems that we’re seeing now in the Rio Grande Valley with these unaccompanied children. And so we have a bipartisan bill, Wendell, bipartisan agreement supported by everybody from labor to the evangelical community to law enforcement. So the argument isn’t between me and the House Republicans. It’s between the House Republicans and Senate Republicans, and House Republicans and the business community, and House Republicans and the evangelical community. I’m just one of the people they seem to disagree with on this issue. So that’s on the comprehensive bill. So now we have a short-term crisis with respect to the Rio Grande Valley. They say we need more resources, we need tougher border security in this area where these unaccompanied children are showing up. We agree. So we put forward a supplemental to give us the additional resources and funding to do exactly what they say we should be doing, and they can’t pass the bill. They can’t even pass their own version of the bill. So that’s not a disagreement between me and the House Republicans; that’s a disagreement between the House Republicans and the House Republicans. The point is that on a range of these issues, whether it’s tax reform, whether it’s reducing the deficit, whether it’s rebuilding our infrastructure, we have consistently put forward proposals that in previous years and previous administrations would not have been considered radical or left wing; they would have been considered pretty sensible, mainstream approaches to solving problems. I include under that, by the way, the Affordable Care Act. That’s a whole other conversation. And in circumstances where even basic, common-sense, plain, vanilla legislation can’t pass because House Republicans consider it somehow a compromise of their principles, or giving Obama a victory, then we’ve got to take action. Otherwise, we’re not going to be making progress on the things that the American people care about.","Well, look, the presidency is a tough job, and sometimes you've got to use the tools available to you to get things done for the American people. My executive orders are always issued with the intention of addressing pressing issues where Congress has either failed to act, or where I believe further clarification is needed to implement existing law effectively. These are not actions taken lightly, but with a deep sense of responsibility to the nation.

Now, as for trust... I've always been willing to sit down, to negotiate, to find common ground. I believe in the legislative process, and my door is always open to Speaker [X] and the leadership in the House.

Do I hold myself *totally* blameless in the inability to reach agreement? In Washington, D.C., when there's a breakdown in communication, it's rarely just one side's fault. Governing is a two-way street. The House has its own challenges, its own factions, its own priorities, and sometimes, political posturing takes precedence over getting meaningful work done for the country. And that's a hurdle we all have to contend with.

What I can tell you is this: I come to the table ready to make deals. I believe in finding solutions that benefit all Americans, not just one party or another. And I will continue to extend an olive branch, to work tirelessly to bridge divides, because that's what the American people expect from their leaders. We've got too many important challenges facing us to be stuck in gridlock."
 On the border supplemental -- can you act alone? ,"Well, I’m going to have to act alone because we don’t have enough resources. We’ve already been very clear -- we’ve run out of money. And we are going to have to reallocate resources in order to just make sure that some of the basic functions that have to take place down there -- whether it’s making sure that these children are properly housed, or making sure we’ve got enough immigration judges to process their cases -- that those things get done. We’re going to have to reallocate some resources. But the broader point, Wendell, is that if, in fact, House Republicans are concerned about me acting independently of Congress -- despite the fact that I’ve taken fewer executive actions than my Republican predecessor or my Democratic predecessor before that, or the Republican predecessor before that -- then the easiest way to solve it is passing legislation. Get things done. On the supplemental, we agreed on 80 percent of the issues. There were 20 percent of the issues that perhaps there were disagreements between Democrats and Republicans. As I said to one Republican colleague who was down here that I was briefing about some national security issues, why wouldn’t we just go ahead and pass the 80 percent that we agree on and we’ll try to work to resolve the differences on the other 20 percent? Why wouldn’t we do that? And he didn't really have a good answer for it. So there’s no doubt that I can always do better on everything, including making additional calls to Speaker Boehner, and having more conversations with some of the House Republican leadership. But in the end, the challenge I have right now is that they are not able to act even on what they say their priorities are, and they're not able to work and compromise even with Senate Republicans on certain issues. And they consider what have been traditionally Republican-supported initiatives, they consider those as somehow a betrayal of the cause. Take the example of the Export-Import Bank. This is an interesting thing that's happened. This is a program in which we help to provide financing to sell American goods and products around the world. Every country does this. It’s traditionally been championed by Republicans. For some reason, right now the House Republicans have decided that we shouldn’t do this -- which means that when American companies go overseas and they're trying to close a sale on selling Boeing planes, for example, or a GE turbine, or some other American product, that has all kinds of subcontractors behind it and is creating all kinds of jobs, and all sorts of small businesses depend on that sale, and that American company is going up against a German company or a Chinese company, and the Chinese and the German company are providing financing and the American company isn’t, we may lose that sale. When did that become something that Republicans opposed? It would be like me having a car dealership for Ford, and the Toyota dealership offers somebody financing and I don't. We will lose business and we’ll lose jobs if we don’t pass it. So there’s some big issues where I understand why we have differences. On taxes, Republicans want to maintain some corporate loopholes I think need to be closed because I think that we should be giving tax breaks to families that are struggling with child care or trying to save for a college education. On health care, obviously their view is, is that we should not be helping folks get health care, even though it’s through the private marketplace. My view is, is that in a country as wealthy as ours, we can afford to make sure that everybody has access to affordable care. Those are legitimate policy arguments. But getting our ambassadors confirmed? These are career diplomats, not political types. Making sure that we pass legislation to strengthen our borders and put more folks down there? Those shouldn’t be controversial. And I think you’d be hard-pressed to find an example of where I wouldn’t welcome some reasonable efforts to actually get a bill passed out of Congress that I could sign. Last question, Michelle Kosinski.","Look, the border, it's a catastrophe. A complete, unmitigated disaster, the likes of which nobody has ever seen. We have people pouring in, drugs pouring in, crime. It's a tremendous problem.

And can I act alone? Let me tell you, a president, a *strong* president, has tremendous powers. Tremendous. When Congress fails to do its job, which, frankly, they often do, especially on this issue, you have to be able to act. You have to. We built parts of the Wall, we took action. We did things that were tremendous, that were working, and then they stopped it.

Now, ideally, you want them to come to the table, you want them to be sensible, you want them to pass a supplemental that actually secures the border, that isn't just a giveaway. But if they can't, if they won't, if they're playing politics with our national security, then believe me, we have options. And we will use every single one of them to protect our country. We have to. It's a matter of national survival. We will get it done."
" You made the point that in certain difficult conflicts in the past, both sides had to reach a point where they were tired of the bloodshed. Do you think that we are actually far from that point right now? And is it realistic to try to broker a cease-fire right now when there are still tunnel operations allowed to continue? Is that going to cause a change of approach from this point forward? ","Well, keep in mind that the cease-fire that had been agreed to would have given Israel the capability to continue to dismantle these tunnel networks, but the Israelis can dismantle these tunnel networks without going into major population centers in Gaza. So I think the Israelis are entirely right that these tunnel networks need to be dismantled. There is a way of doing that while still reducing the bloodshed. You are right that in past conflicts, sometimes people have to feel deeply the costs. Anybody who has been watching some of these images I’d like to think should recognize the costs. You have children who are getting killed. You have women, defenseless, who are getting killed. You have Israelis whose lives are disrupted constantly and living in fear. And those are costs that are avoidable if we’re able to get a cease-fire that preserves Israel’s ability to defend itself and gives it the capacity to have an assurance that they’re not going to be constantly threatened by rocket fire in the future, and, conversely, an agreement that recognizes the Palestinian need to be able to make a living and the average Palestinian’s capacity to live a decent life. But it’s hard. It’s going to be hard to get there. I think that there’s a lot of anger and there’s a lot of despair, and that’s a volatile mix. But we have to keep trying. And it is -- Bill asked earlier about American leadership. Part of the reason why America remains indispensable, part of the essential ingredient in American leadership is that we’re willing to plunge in and try, where other countries don’t bother trying. I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that in all these crises that have been mentioned, there may be some tangential risks to the United States. In some cases, as in Iraq and ISIS, those are dangers that have to be addressed right now, and we have to take them very seriously. But for the most part, these are not -- the rockets aren’t being fired into the United States. The reason we are concerned is because we recognize we’ve got some special responsibilities. We have to have some humility about what we can and can’t accomplish. We have to recognize that our resources are finite, and we’re coming out of a decade of war and our military has been stretched very hard, as has our budget. Nevertheless, we try. We go in there and we make an effort. And when I see John Kerry going out there and trying to broker a cease-fire, we should all be supporting him. There shouldn’t be a bunch of complaints and second-guessing about, well, it hasn’t happened yet, or nitpicking before he’s had a chance to complete his efforts. Because, I tell you what, there isn’t any other country that’s going in there and making those efforts. And more often than not, as a consequence of our involvement, we get better outcomes -- not perfect outcomes, not immediate outcomes, but we get better outcomes. And that’s going to be true with respect to the Middle East. That’s going to be true with respect to Ukraine. That’s going to be certainly true with respect to Iraq. And I think it’s useful for me to end by just reminding folks that, in my first term, if I had a press conference like this, typically, everybody would want to ask about the economy and how come jobs weren’t being created, and how come the housing market is still bad, and why isn’t it working. Well, you know what, what we did worked. And the economy is better. And when I say that we’ve just had six months of more than 200,000 jobs that hasn’t happened in 17 years that shows you the power of persistence. It shows you that if you stay at it, eventually we make some progress. All right? 0","Well, that's a powerful point you're making, and it's a truth as old as conflict itself – eventually, folks on all sides get *tired* of the bloodshed. They get tired of burying their loved ones, tired of the fear, tired of the uncertainty.

Are we far from that point right now in some of these difficult conflicts? Son, it sure looks like it, doesn't it? When you've got people convinced they're fighting for their very survival, and others who believe they're rooting out an existential threat – a truly dangerous, fanatical enemy – that ""tired"" feeling can be a long time coming. There's a whole lot of deeply held anger, historical grievance, and sheer terror driving these situations.

Now, as for brokering a cease-fire when there are still tunnel operations, still the intent to launch attacks, still the hiding of weapons... Look, a cease-fire isn't just a pause in the fighting. It's got to be a step towards a more enduring peace, towards security. If one side is using that pause simply to rearm, to regroup, to continue hostile operations from underground, then it's not a cease-fire; it's a dangerous deception. It’s an opportunity for them to gather strength and continue the very actions that necessitate the conflict in the first place.

Is it realistic? You can't ask a nation to stand down and expose its citizens to continued danger. A cease-fire has to have genuine, verifiable conditions that ensure the cessation of aggression, not just above ground, but below it too.

Will this cause a change of approach? Good leaders, strong leaders, are always evaluating. They have to. The battlefield changes, the political landscape shifts. You always gotta be thinking about how best to protect your people and achieve your strategic objectives. But the fundamental principles – the need to confront terror, to protect innocent lives, and to work towards a lasting peace that offers security to *all* – those don't change. What might change are the *tactics*, the diplomatic efforts, the pressure we apply. We're always looking for that pathway to stability, but it's got to be a pathway based on security and justice, not on allowing terror to fester in the shadows. That's just not an option for any responsible nation."
 What about John Brennan? Question: The Africa summit -- Ebola? ,I thought that you guys were going to ask me how I was going to spend my birthday. What happened to the happy birthday thing? Statement: Happy birthday.,"Alright, let's talk about it. John Brennan served his time in the intelligence community. You know, a serious business. But when you bring up the Africa Summit and Ebola, now that's a matter of grave importance, and that's where our focus needs to be.

Ebola, folks, that's a clear and present danger. Not just to Africa, but to the world, and frankly, we have to protect our own citizens here at home. When I was in office, we always understood that these kinds of global health crises don't respect borders. They demand American leadership, American ingenuity, and American resources.

An Africa Summit dedicated to tackling something like Ebola? That's essential. We need to be working with our partners on the ground, providing aid, sharing our medical expertise, and making sure we're doing everything humanly possible to contain these outbreaks at their source. It's about humanitarian duty, yes, but it's also about our national security. We can't afford to let these kinds of diseases spread unchecked. America has always risen to the challenge, and when it comes to global health, we must continue to lead from the front."
 What about John Brennan? Question: Africa summit? ,I will address two points. I’ll address --,"Well now, John Brennan... he's a fella who's been around Washington for a long time, done his service in intelligence, served President Obama, of course. Folks have different ways of lookin' at things, different philosophies, but he was in a tough job, and he dedicated himself to it. You know, you got to trust the people who are in those positions, even if you don't always agree on every single policy decision.

Now, an Africa summit, that's important. Africa is a continent of great potential, great people. We put a lot of focus on Africa during my time in office, particularly with PEPFAR – the AIDS program. That was about savin' lives, showin' American compassion, and buildin' strong partnerships. Summits are good, they bring leaders together, but the real work, the important work, happens when you follow through, when you deliver on your promises, when you help folks on the ground. It's about empowerin' 'em, about makin' a real difference. That's what America should always be about, and that's why Africa deserves our attention."
 And Flight 17? ,"Hold on, guys. Come on. There’s just --","Flight 17. A terrible tragedy. A brutal, indefensible act that took the lives of 298 innocent people – men, women, and children – from so many nations.

Let me be clear: The downing of that civilian airliner was an outrage, a grotesque violation of international law. The intelligence was clear, the international investigations have been conclusive: a Russian-made missile, launched by Russian-backed separatists, was responsible.

We mourned with the families, we stood with our allies, and we continue to demand justice. There must be accountability for those who committed this crime, and for those who enabled it. We cannot, and we will not, allow such acts of terrorism to go unpunished. The world must stand firm against those who would commit such atrocities."
 And Africa. ,"You're not that pent up. I’ve been giving you questions lately. On Brennan and the CIA, the RDI report has been transmitted, the declassified version that will be released at the pleasure of the Senate committee. I have full confidence in John Brennan. I think he has acknowledged and directly apologized to Senator Feinstein that CIA personnel did not properly handle an investigation as to how certain documents that were not authorized to be released to the Senate staff got somehow into the hands of the Senate staff. And it’s clear from the IG report that some very poor judgment was shown in terms of how that was handled. Keep in mind, though, that John Brennan was the person who called for the IG report, and he’s already stood up a task force to make sure that lessons are learned and mistakes are resolved. With respect to the larger point of the RDI report itself, even before I came into office I was very clear that in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 we did some things that were wrong. We did a whole lot of things that were right, but we tortured some folks. We did some things that were contrary to our values. I understand why it happened. I think it’s important when we look back to recall how afraid people were after the Twin Towers fell and the Pentagon had been hit and the plane in Pennsylvania had fallen, and people did not know whether more attacks were imminent, and there was enormous pressure on our law enforcement and our national security teams to try 1 to deal with this. And it’s important for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect about the tough job that those folks had. And a lot of those folks were working hard under enormous pressure and are real patriots. But having said all that, we did some things that were wrong. And that's what that report reflects. And that's the reason why, after I took office, one of the first things I did was to ban some of the extraordinary interrogation techniques that are the subject of that report. And my hope is, is that this report reminds us once again that the character of our country has to be measured in part not by what we do when things are easy, but what we do when things are hard. And when we engaged in some of these enhanced interrogation techniques, techniques that I believe and I think any fair-minded person would believe were torture, we crossed a line. And that needs to be -- that needs to be understood and accepted. And we have to, as a country, take responsibility for that so that, hopefully, we don't do it again in the future.","And Africa. A continent of incredible potential, of vibrant cultures, facing its share of challenges. But I tell you, America has always stood with the people of Africa – fighting disease, promoting democracy, encouraging economic growth. We believe in their future, and we'll continue to work with our partners there, because when Africa thrives, the world benefits. Simple as that."
 Mr. President -- ,"Now, I gave you a question. Statement: All right.","Well, thank you. Good to hear from you. What's on your mind today? Let's get right to it."
 The summit -- the U.S.-Africa -- ,"We’ve got a U.S.-Africa Summit coming up next week. It is going to be an unprecedented gathering of African leaders. The importance of this for America needs to be understood. Africa is one of the fastest-growing continents in the world. You’ve got six of the 10 fastest-growing economies in Africa. You have all sorts of other countries like China and Brazil and India deeply interested in working with Africa -- not to extract natural resources alone, which traditionally has been the relationship between Africa and the rest of the world -- but now because Africa is growing and you’ve got thriving markets and you’ve got entrepreneurs and extraordinary talent among the people there. And Africa also happens to be one of the continents where America is most popular and people feel a real affinity for our way of life. And we’ve made enormous progress over the last several years in not just providing traditional aid to Africa, helping countries that are suffering from malnutrition or helping countries that are suffering from AIDS, but rather partnering and thinking about how can we trade more and how can we do business together. And that’s the kind of relationship that Africa is looking for. And I’ve had conversations over the last several months with U.S. businesses -- some of the biggest U.S. businesses in the world -- and they say, Africa, that’s one of our top priorities; we want to do business with those folks, and we think that we can create U.S. jobs and send U.S. exports to Africa. 2 But we’ve got to be engaged, and so this gives us a chance to do that. It also gives us a chance to talk to Africa about security issues -- because, as we’ve seen, terrorist networks try to find places where governance is weak and security structures are weak. And if we want to keep ourselves safe over the long term, then one of the things that we can do is make sure that we are partnering with some countries that really have pretty effective security forces and have been deploying themselves in peacekeeping and conflict resolution efforts in Africa. And that, ultimately, can save us and our troops and our military a lot of money if we’ve got strong partners who are able to deal with conflicts in these regions. So it’s going to be a terrific conference. I won’t lie to you, traffic will be bad here in Washington. I know that everybody has been warned about that, but we are really looking forward to this and I think it’s going to be a great success. Now, the last thing I’m going to say about this, because I know that it’s been on people’s minds, is the issue of Ebola. This is something that we take very seriously. As soon as there’s an outbreak anywhere in the world of any disease that could have significant effects, the CDC is in communication with the World Health Organization and other multilateral agencies to try to make sure that we’ve got an appropriate response. This has been a more aggressive Ebola outbreak than we’ve seen in the past. But keep in mind that it is still affecting parts of three countries, and we’ve got some 50 countries represented at this summit. We are doing two things with respect to the summit itself. We’re taking the appropriate precautions. Folks who are coming from these countries that have even a marginal risk or an infinitesimal risk of having been exposed in some fashion, we’re making sure we’re doing screening on that end -- as they leave the country. We’ll do additional screening when they’re here. We feel confident that the procedures that we’ve put in place are appropriate. More broadly, the CDC and our various health agencies are going to be working very intently with the World Health Organization and some of our partner countries to make sure that we can surge some resources down there and organization to these countries that are pretty poor and don’t have a strong public health infrastructure so that we can start containing the problem. Keep in mind that Ebola is not something that is easily transmitted. That’s why, generally, outbreaks dissipate. But the key is identifying, quarantining, isolating those who contract it and making sure that practices are in place that avoid transmission. And it can be done, but it’s got to be done in an organized, systematic way, and that means that we’re going to have to help these countries accomplish that. All right? Okay.","...the U.S.-Africa **Summit is a vital opportunity to strengthen our partnerships, unlock economic potential, and ensure a more secure and prosperous future for both our continents.** We're here to work together, for the good of all our people. That's what America does best."
 Happy birthday. Question: What about John Brennan? Question: Africa summit? ,I will address two points. I’ll address -- Question: And Flight 17?,"Well, thank you kindly for the birthday wish! That's mighty thoughtful of you.

Now, on to your questions...

John Brennan... he served as Director of the CIA, an important job, a tough job. You know, I've always believed that the men and women of our intelligence community, they work tirelessly to keep our nation safe. They deserve our respect, regardless of who's in charge. It's vital that intelligence remains clear-eyed, focused on facts, and serves the country, not any particular party. We need good people in those roles, dedicated to the mission, and committed to protecting the American people.

An Africa Summit, that's a good idea. We always saw the continent of Africa as a place of great potential, great people. When I was in office, we made it a priority to work with African nations on health, on development, on fighting AIDS and malaria – programs like PEPFAR, which have saved millions of lives. And we worked on security, too. These summits, they're important for building relationships, fostering trade, and ensuring that America is a good partner. We want to see a prosperous, stable, and free Africa, and our engagement is key to that. It's about showing respect, building partnerships, and helping people realize their potential."
" Good morning. To begin with, I’d like to welcome President Obama to Estonia. It is a genuine pleasure and an honor to receive you right before the NATO Summit. Your visit sends a strong message. We are grateful to the United States and to you personally for your leadership, your commitment, and your support to Estonia. To begin with, I also want to say that we are appalled by the latest news from Iraq. We condemn these barbaric acts. We see ISIS as a serious threat to all of us, and stand together with the United States and our allies on this issue. The main issue on our agenda today is security. The question on everyone’s mind is the situation in Ukraine and its wider impact on European security. I just did hear that President Poroshenko and President Putin have agreed on a cease-fire. I just hope it works. But in the general situation, we need to be clear and consistent in the language that we use to describe the situation in Ukraine. As the EU underlined last weekend, this is Russian aggression. The EU and the United States are ready to take further restrictive measures in response to Russia’s behavior. Russia must admit that it is a party to the conflict, and take genuine steps that will lead to a de-escalation of the conflict. We must also continue to support Ukraine by providing the country with the assistance that it needs. When it comes to the security of our region, the United States engagement here runs deep. Estonia is a close and reliable ally to the United States. We take our NATO commitment seriously -- very seriously. We have not sat back and waited for others to take care of our security. Since joining the Alliance, Estonian soldiers have consistently defended the freedom of others -- in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and most recently in the Central African Republic. We dedicate sufficient resources to defense, and are consistently increasing our national defense capacity. We are grateful to the United States for sending troops here and for actively participating in the Baltic air policing mission. Your presence underlies the credibility of NATO’s Article 5. Without a doubt, your bilateral contributions have helped set an example for other NATO Allies. A robust and visible Allied presence here in Estonia is the best way of discouraging any possible aggressors. We look forward to the NATO Summit confirming this. But we face a completely new security situation in Europe, and we are pleased that this is reflected in many of the summit’s documents. We expect the NATO Summit in Wales to adopt the readiness action plan that will guide allied nations for years to come through a set of practical steps and measures of reassurance and deterrence. In addition to our close defense cooperation, I am also pleased that our bilateral relations are strong in many, many other areas, including and especially cyber and energy security. Globally, we are working together to promote our common values -- democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Estonia is a world leader in Internet freedom and in e-governance. We have a liberal economy offering many exciting opportunities for increased trade, cooperation and investment. And this is also one reason why we believe that T-TIP is a crucial, crucial effort on the part of both the European Union and the United States. And let me once again welcome President Obama to Estonia, to Northern Europe, one of Europe’s most prosperous and successful regions. Our countries share common values and interests, and I’m certain that together we can and will contribute to the vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace. Thank you. ","Tere Päevast. To President Ilves -- I want to thank you and the people of Estonia for welcoming me here today. It is a great honor to be in Estonia, especially as we mark our 10th anniversary as NATO Allies. Mr. President, thank you for being such an outstanding partner. I was proud to welcome you to the White House last year, and we’ve spoken since on the situation in Ukraine. Your life reflects the story of your nation -- the son of refugees who returned home to help to chart a path for a free and democratic Estonia. As many of you know, that long journey also took Toomas and his family to America, to New Jersey, where they still remember him as “Tom.” And it was wonderful to meet your daughter today and find out she had gone back to New Jersey as well. He says that he “knew Bruce Springsteen before he had his first record.” So you embody the deep ties between Americans and Estonians. I want to thank you for your friendship. I’ve come here today because Estonia is one of the great success stories among the nations that reclaimed their independence after the Cold War. You’ve built a vibrant democracy and new prosperity, and you’ve become a model for how citizens can interact with their government in the 21st century, something President Ilves has championed. With their digital IDs, Estonians can use their smart phones to get just about anything done online -- from their children’s grades to their health records. I should have called the Estonians when we were setting up our health care website. Most of all, I’m here because Estonia has been a model ally. Estonian forces have served with courage and skill in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we honor our servicemembers who made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan, including nine brave Estonians. As NATO nears the end of our combat mission in three months, I want to thank Estonia for the commitments you have made to help sustain Afghan security forces going forward. As a high-tech leader, Estonia is also playing a leading role in protecting NATO from cyber threats. Estonia contributes its full share -- its full 2 percent of GDP -- to the defense of our Alliance. In other words, Estonia meets its responsibilities. And as we head into the NATO Summit in Wales, Estonia is an example of how every NATO member needs to do its fair share for our collective defense. So I’ve come here, first and foremost, to reaffirm the commitment of the United States to the security of Estonia. As NATO Allies, we have Article 5 duties to our collective defense. That is a commitment that is unbreakable. It is unwavering. It is eternal. And Estonia will never stand alone. As President, I’ve made sure that we are fulfilling that promise. Early in my presidency, I urged our Alliance to update our contingency planning for the defense of this region, and additional NATO forces began rotating through the Baltics, including Estonia, for more training and exercises. In response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine earlier this year, the United States increased our presence further. We have contributed additional aircraft to the Baltic air policing mission -- a mission to which 14 other NATO Allies have also contributed over the past decade. And we’re now continuously rotating additional personnel and aircraft through the Baltics. I look forward to joining Prime Minister Rõivas in thanking our servicemembers later today. On my visit to Warsaw this spring, I announced a new initiative to bolster the American military presence here in Europe, including in the Baltics, and we’re working with Congress to make sure that we deliver. Today, I can announce that this initiative will include additional air force units and aircraft for training exercises here in the Nordic-Baltic region. And we agree with our Estonian allies that an ideal location to host and support these exercises would be Amari Air Base here in Estonia. With the support of Congress and our Estonian friends, I’m confident that we can make this happen. And I look forward to discussing this further when we meet with Presidents Bērziņš and Grybauskaitė this afternoon. As President Ilves indicated, we spend a great deal of time on Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. I’ll have much more to say about this in my speech today. For now, I just want to commend Estonia -- including President Ilves -- for being such a strong voice both in NATO and the EU on behalf of the Ukrainian people. Estonia has provided assistance as Ukrainians work to strengthen their democratic institutions and reform their economy. And because we’ve stood together, Russia is paying a heavy price for its actions, and NATO is poised to do more to help Ukraine strengthen its forces and defend their country. And more broadly, I want to commend Estonia for being such a strong leader beyond NATO. Whether it’s contributing forces to the EU mission in the Central African Republic or supporting relief efforts for the Syrian people, helping nations like Tunisia in their own transition to democracy or standing up for Internet freedom and human rights, this nation of 1.3 million people, as we say, truly punches above its weight. The world is better for it, and it’s yet another reason why the United States will always be proud to stand with our ally, Estonia. Finally, I want to say that today the prayers of the American people are with the family of a devoted and courageous journalist, Steven Sotloff. Overnight, our government determined that, tragically, Steven was taken from us in a horrific act of violence. We cannot even begin to imagine the agony that everyone who loved Steven is feeling right now, especially his mother, his father and his younger sister. So today, our country grieves with them. Like Jim Foley before him, Steve’s life stood in sharp contrast to those who have murdered him so brutally. They make the absurd claim that they kill in the name of religion, but it was Steven, his friends say, who deeply loved the Islamic world. His killers try to claim that they defend the oppressed, but it was Steven who traveled across the Middle East, risking his life to tell the story of Muslim men and women demanding justice and dignity. Whatever these murderers think they’ll achieve by killing innocent Americans like Steven, they have already failed. They have failed because, like people around the world, Americans are repulsed by their barbarism. We will not be intimidated. Their horrific acts only unite us as a country and stiffen our resolve to take the fight against these terrorists. And those who make the mistake of harming Americans will learn that we will not forget, and that our reach is long and that justice will be served. Mr. President. President","Well, Mr. President, thank you. Thank you for that very warm welcome and for your hospitality. It’s always good to be amongst friends, and Estonia, you are certainly a good friend to the United States of America.

First off, let me say, we're all seeing the news out of Iraq, and it's just plain awful. The terrorists, these barbaric thugs from ISIS, they pose a serious threat, not just to Iraq, not just to the Middle East, but to civilization itself. And let me tell you, America stands ready, and we will stand with our allies to confront this evil. We will not let them intimidate us, and we will not let them threaten our way of life.

Now, on the situation in Ukraine. Mr. President, you spoke plainly, and that's important. This is Russian aggression. And the world needs to be clear about that. We hope this ceasefire holds, but hope isn't a strategy. We need to be firm, we need to be united, and we need to make sure Mr. Putin understands that there are consequences for violating the sovereignty of a free nation. We will continue to work with our European partners to ensure Ukraine gets the assistance it needs, and that Russia understands the price of its actions.

And speaking of partners, Mr. President, Estonia. You are an outstanding ally. You mentioned Article 5, and let me tell you, there's no doubt in my mind, or in the mind of the American people, that our commitment to Article 5 is ironclad. When Estonia, when any NATO ally, is threatened, America will be there. You've earned that trust. You've sent your brave soldiers to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our own. You pay your fair share, you invest in your defense, and you don't wait for others to do the heavy lifting. That's what an ally looks like, and we are proud to have you by our side.

This upcoming NATO Summit in Wales is going to be crucial. We need to make sure NATO is ready for the threats of today and tomorrow. A robust, visible presence here in the Baltics – that's not just a good idea, that's essential for deterrence. And I'm glad to see that reflected in the summit's plans. We need a strong Readiness Action Plan to keep our Alliance agile and strong.

Our bilateral relationship, it goes deep. Cyber security, energy security – these are vital areas, and Estonia is a leader, especially in e-governance and internet freedom. We share those common values, democracy, human rights, the rule of law. That's the foundation of everything we do. And trade, T-TIP, it's about opening markets, creating jobs, and strengthening our economies. It's crucial, absolutely crucial.

Mr. President, Estonia is a success story. A free, prosperous, democratic nation right here in Northern Europe. Together, with partners like you, we can continue to build on that vision of a Europe that is whole, that is free, and that is at peace.

Thank you again for your incredible hospitality. God bless Estonia, and God bless America."
" Well, I thought we could open things up for some questions, I understand two from Estonian journalists and two from President Obama’s entourage. As the host, I’ll give the first opportunity to one of our tough questioners, Aarne Rannamäe. Question: Yes, thank you. Aarne Rannamäe, Estonian Public Broadcasting. I have the same question to both presidents. The partnership between Russia and NATO is not the same, as we all know. Why to keep actually it alive, the agreement signed in 1997 between Russia and NATO? Perhaps it would push or give some new opportunities to our region’s security in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. President Ilves: Well, from our side, first of all, NATO did decide to freeze its relations with Russia several months ago. But on the issue in terms of what is the -- what are the implications of the NATO-Russia Founding Act, I suggest all those who say we can’t do anything because of the NATO-Russia Founding Act read the NATO-Russia Founding Act, which says that these conditions hold -- to quote -- “in the current and foreseeable” future, or “the security environment of the current and foreseeable” future. That was the security environment of 1997, when Boris Yeltsin was President, and there had been no violations of either the U.N. Charter or the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, the 1990 Paris Charter. So I would argue this is an unforeseen and new security environment, and therefore one has to hold on to certain provisions. It does not mean we have to give up the whole act, but certainly when an agreement in certain parts no longer holds, well, then it’s time to make a change. I mean, the NATO-Russia Founding Act has been violated by Russia. We continue to support the vision of that document, but its substance has changed dramatically, and I am confident that all of NATO’s actions are and will be conducted in accordance with its international commitments as an alliance. ","The circumstances clearly have changed. And I think this will be a topic of discussion in Wales. Beyond the issue of that particular document, our top priority has been to make sure that there is no ambiguity when it comes to our Article 5 commitments to our NATO Allies. And as a consequence of the rotations that have been increased, the presence of U.S. troops in the course of those rotations and additional NATO Allies, what we want to send a clear message to everyone is, is that we take those commitments seriously. And I think what’s going to be clear during the course of this summit is that, given the changed landscape, not only do we have to make sure that these rotations are effective and designed towards current threats, but more broadly, NATO has to look at its defense capabilities as a whole and make sure that they are updated and properly resourced. For I think a certain period of time there was a complacency here in Europe about the demands that were required to make sure that NATO was able to function effectively. My former Secretary of Defense I think came here and gave some fairly sharp speeches repeatedly about the need for making certain that every NATO member was doing its fair share. I think Secretary General Rasmussen, during the course of his tenure, continually emphasized the need for us to upgrade our joint capabilities. And obviously what’s happened in Ukraine is tragic, but I do think it gives us an opportunity to look with fresh eyes and understand what it is that's necessary to make sure that our NATO commitments are met. And that's one of the reasons that I’m here in Estonia today. I’m going to call on Ann Compton. Ann is on her farewell tour. Question: Thank you very much, Mr. President. Now that you say a second American has been slain, what is your response? Will airstrikes continue inside Iraq? Might they expand into Syria? Will you have a full strategy now on ISIS which will satisfy those like Prime Minister Cameron, who call it an imminent threat to all the interests? And will it satisfy some of your supporters like Senator Feinstein who fears that on this you may have been too cautious? Thank you.","Well, thank you, Aarne, for that very important question. And I appreciate President Ilves's very insightful remarks – he's absolutely right, the world of 1997 is not the world we live in today. Make no mistake.

When the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed, we held out hope for a new era, an era of cooperation and stability following the Cold War. We believed in the potential for Russia to become a responsible partner in the international community. But, frankly, Russia's actions in recent years – their aggression, their blatant disregard for the sovereignty of their neighbors, their violation of fundamental international principles – these actions have changed the very foundation upon which that agreement rested.

Agreements are meant to be honored. They are built on trust and shared values. When one party consistently violates those terms, when they challenge the security environment so fundamentally, then the relevance and the practical application of such an agreement must be re-evaluated. We cannot allow an outdated document to tie our hands or compromise the security of our vital allies.

NATO is a defensive alliance, plain and simple. It exists to protect its members, to ensure freedom and security for democratic nations. And our commitment to our allies, especially our friends in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, under Article 5, is ironclad. It is not negotiable. We must ensure that NATO has every tool, every flexibility, to uphold that sacred commitment. So, yes, the time has come to look at these things with clear eyes and adapt to the reality of the threats we face."

And that's one of the reasons that I’m here in Estonia today. I’m going to call on Ann Compton. Ann is on her farewell tour.","Well, thank you, Aarne. That's a very important question, and it's on the minds of a lot of folks, especially in your region.

Look, when that NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed back in '97, we were looking at a very different world. We had hopes for a cooperative future with Russia, a Russia that would respect international law and its neighbors. That was a time when we believed we could build bridges, not just maintain them, but build new ones.

But let's be clear: Russia, under its current leadership, has systematically dismantled that foundation. They haven't just bent the rules; they've broken them. Repeatedly. They've violated the very spirit and the letter of that agreement by their actions in Georgia, in Ukraine, and frankly, through their broader aggressive behavior.

So, why keep it on the books? Well, sometimes you keep a document to show who *didn't* uphold their end of the bargain. It's a testament to the fact that NATO, we stood ready to cooperate, to build that security environment. It's Russia that chose a different path, a path of confrontation.

But let me be absolutely clear to our friends in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania: that piece of paper, the NATO-Russia Founding Act, does not, and will not, restrict NATO's ability to defend every inch of its territory and every single one of its allies. Our commitment to Article 5 – that's the bedrock – is ironclad. It means what it says. We will continue to adapt, to strengthen our defense, and to ensure the security of our eastern flank, precisely because the security environment of '97 is no longer the environment we live in today. We honor our commitments, and we expect others to honor theirs. When they don't, we adapt, and we act."
" Thank you very much, Mr. President. Now that you say a second American has been slain, what is your response? Will airstrikes continue inside Iraq? Might they expand into Syria? Will you have a full strategy now on ISIS which will satisfy those like Prime Minister Cameron, who call it an imminent threat to all the interests? And will it satisfy some of your supporters like Senator Feinstein who fears that on this you may have been too cautious? Thank you. ","Well, keep in mind that from the outset, the moment that ISIS went into Mosul, we were very clear that this was a very serious threat not just to Iraq but to the region and to U.S. interests. And so we’ve been putting forward a strategy since that time that was designed to do a number of things. Number one, to make sure that Americans were protected in Iraq, in our embassies, in our consulates. Number two, that we worked with Iraqis to create a functioning government that was inclusive and that could serve as the basis for Iraq to begin to go on the offensive. And the airstrikes that we’ve conducted in support of protecting Americans conducting humanitarian missions and providing space for the Iraqi government to form have borne fruit. We’ve seen that in Sinjar Mountain. We’ve seen it most recently in the town of Amerli, which heroically held out against a siege by ISIL. We’re seeing progress in the formation of an inclusive Sunni-Shia-Kurd central government. And so what we’ve seen is the strategy that we’ve laid out moving effectively. But what I’ve said from the start is, is that this is not going to be a one-week or one-month or six-month proposition. Because of what’s happened in the vacuum of Syria, as well as the battle-hardened elements of ISIS that grew out of al Qaeda in Iraq during the course of the Iraq war, it’s going to take time for us to be able to roll them back. And it is going to take time for us to be able to form the regional coalition that's going to be required so that we can reach out to Sunni tribes in some of the areas that ISIS has occupied, and make sure that we have allies on the ground in combination with the airstrikes that we’ve already conducted. So the bottom line is this: Our objective is clear, and that is to degrade and destroy ISIL so that it’s no longer a threat not just to Iraq but also the region and to the United States. In order for us to accomplish that, the first phase has been to make sure that we’ve got an Iraqi government that's in place and that we are blunting the momentum that ISIL was carrying out. And the airstrikes have done that. But now what we need to do is make sure that we’ve got the regional strategy in place that can support an ongoing effort -- not just in the air but on the ground -- to move that forward. And last week when this question was asked, I was specifically referring to the possibility of the military strategy inside of Syria that might require congressional approval. It is very important from my perspective that when we send our pilots in to do a job, that we know that this is a mission that's going to work, that we’re very clear on what our objectives are, what our targets are; we’ve made the case to Congress and we’ve made the case to the American people; and we’ve got allies behind us so that it’s not just a one-off, but it’s something that over time is going to be effective. And so the bottom line is this, Ann -- it’s not only that we’re going to be bringing to justice those who perpetrated this terrible crime against these two fine young men. More broadly, the United States will continue to lead a regional and international effort against the kind of barbaric and ultimately empty vision that ISIL represents. And that's going to take some time, but we’re going to get it done. I’m very confident of it.","Thank you. This is a moment of profound grief for our nation, and my heart goes out to the family of the American who has been so tragically taken from us. These acts of barbaric savagery only strengthen our resolve. Let me be clear: America will not be intimidated. We will not stand idly by.

Regarding our operations against ISIS: yes, our airstrikes in Iraq are continuing. We are hitting them hard, and we will continue to do so. As for expanding our efforts, I have made it clear that we will do whatever is necessary to protect American lives and American interests wherever they are threatened. We will not be confined by artificial lines on a map when it comes to defending our people.

We are developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy, and let me tell you, it's going to be effective. This isn't just an American fight; this is a global fight against a ruthless enemy that threatens us all. Prime Minister Cameron is absolutely right: ISIS is an imminent threat, and we are working very closely with him and other allies to confront it head-on.

To those who believe we have been too cautious, let me assure you that this administration leads with strength and with purpose. We are building a broad coalition, and we are leaving no stone unturned. Every option is on the table. We will hunt these terrorists down, we will dismantle their network, and we will destroy ISIS. They will have no safe haven, and they will know the full force of American justice. Thank you."
" Did you just say that the strategy is to destroy ISIS, or to simply contain them or push them back? ","Our objective is to make sure that ISIL is not an ongoing threat to the region. And we can accomplish that. It’s going to take some time and it’s going to take some effort. As we’ve seen with al Qaeda, there are always going to be remnants that can cause havoc of any of these networks, in part because of the nature of terrorist activities. You get a few individuals, and they may be able to carry out a terrorist act. But what we can do is to make sure that the kind of systemic and broad-based aggression that we’ve seen out of ISIL that terrorizes primarily Muslims, Shia, Sunni -- terrorizes Kurds, terrorizes not just Iraqis, but people throughout the region, that that is degraded to the point where it is no longer the kind of factor that we’ve seen it being over the last several months.","Look, let me be very clear about this. Very, very clear. We're not talking about simply containing them, or just pushing them back a little. That's not winning. That's not what America does when facing this kind of evil.

Our strategy, my strategy, is to absolutely, totally destroy ISIS. We are going to wipe them off the face of the Earth. We have the greatest military in the history of the world, and they are doing an incredible job. They're going to finish it. Believe me. We're getting it done."
" Argo Ideon. Estonian daily newspaper, Postimees. My question is also for both presidents. Ukraine is facing a difficult time, and the situation on the ground may become even more complicated in the run-up to the parliamentary elections there in October. In your view, what more could be done and should be done to support Ukraine politically, economically, and also from a security point of view? What do you think about the idea of providing Ukrainian armed forces with weapons to counter Russia’s attack in the east of the country more effectively? Thank you. President Ilves: Well, most importantly, Ukraine needs above all continued political support. And from that support comes decisions that involve everything else -- economic aid, humanitarian aid, and also military aid. And from that come also decisions on equipment. In Wales, the NATO-Ukraine committee will gather and will decide how to increase NATO defense cooperation with Ukraine. This is the kind of decision that we in NATO take together. On the humanitarian side, we have doubled our humanitarian and development assistance in looking for what more we can do. We have already brought wounded, seriously wounded Ukrainian soldiers to our top-notch rehabilitation center here and will continue to do so. That is certainly one thing that is -- we know the Ukrainians lack that and we have it at a superbly high level, and also, I should add quickly, that with the assistance with the United States and the Walter Reed Hospital that we have this here. The next couple of months leading up to the parliamentary elections will be very tricky. Russia, I predict, will do everything in its power to undermine the elections. We saw this already in the case of the presidential elections. It will try to destabilize the government in Kyiv, and to keep Ukraine forces from regaining ground in the east. So we should be prepared for a tough several -- or a month, month and a half. The next government, of course, that will be then will have the full legitimacy that comes with the new parliamentary elections -- must show that it is a clear and better alternative to the one that the people of Ukraine ousted half a year ago. And I also see that making sure -- ensuring that the elections are carried out in a free and fair manner will be a topmost priority for us, for the OSCE. And I think one of the issues should be, in fact, the kind of interference that we saw in the presidential elections, that not be allowed or be fully addressed and recognized by the monitoring of the elections. I think that we all -- after especially the presidential elections, we all know what the Russian forces can do to disrupt the democratic process. And I think we should be far better prepared to document all of that when we get to the elections. ","Political support is absolutely vital. And one of our goals at the summit over the next several days is to once again project unity across NATO on behalf of Ukraine’s efforts to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The sanctions that we’ve applied so far have had a real effect on Russia. And I think it’s important for us to continue to impose costs on Russia so long as it is violating basic principles of international law. 0 And so far at least we’ve been able to combine efforts between Europe and the United States and some of our allies around the world, and the results are a Russian economy that is effectively contracting, capital flight putting a burden on the Russian economy that at the moment may be overridden by politics inside of Russia as a consequence of state-run propaganda, but over time will point to the fact that this is a strategy that’s not serving Russia well, in addition to not serving Ukraine, obviously, well. Beyond that, the Ukrainian economy is something that we have been paying a lot of attention to. We helped work with the IMF to ensure that Ukraine had the resources to get through some of the emergency financing issues that they had to deal with, but we’re going to have more work to do. The military efforts that have been required to deal with Russian-financed, Russian-armed, Russian-trained, Russian-supported and often Russian-directed separatists has meant that -- has meant a drain on the Ukrainian economy, not to mention the fact that you have major industrial areas inside of Ukraine that obviously have been impacted by the conflict there. So we’re going to have to make sure that the international community stands behind the Ukrainian economy in the short term, even as we encourage and advise and work with Ukraine to carry out some of the basic reforms that are going to be required in order for them to achieve the kinds of models of success that we’ve seen in Estonia and Poland and other places. And that’s a tough row to hoe. It took a couple of decades for some of the countries who are currently in the EU to achieve the sort of market-based reforms that have led to such great prosperity. Ukraine is not going to be able to do that overnight, but we have to make sure that we are helping build a bridge towards that new future. And if we combine those efforts with a commitment to continuing the NATO-Ukraine military relationship -- they are not a member of NATO, but we have consistently worked with their military in terms of training and support -- then I think that not only will Ukraine feel that in words we are behind them, but they’ll see that in deed we are working with them, as well. Steve Holland of Reuters. 1","Argo, and to our friends at Postimees, thank you for that crucial question. The situation in Ukraine is indeed grave, and President Ilves has rightly outlined many of the challenges and the path forward.

First off, let me concur wholeheartedly with President Ilves: sustained political support is the bedrock. It sends an unequivocal message to the Ukrainian people, and to the world, that we stand with them in their struggle for sovereignty and self-determination. From that political resolve flows everything else.

On the economic front, we must continue to provide robust assistance. Ukraine needs to stabilize its economy, rebuild infrastructure, and ensure its government can provide essential services to its citizens. But let's be clear: this aid must be coupled with strict oversight and a commitment from Kyiv to fight corruption and implement critical reforms. We are investing in Ukraine's future as a free-market democracy, and that investment must be protected and used effectively.

Now, to the security question, and the idea of providing weapons. Let me be absolutely clear on this point: when a sovereign nation is attacked, when its people are defending their homes and their very way of life, they have an inherent right to the means to defend themselves. The idea of providing Ukrainian armed forces with weapons to counter Russia’s attack in the east is not merely an idea; it is a necessity, it is a strategic imperative, and it is the right thing to do. We should equip them with the defensive capabilities they need to repel aggression, to deter further incursions, and to protect their territory. This includes advanced weaponry, intelligence sharing, and comprehensive training. We must empower Ukraine to stand strong. President Ilves correctly points to NATO-Ukraine cooperation, and that is vital, but we must also consider all avenues for direct, timely military assistance.

Regarding the upcoming parliamentary elections, President Ilves’s concerns are well-founded. We've seen Russia's playbook before – destabilization, propaganda, interference. We cannot afford to be naive. The international community, through organizations like the OSCE, must be absolutely vigilant. We must document every single attempt by Russia to undermine the democratic process, and we must call it out immediately and forcefully. The Ukrainian people deserve free and fair elections, untainted by external meddling. The legitimacy of their next government depends on it, and the stability of the entire region rests on Ukraine's ability to choose its own future, free from coercion.

In essence, we need to stand with Ukraine with unwavering political commitment, with smart economic assistance that fosters reform, and critically, with the robust military support—including the necessary defensive weapons—that allows a brave nation to protect itself from aggression. That's what leadership demands."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You said during this election that while your name wasn’t on the ballot, your policies were. And despite the optimism that you’re expressing here, last night was a devastating night for your party. Given that, do you feel any responsibility to recalibrate your agenda for the next two years? And what changes do you need to make in your White House and in your dealings with Republicans in order to address the concerns that voters expressed with your administration? ","Well, as I said in my opening remarks, the American people overwhelmingly believe that this town doesn’t work well and that it is not attentive to their needs. And as President, they, rightly, hold me accountable to do more to make it work properly. I’m the guy who’s elected by everybody, not just from a particular state or a particular district. And they want me to push hard to close some of these divisions, break through some of the gridlock, and get stuff done. So the most important thing I can do is just get stuff done, and help Congress get some things done. In terms of agenda items, though, Julie, if you look, as I just mentioned, to a minimum wage increase, for example, that’s something I talked about a lot during the campaign. Where voters had a chance to vote directly on that agenda item, they voted for it. And so I think it would be hard to suggest that people aren’t supportive of it. We know that the surveys consistently say they want to see that happen. The key is to find areas where the agenda that I’ve put forward, one that I believe will help strengthen the middle class and create more ladders of opportunity into the middle class, and improve our schools, and make college more affordable to more young people, and make sure that we’re growing faster as an economy and we stay competitive -- the key is to make sure that those ideas that I have overlap somewhere with some of the ideas that Republicans have. There’s not going to be perfect overlap. I mean, there are going to be some ideas that I’ve got that I think the evidence backs up would be good for the economy; and Republicans disagree. They’re not going to support those ideas. But I’m going to keep on arguing for them because I think they’re the right thing for the country to do. There are going to be some ideas that they’ve got that they believe will improve the economy or create jobs that, from my perspective, isn’t going to help middle-class families improve their economic situation, so I probably won’t support theirs. But I do think there are going to be areas where we do agree -- on infrastructure, on making sure that we’re boosting American exports. And part of my task then is to reach out to Republicans, make sure that I’m listening to them. I’m looking forward to them putting forward a very specific agenda in terms of what they would like to accomplish. Let’s compare notes in terms of what I’m looking at and what they’re looking at, and let’s get started on those things where we agree. Even if we don’t agree 100 percent, let’s get started on those things where we agree 70, 80, 90 percent. And if we can do that, and build up some trust and improve how processes work in Washington, then I think that’s going to give the American people a little bit more confidence that, in fact, their government is looking after them.","Thank you for that question.

Look, the American people spoke last night, and when the American people speak, we all have to listen. That's the beauty and the power of our democracy. Every election is a chance for voters to send a message, and believe me, we heard it.

Now, I've always said my name might not be on the ballot, but the principles and the direction we're trying to take this country were. And I believe in those core principles – in economic growth that lifts all boats, in providing opportunity for every single American, and in strengthening our standing in a complex world. Those goals remain paramount.

Do I feel responsibility? Absolutely. The buck stops here. My responsibility is to every American, regardless of how they voted. It's to understand their concerns, to dig into the roots of their anxieties, and to find solutions that work for families from every walk of life, in every corner of this nation.

So, recalibration. Does it mean abandoning the values and the essential goals that I believe are vital for our nation's future? No, it means finding smarter ways, more inclusive ways, to achieve them. It means rolling up our sleeves and doing the hard work of governing together.

My door has always been open to members of both parties, and it will remain open. We've got big challenges ahead – challenges like the economy, healthcare, and our national security – that don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican. We need to find common ground. We need to work together. And I am absolutely prepared to do just that.

Here in the White House, we'll be looking closely at how we can strengthen our team, how we can better communicate our vision, and how we can forge stronger partnerships with Congress to deliver results for the American people. Because that's what this is all about: delivering for the people. We may have different approaches, but I believe we share common aspirations for this country. It's time to build on that common ground."
 But is there anything specific that you feel like you and your administration need to change given this disastrous election for your party and the message that voters sent? ,"Julie, I think every single day I’m looking for, how can we do what we need to do better. Whether that is delivering basic services the government provides to the American people; whether that is our capacity to work with Congress so that they’re passing legislation; whether it’s how we communicate with the American people about what our priorities and vision is -- we are constantly asking ourselves questions about how do we make sure that we’re doing a better job. And that’s not going to stop. I think that every election is a moment for reflection, and I think that everybody in this White House is going to look and say, all right, what do we need to do differently. But the principles that we’re fighting for, the things that motivate me every single day and motivate my staff every day -- those things aren’t going to change. There’s going to be a consistent focus on how do we deliver more opportunity to more people in this country; how do we grow the economy faster; how do we put more people back to work. And I maybe have a naïve confidence that if we continue to focus on the American people, and not on our own ambitions or image or various concerns like that, that at the end of the day, when I look back, I’m going to be able to say the American people are better off than they were before I was President. And that’s my most important goal. But the other thing I just want to emphasize is I’m -- I’ve said this before, I want to reiterate it -- if there are ideas that the Republicans have that I have confidence will make things better for ordinary Americans, the fact that the Republicans suggesting it as opposed to a Democrat, that will be irrelevant to me. I want to just see what works. And there are some things like rebuilding our infrastructure or early childhood education that we know works. And I’m hoping that the kind of attitude and approach that Mitch McConnell and John Boehner have already expressed, their desire to get things done, allows us to find some common ground. Jeff Mason.","Well, look, the American people spoke, and they spoke clearly. And when the people speak, you've got to listen. That's the bedrock of our democracy. This wasn't just a tough night for Democrats; it was a wake-up call, and frankly, it's one we needed to hear.

What I hear, clear as a bell, is that people are tired of the gridlock, they're worried about their jobs, they're worried about their kids' futures, and they feel like government isn't always working for them. They want results, not rhetoric. They want to know we're focused on the basics.

So, for this administration, it's about redoubling our efforts on what really matters to working families. We've got to be even more laser-focused on economic opportunity, on making sure the recovery reaches every Main Street, not just Wall Street. That means continuing to push for fiscal discipline, absolutely, balancing the budget and making sure we're responsible with the taxpayers' money.

But it also means we've got to take on those tough issues, head-on. Welfare reform, for example. We've talked about it, but now we've got to deliver, to truly end welfare as we know it, to move people from welfare to work, with dignity. And crime, too. We've got to ensure our communities are safe, our kids can walk to school without fear. And we're going to keep investing in education and technology, because that's how we build a strong future.

We've got to show the American people that we can work together, across the aisle, to get things done. We may have different ideas, but we all want a stronger America. My job, and this administration's job, is to find that common ground and deliver for the people. We're going to adjust, we're going to learn, and we're going to lead. That's what the American people expect, and that's what they deserve."
" Thank you, Mr. President. In 2010, you called the result of the midterm election “a shellacking.” What do you call this? And can you give us an update on your feelings about the immigration executive order in the result -- in the aftermath of this election? Does the election affect your plans to release it? Will it still -- is it likely to come out before the lame duck session is over? And have you reduced its scope to just a couple million people? ","Well, as I said in my opening statement, there’s no doubt that Republicans had a good night. And what we’re going to make sure that we do is to reach out to Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, who are now running both chambers in Congress, and find out what their agenda is. And my hope is, is that they’ve got some specific things they want to do that correspond with some things that we want to get done. What’s most important to the American people right now, the resounding message not just of this election, but basically the last several is: Get stuff done. Don't worry about the next election. Don't worry about party affiliation. Do worry about our concerns. Worry about the fact that I’m a single mom, and at the end of the month it’s really hard for me to pay the bills, in part because I’ve got these huge child care costs. Do worry about the fact that I’m a young person who’s qualified to go to college, but I’m really worried about taking $50,000 a year out in debt and I don't know how I’d pay that back. Do worry about the fact that I’m a construction worker who has been working all my life, and I know that there’s construction work that should be done, but right now, for some reason, projects are stalled. If we're thinking about those folks I think we're, hopefully, going to be able to get some stuff done. In terms of immigration, I have consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would strengthen our borders; would streamline our legal immigration system so that it works better and we're attracting the best and the brightest from around the world; and that we give an opportunity for folks who’ve lived here, in many cases, for a very long time, may have kids who are U.S. citizens, but aren’t properly documented -- give them a chance to pay their back taxes, get in the back of the line, but get through a process that allows them to get legal. The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, passed a good bill. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t exactly what I wanted, but it was a sound, smart, piece of legislation that really would greatly improve not just our immigration system but our economy, and would improve business conditions here in the United States -- and make sure that American-born workers aren’t undercut by workers who are undocumented and aren’t always paid a fair wage and, as a consequence, employers who are breaking the rules are able to undercut folks who are doing the right thing. So we got a bipartisan bill out of the Senate. I asked John Boehner at that point, can we pass this through the House? There’s a majority of votes in the House to get this passed. And Speaker Boehner I think was sincere about wanting to pass it, but had difficulty over the last year trying to get it done. So when he finally told me he wasn’t going to call it up this year, what I indicated to him is I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse, but that whatever executive actions that I take will be replaced and supplanted by action by Congress. You send me a bill that I can sign, and those executive actions go away. That's a commitment I made not just to the American people -- and to businesses and the evangelical community and the law enforcement folks and everybody who’s looked at this issue and thinks that we need immigration reform -- that's a commitment that I also made to John Boehner, that I would act in the absence of action by Congress. So before the end of the year, we're going to take whatever lawful actions that I can take that I believe will improve the functioning of our immigration system that will allow us to surge additional resources to the border, where I think the vast majority of Americans have the deepest concern. And at the same time, I’ll be reaching out to both Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, and other Republican as well as Democratic leaders to find out how it is that they want to proceed. And if they want to get a bill done -- whether it’s during the lame duck or next year -- I'm eager to see what they have to offer. But what I’m not going to do is just wait. I think it’s fair to say that I’ve shown a lot of patience and have tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible, and I’m going to keep on doing so. But in the meantime, let’s figure out what we can do lawfully through executive actions to improve the functioning of the existing system.","Shellacking? Look, I don't know who said that, but that's a very weak word. A very weak word. When *I* win, and we've won so much, believe me, it's a tremendous landslide, an historic victory. That's what we do.

What do I call *this*? I call this a clear message from the American people. They're fed up with the chaos, the incompetence, the open borders. They're tired of being taken advantage of. It's a massive rejection of the failed policies we've been seeing, and it's a powerful endorsement for strength, for common sense, for making America great again. A very, very clear signal.

Now, this executive order nonsense you're talking about... you know, under my administration, we did things differently. We built the Wall, we secured our borders, we stopped the flow. We didn't play games with executive orders that only reward illegal immigration and make our country less safe. That's what the radical left tries to do. They want open borders, they want to let everyone in, no questions asked. It's insane.

My executive orders, they were about securing America, putting American citizens first. We didn't reduce the scope of anything to just a couple million people for some kind of amnesty. We expanded enforcement. We put steel and concrete on the border. We deported criminals. We knew what we were doing.

So, no, you're mixing up your presidents, frankly. We don't do those kinds of executive orders. We do strong, effective executive orders that protect our country and put America first. And we do it with courage, not with 'shellackings.' That's a joke."
 How will you make sure that that executive action has teeth if Republicans try to block it by blocking funding? And can you give us a sense of whether or not you're thinking about -- ,"Jeff, I think if you want to get into the details of it, I suspect that when I announce that executive action, it will be rife with detail. And I’m sure there will be a lot of follow-up questions. Chris Jansing.","Well now, that's a question I hear a lot from folks in Washington. Always talking about blocking this, blocking that. But you know, when you're the President of the United States, your job is to lead, and your job is to get things done for the American people.

An executive action, when it's well-crafted and necessary for the country – and make no mistake, mine always are – it carries the full weight of the Oval Office. Now, about funding. Congress has the power of the purse, absolutely. And some folks over there might try to play games, hold things up, score political points. But that doesn't stop us from moving forward.

First off, we look at what resources we *do* have. The federal government is a big operation. There are always existing appropriations, existing personnel, existing programs that can be re-prioritized, re-directed, and put to work on what's important. We've got smart people in these agencies, and they know how to make every dollar count, especially when they're given a clear directive from the President.

Secondly, we make the case to the American people. When an executive action is clearly in their best interest, when it's about securing our borders, or boosting our economy, or keeping us safe – the people understand that. And when the people speak, Congress tends to listen, sooner or later. Political pressure is a powerful tool, folks.

And finally, we explore every legal avenue. We make sure our actions are on solid constitutional ground, and we stand firm. We might have to get creative, we might have to tighten our belts in some areas to make sure the vital work gets done in others. But a President's responsibility is to act decisively, not to be paralyzed by partisan squabbling. We will find a way to make sure these actions have the impact they're intended to have, for the good of the country. You can count on that.

So, to answer your question: we lead, we prioritize, and we get the job done. That's how executive action gets its teeth, even when some folks in Congress are dragging their heels."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I want to follow up on a couple of things and start with immigration. And are you concerned that if you sign an executive order on immigration before the end of the year it will scuttle whatever chances there may be for there to be some sort of compromise on the issues that you talked about? And I wonder that, given this unhappy electorate, clearly, and they seem to be disappointed with both sides pretty much, why they punished the Democrats more than the Republicans by far. ","Well, as I said, when it comes to the political analysis, that’s your job. But what is also true is I am the President of the United States, and I think, understandably, people are going to ask for greater accountability and more responsibility from me than from anybody else in this town. Appropriately so, and I welcome that. And the commitment that I will make to the American people and the way I’ve tried to conduct myself throughout this presidency is that I’m going to wake up every single day doing my absolute best to deliver for them. And there are areas where we’ve made real progress. I think economically, I can look back and there is no doubt that almost -- on almost every measure, we are better off economically than we were when I took office. But what is also true is there are still a lot of folks out there who are anxious and are hurting and are having trouble making ends meet, or are worried about their children’s future. And it’s my job to give them some confidence that this town can work to respond to some of those worries that folks have. And we haven’t done a good enough job convincing them of that. And I understand that. They’ve been watching Washington over the last two, four years. What they’ve seen is a lot of arguing and a lot of gridlock, but not a lot of concrete actions, at least legislatively, that have made a difference in their lives. And so we’ve got to make sure that we do a better job, and I’m committed to doing that. On immigration, I know that concerns have been expressed that, well, if you do something through executive actions, even if it’s within your own authorities, that that will make it harder to pass immigration reform. I just have to remind everybody I’ve heard that argument now for a couple of years. This is an issue I actually wanted to get done in my first term, and we didn’t see legislative action. And in my second term, I made it my top legislative priority, and we got really good work done by a bipartisan group of senators, but it froze up in the House. And I think that the best way if folks are serious about getting immigration reform done is going ahead and passing a bill and getting it to my desk. And then the executive actions that I take go away. They’re superseded by the law that has passed. And I will engage any member of Congress who’s interested in this in how we can shape legislation that will be a significant improvement over the existing system. But what we can’t do is just keep on waiting. There is a cost to waiting. There’s a cost to our economy. It means that resources are misallocated. When the issue of unaccompanied children cropped up during this summer, there was a lot of folks who perceived this as a major crisis in our immigration system. Now, the fact is, is that those numbers have now come down and they’re approximately where they were a year ago or two years ago or a year before that. But it did identify a real problem in a certain portion of the border where we got to get more resources. But those resources may be misallocated, separating families right now that most of us, most Americans would say probably we’d rather have them just pay their back taxes, pay a fine, learn English, get to the back of the line, but we’ll give you a pathway where you can be legal in this country. So where I’ve got executive authorities to do that, we should get started on that. But I want to emphasize once again, if, in fact, Republican leadership wants to see an immigration bill passed, they now have the capacity to pass it. And hopefully engaging with me and Democrats in both the House and the Senate, it’s a bill that I can sign because it addresses the real concerns that are out there. And the sooner they do it, from my perspective, the better. Jonathan Karl.","Well, thank you for that question. Let's talk about it.

First off, on immigration. Look, I've been clear from day one: we need comprehensive immigration reform. We need to secure our border, we need to enforce our laws, and we need a system that works for our economy and reflects the values of our nation. My preference, always, is for Congress to act. That's how our system is designed to work. But when Congress doesn't act, when the situation demands leadership, a President has a responsibility to do what's necessary within the confines of the law to protect our nation and to address a crisis.

Now, will an executive order scuttle compromise? I don't believe so. What I believe it does is highlight the urgency. It says, 'We can't wait.' My door remains open. My phone line is always available for members of both parties who are serious about finding a lasting legislative solution. But we can't simply stand by and do nothing while the problem grows. Taking action now is not about ending negotiations; it's about demonstrating the seriousness of the issue and ensuring we're doing everything we can to maintain order and security. It should be an *impetus* for Congress to finally come together, not an excuse to walk away.

And on the electorate, that's a fair point. Americans are looking for results. They're looking for common sense. And when they don't see Washington working for them, when they see gridlock and policies that aren't improving their lives, they express their displeasure. I think what you saw, what we all saw, was a clear message that people are concerned about the direction of the country. They're concerned about the economy, about rising costs, about our national security, and about the role of government. And when one side is perceived as being out of step with those concerns, or not delivering on the promises, or perhaps being a bit too heavy-handed, the American people will make their voices heard. They want strong leadership, they want fiscal discipline, and they want Washington to listen to the folks out in the country, not just the folks inside the beltway. They tend to punish whoever they feel isn't listening, and often, that's the party that's perceived to be in charge at the moment. It's a call for accountability, and it's a call for us all to do better."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Mitch McConnell has been the Republican Leader for six years, as long as you’ve been President. But his office tells me that he has only met with you one-on-one once or twice during that entire six-year period. So I’m wondering, as somebody who came to Washington promising to end the hyper-partisanship that was here long before you became President but has gotten worse since you got here, was it a mistake for you to do so little to develop relationships with Republicans in Congress? ","I think that every day I’m asking myself, are there some things I can do better. And I’m going to keep on asking that every single day. The fact is that most of my interactions with members of Congress have been cordial and they’ve been constructive. Oftentimes, though, we just haven’t been able to actually get what’s discussed in a leadership meeting through caucuses in the House and the Senate to deliver a bill. The good news is that now Mitch McConnell and John Boehner are from the same party; I think they can come together and decide what their agenda is. They’ve got sufficient majorities to make real progress on some of these issues. And I’m certainly going to be spending a lot more time with them now because that’s the only way that we’re going to be able to get some stuff done. And I take them at their word that they want to produce. They’re in the majority; they need to present their agenda. I need to put forward my best ideas. I think the American people are going to be able to watch us and they’re paying attention to see whether or not we’re serious about actually compromising and being constructive. And my commitment to them -- and I’ve said this when I spoke to them -- is, is that anywhere where we can find common ground, I’m eager to pursue it.","Look, that's a very interesting question, and frankly, it's not quite as simple as your office might be telling you. Senator McConnell, he's been there a long time, and he's the leader, yes, a very important position. We've worked together on some big things, tremendous things, for the American people, believe me.

Now, as for the 'one-on-one' meetings... We communicate in many ways. You know, sometimes you talk on the phone, sometimes you have other people working on things, sometimes things get done through sheer force of will, which is what I brought to Washington. My focus, always, was on getting the job done, delivering for the country, not just sitting around having tea parties with people who, frankly, might have other agendas or aren't as focused on making America great as I am.

I came to Washington to drain the swamp, to fix problems that nobody else had the guts to fix. And we did! We got the economy roaring, we appointed conservative judges at a pace nobody thought possible, we rebuilt our military. These weren't small things. And we did it despite a lot of opposition, not just from the other side, but from people who should have been with us, who weren't always playing ball.

The hyper-partisanship you're talking about? That's been in Washington forever, it's sick. I tried, nobody tried harder than me, to bring people together for the good of the country. But you have to have partners who are willing to work. Some people, they just want to stop you, they don't want to get things done. So, was it a mistake not to sit around and chit-chat more? No. My job was to produce results, and we produced results like nobody's ever seen. We didn't need to hold hands to make America great again."
 Are you going to have that drink with Mitch McConnell now that you joked about at the White House Correspondents Dinner? ,"You know, actually, I would enjoy having some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell. I don’t know what his preferred drink is, but -- my interactions with Mitch McConnell, he has always been very straightforward with me. To his credit, he has never made a promise that he couldn’t deliver. And he knows the legislative process well. He obviously knows his caucus well -- he has always given me, I think, realistic assessments of what he can get through his caucus and what he can’t. And so I think we can have a productive relationship. Phil Mattingly.","Well, you know, the White House Correspondents' Dinner… it's a night for a little bit of levity, isn't it? We all need a good laugh now and then.

Mitch and I… we’ve had our share of serious conversations over the years, that’s for sure. And look, we don’t always see eye-to-eye on every single thing – nobody does – but we’ve always managed to find a way to work together when it really matters for the American people. That’s what leadership is all about.

As for that drink? Ha! When you’re in this business, you spend a lot of time with folks from all sides of the aisle. Sometimes you break bread, sometimes it's a cup of coffee, and sometimes, well, a stronger beverage might just hit the spot after a long week of negotiations.

The important thing is, whether it's a joke at a dinner or a serious sit-down in the Oval Office, we've got to be able to talk to each other. That's how you get things done for the country. So, you never say never, but the work always comes first. We'll see what the schedule allows!"
" Thank you, Mr. President. Another deadline coming up is your negotiators by November 24th have to figure out if they’re going to reach a deal with Iran on a nuclear area, a nuclear agreement. I’m interested what your current perspective is on how those negotiations are going. Also if it is your feeling that you have the power to implement any type of agreement that's reached without any action from Congress? And then, also I just wanted to quickly touch on the AUMF that you mentioned earlier. Is that going to be more of a codification of the limits that you've put in place for the mission up to this point? Or what should we be looking for on that when you send it to the Hill? Thank you. ","On the AUMF, the leaders are going to be coming here on Friday. It will be an expanded group, not just the four leaders, but a larger group who all have an interest in the issues we're discussing today. And I’m actually going to invite Lloyd Austin, the CENTCOM Commander, to make a presentation about how our fight against ISIL is proceeding and I think to answer questions and assure that Congress is fully briefed on what we're doing there. With respect to the AUMF, we’ve already had conversations with members of both parties in Congress, and the idea is to right-size and update whatever authorization Congress provides to suit the current fight, rather than previous fights. In 2001, after the heartbreaking tragedy of 9/11, we had a very specific set of missions that we had to conduct, and the AUMF was designed to pursue those missions. With respect to Iraq, there was a very specific AUMF. We now have a different type of enemy. The strategy is different. How we partner with Iraq and other Gulf countries and the international coalition -- that has to be structured differently. So it makes sense for us to make sure that the authorization from Congress reflects what we perceive to be not just our strategy over the next two or three months, but our strategy going forward. 0 And it will be a process of listening to members of Congress, as well as us presenting what we think needs to be the set of authorities that we have. And I’m confident we're going to be able to get that done. And that may just be a process of us getting it started now. It may carry over into the next Congress. On Iran, because of the unprecedented sanctions that we put in place that really did have a crippling effect on Iran’s economy, they’ve come to the table and they’ve negotiated seriously around providing assurances that they're not developing a nuclear weapon for the first time. And they have abided by the interim rules. We have been able to freeze their program, in some cases reduce the stockpile of nuclear material that they already had in hand. And the discussions, the negotiations have been constructive. The international community has been unified and cohesive. There haven’t been a lot of cracks in our alliance. Even countries where we have some differences, like Russia, have agreed with us and have worked with us cooperatively in trying to find ways to make sure that we can verify and have confidence going forward that Iran doesn't have the capacity to develop a nuclear weapon that could not only threaten friends of ours like Israel, trigger a nuclear arms race in the region, but could over the long term, potentially threaten us. Whether we can actually get a deal done, we’re going to have to find out over the next three to four weeks. We have presented to them a framework that would allow them to meet their peaceful energy needs. And if, in fact, what their leadership says, that they don’t want to develop a nuclear a weapon -- if that is, in fact, true, then they’ve got an avenue here to provide that assurance to the world community, and in a progressive, step-by-step, verifiable way, allow them to get out from under sanctions so that they can reenter as full-fledged members of the international community. But they have their own politics, and there’s a long tradition of mistrust between the two countries. And there’s a sizeable portion of the political elite that cut its teeth on anti- Americanism and still finds it convenient to blame America for every ill that there is. And whether they can manage to say yes to what clearly would be better for Iran, better for the region, and better for the world, is an open question. We’ll find out over the next several weeks.","Thank you for those important questions.

Regarding Iran, these negotiations are, by their very nature, complex and challenging. We're dealing with a regime that has a history of deception and a clear ambition. My team is working tirelessly to ensure that any potential agreement is robust, verifiable, and genuinely prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Our commitment to non-proliferation remains absolute. This isn't just about a deadline; it's about our national security and the security of our allies in the region. We are pressing hard, but any deal must serve America's interests first and foremost.

As for the authority to implement an agreement without congressional action, the executive branch has a clear constitutional mandate in foreign policy and national security. We will, of course, keep Congress fully informed and look for ways to work together, but the President has the authority to make agreements that serve the vital interests of the United States.

On the AUMF you mentioned earlier, my intention is to provide our military with the necessary legal framework to confront the threats we face today, recognizing that the world has changed since the original authorizations. We need to ensure that our forces have the clarity and the authority to act decisively when required, but also that these authorizations are precisely tailored to the current mission. So, yes, you should expect a proposal that reflects the evolution of the mission and provides both the necessary tools and appropriate limits, ensuring accountability and effectiveness. It's about giving our men and women in uniform the clarity they deserve, while also modernizing the legal basis for our operations."
" Sir, on whether or not you have the power unilaterally to relax sanctions to implement an agreement? ","There are a series of different sanctions. There are multilateral sanctions; there are U.N. sanctions; there are sanctions that have been imposed by us, this administration, unilaterally. And I think it’s different for each of those areas. 1 But I don’t want to put the cart before the horse. What I want to do is see if we, in fact, have a deal. If we do have a deal that I have confidence will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and that we can convince the world and the public will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, then it will be time to engage in Congress. And I think that we’ll be able to make a strong argument to Congress that this is the best way for us to avoid a nuclear Iran; that it will be more effective than any other alternatives we might take, including military action. But that requires it being a good deal. And I’ve said consistently that I’d rather have no deal than a bad deal -- because what we don’t want to do is lift sanctions and provide Iran legitimacy but not have the verifiable mechanisms to make sure that they don’t break out and produce a nuclear weapon. Ed Henry. I missed you guys. I haven't done this in a while.","Well, that's an important question, and it goes right to the heart of a President's responsibilities in foreign policy. Now, let me be clear: the President, as Commander-in-Chief and the chief architect of our nation's foreign affairs, absolutely has significant authority in this realm.

When it comes to sanctions, Congress often grants the President specific powers to impose them, and by extension, to modify or waive them when it serves the national interest. This isn't just about raw power; it's about the essential flexibility required to conduct diplomacy effectively.

You see, if you're trying to forge an agreement, if you're working to de-escalate a situation or achieve a strategic breakthrough, the President needs the ability to make tactical adjustments. Freezing sanctions, or relaxing them in a carefully calibrated way, can be a crucial component of a negotiation. It's about providing an incentive, demonstrating good faith, and creating space for a resolution that benefits American security and prosperity.

Now, of course, Congress has a vital role in our system of checks and balances, and they oversee these matters closely. But when an agreement is on the table, an agreement designed to protect American interests and advance peace, the executive branch must have the necessary tools to implement it. That unilateral power, within the framework of existing law and in service of our national security objectives, is indeed a critical aspect of presidential authority."
" I know, I’ve missed you. Thank you, Mr. President. I haven't heard you say a specific thing during this news conference that you would do differently. You’ve been asked it a few different ways. I understand you’re going to reach out, but you’ve talked about doing that before. It’s almost like you’re doubling down on the same policies and approach you’ve had for six years. So my question is, why not pull a page from the Clinton playbook and admit you have to make a much more dramatic shift in course for these last two years? And on ISIS, there was pretty dramatic setback in the last few days with it appearing that the Syrian rebels have been routed. There are some Gitmo detainees who have rejoined the battlefield, helping ISIS and other terror groups, is what the reports are suggesting. So my question is, are we winning? ","Well, I think it’s too early to say whether we are winning, because as I said at the outset of the ISIL campaign, this is going to be a long-term plan to solidify the Iraqi government, to solidify their security forces, to make sure that in addition to air cover that they have the capacity to run a ground game that pushes ISIL back from some of the territories that they had taken, that we have a strong international coalition that we’ve now built, but that they are on the ground providing the training, providing the equipment, providing the supplies that are necessary for Iraqis to fight on behalf of their territory. And what I also said was that in Syria that’s been complicated and that’s not going to be solved any time soon. Our focus in Syria is not to solve the entire Syria situation, but rather to isolate the areas in which ISIL can operate. And there is no doubt that because of the extraordinary bravery of our men and women in uniform, and the precision of our pilots and the strikes that have taken place, that ISIL is in a more vulnerable position and it is more difficult for them to maneuver than it was previously. 2 Now, there’s a specific issue about trying to get a moderate opposition in Syria that can serve as a partner with us on the ground. That’s always been the hardest piece of business to get done. There are a lot of opposition groups in Syria along a spectrum from radical jihadists who are our enemies to folks who believe in inclusive democracy, and everything in between. They fight among each other. They are fighting the regime. And what we’re trying to do is to find a core group that we can work with that we have confidence in, that we’ve vetted, that can help in regaining territory from ISIL, and then ultimately serve as a responsible party to sit at the table in eventual political negotiations that are probably some ways off in the future. That’s always been difficult. As you know, one of the debates has consistently been, should the Obama administration provide more support to the opposition? Could that have averted some of the problems that are taking place in Syria? And as I’ve said before, part of the challenge is it’s a messy situation. This is not a situation where we have one single unified, broad-based, effective, reliable --","Well, thank you, I appreciate that. Always good to hear from you.

Look, I understand the desire for dramatic shifts, for big, bold pronouncements. And yes, history is full of moments where leaders have had to adapt, to pivot. But let me be clear about this administration: we are constantly evaluating, constantly adapting, and constantly improving our approach based on the facts on the ground and what works for the American people.

You say ""doubling down"" – I say *staying the course* on principles that are sound, while *refining* tactics where needed. We are not married to any one policy if it isn't delivering, but we are also not going to abandon a strategy that is fundamentally sound just for the sake of appearances. My job is to protect this nation, to grow our economy, and to secure our future. And we are making progress on all fronts. We're going to keep listening, we're going to keep adjusting, and we're going to keep leading. That's not doubling down on old mistakes; that's responsible leadership.

Now, on ISIS and the challenges we face. Make no mistake: the fight against radical Islamic terror is a generational struggle. It's complex, it's dangerous, and no one ever said it would be easy. We have seen setbacks, absolutely. The situation in Syria is fluid, and these terrorists will exploit any opening they can find. And yes, the reports of some Gitmo detainees rejoining the fight are concerning, and we are tracking those individuals and their networks closely with our intelligence agencies and our partners around the world.

But let me tell you this: we are systematically degrading ISIS's capabilities. We are taking out their leadership. We are choking off their financing. We are disrupting their networks. And we are working with a strong international coalition to push them back, to reclaim territory, and to stop their hateful ideology from spreading.

Are we winning? Yes, we are winning. Because America never gives up. We are relentless. We have the finest military in the history of the world, and they are doing incredible work every single day. We will dismantle ISIS. We will defeat them. It will take time, it will require patience, and it will demand our continued resolve. But we will prevail. This nation understands the stakes, and we will not rest until the job is done."
 -- the idea that maybe we have to have -- ,"Let me answer the question, Ed. And so what we are going to continue to test is, can we get a more stable, effective, cohesive, moderate opposition? But that’s not the sole measure of whether we are “winning” or not. Remember, our first focus, Ed, here is to drive ISIL out of Iraq. And what we’re doing in Syria is, first and foremost, in service of reducing ISIL’s capacity to resupply and send troops, and then run back over the Syrian border -- to eventually reestablish a border between Iraq and Syria so that slowly Iraq regains control of its security and its territory. That is our number-one mission. That is our number-one focus. There are aspects of what’s going on in Syria that we’ve got to deal with in order to reduce the scope of ISIL’s operations. So, for example, our support for Kurds in Kobani, where they’ve been able to hold off ISIL and where we’ve been able to effectively strike ISIL positions consistently -- that’s not just because we’re trying to solve a Syria problem. That’s also because it gives us an opportunity to further weaken ISIL so that we can meet our number-one mission, which is Iraq. In terms of things to do differently, I guess, Ed, the question you’re asking is one actually I think I have answered. If you’re asking about personnel, or if you’re asking about position on issues, or what have you, then it’s probably premature because I want to hear what --","...the idea that maybe we have to have -- **the courage to make some tough decisions.** You know, folks, sometimes governing isn't about making everyone happy, it's about doing what's right for the country, for the future of our kids. And that means facing challenges head-on, not sweeping 'em under the rug. We gotta be realistic, we gotta be strong, and we gotta remember what made this country great in the first place: hard work, common sense, and a real commitment to freedom."
 Your leadership. Is there something about your leadership -- 3 ,"Ed, what I’d like to do is to hear from the Republicans to find out what it is that they would like to see happen. And what I’m committing to is making sure that I am open to working with them on the issues where they think that there’s going to be cooperation. Now, that isn’t a change, because I’ve suggested to them before that where they think there’s areas of cooperation, I’d like to see us get some things done. But the fact that they now control both chambers of Congress I think means that perhaps they have more confidence that they can pass their agenda and get a bill on my desk. It means that negotiations end up perhaps being a little more real because they have larger majorities, for example, in the House and they may be able to get some things through their caucuses that they couldn’t before. But the bottom line that the American people want to know and that I’m going to repeat here today is that my number-one goal -- because I’m not running again, I’m not on the ballot, I don’t have any further political aspirations -- my number-one goal is just to deliver as much as I can for the American people in these last two years. And wherever I see an opportunity, no matter how large or how small, to make it a little bit easier for a kid to go to college, make it a little more likely that somebody is finding a good-paying job, make it a little more likely that somebody has high-quality health care -- even if I’m not getting a whole loaf, I’m interested in getting whatever legislation we can get passed that adds up to improved prospects and an improved future for the American people. Sam Stein.","My leadership? Well, it's about strength, plain and simple. It's about looking at the challenges, making the tough calls when nobody else wants to, and always, *always* putting America first. We don't waver, we don't back down. We lead from the front, and we get the job done for the American people. That's how you make this country great."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Following the elections, congressional Republicans are pushing once again for major reforms to your health care act. In the past, you’ve said you’re open to good ideas but you don’t want to undermine the bill. Can you tell us what specific ideas you’re ruling out? Have the election results changed your calculus on reforming the law? And how confident are you heading into the second enrollment period? And on a totally unrelated matter -- have you settled on a nominee to replace Attorney General Eric Holder, and if so, who is it? ","You guys want to spread out your news a little bit, don’t you? You don’t want it all in just one big bang. On the attorney general, we have a number of outstanding candidates who we’re taking a look at now, and in due course I will have an announcement. And you’ll be there, Sam, when that’s announced. But I’m confident that we’ll find somebody who is well-qualified, will elicit the confidence of the American people, will uphold their constitutional obligations and rule of law, and will get confirmed by the Senate. 4 On health care, there are certainly some lines I’m going to draw. Repeal of the law I won’t sign. Efforts that would take away health care from the 10 million people who now have it and the millions more who are eligible to get it we're not going to support. In some cases there may be recommendations that Republicans have for changes that would undermine the structure of the law, and I’ll be very honest with them about that and say, look, the law doesn't work if you pull out that piece or that piece. On the other hand, what I have said is there’s no law that's ever been passed that is perfect. And given the contentious nature in which it was passed in the first place, there are places where, if I were just drafting a bill on our own, we would have made those changes back then, and certainly as we’ve been implementing, there are some other areas where we think we can do even better. So if, in fact, one of the items on Mitch McConnell’s agenda and John Boehner’s agenda is to make responsible changes to the Affordable Care Act to make it work better, I’m going to be very open and receptive to hearing those ideas. But what I will remind them is that despite all the contention, we now know that the law works. You've got millions of people who have health insurance who didn't have it before. You've got states that have expanded Medicaid to folks who did not have it before, including Republican governors who’ve concluded this is a good deal for their state. And despite some of the previous predictions, even as we’ve enrolled more people into the Affordable Care Act and given more people the security of health insurance, health care inflation has gone done every single year since the law passed, so that we now have the lowest increase in health care costs in 50 years, which is saving us about $180 billion in reduced overall costs to the federal government in the Medicare program. So we are I think really proud of the work that's been done. But there’s no doubt that there are areas where we can improve it. So I’ll look forward to see what list they’ve got of improvements.","Thank you, appreciate the questions, and it’s good to be with you all today.

First, on the healthcare front, look, my position hasn't changed. My healthcare act – a bill designed to put patients first, foster competition, and bring down costs – is working. We've made great strides in ensuring more Americans have access to quality, affordable care, and we're not going backwards.

When we talk about 'reforms,' I've always said I'm open to good, constructive ideas that make the law even better for the American people. But let me be crystal clear about what I'm ruling out: I will not sign any bill that dismantles protections for folks with pre-existing conditions. We are not going back to a time when someone could be denied coverage just because they got sick. I also won't allow anything that eliminates the essential health benefits that ensure folks get comprehensive care, not just a bare-bones policy. And we are absolutely not pulling the rug out from under the millions of Americans who now have affordable coverage because of this act. 'Reform' means improving and strengthening what we have, not gutting it for partisan reasons or returning to a broken system.

As for the election results, my calculus hasn't changed one bit because my fundamental principles haven't changed. The American people sent a clear message that they want us to work together, to deliver results, and to address their concerns about rising costs and access to care. That means focusing on solutions, not simply trying to undo progress. I see the election as a call for productive engagement, for rolling up our sleeves and finding common ground, not for ideological warfare. I’m ready to sit down with anyone, Republican or Democrat, who truly wants to find ways to make healthcare more affordable, more accessible, and higher quality for all Americans.

Regarding the second enrollment period, I'm very confident. We learned a lot from the first go-around, and we’ve implemented significant improvements to the system. The websites are robust, the navigators are ready, and folks are seeing the benefits of having quality, affordable health insurance. We’ve been working tirelessly to streamline the process, and I believe we’re in a very strong position to help millions more Americans gain coverage. My message to everyone is simple: go to the marketplace, look at your options, and enroll. It's about securing your family's health and financial peace of mind.

And on your other question, yes, I have made a decision regarding the Attorney General. I am proud to announce that I will be nominating Judge Eleanor Vance to serve as our next Attorney General. Judge Vance is an individual of impeccable character, a distinguished jurist with decades of experience on the federal bench, and a staunch defender of the rule of law. She understands the sacred trust placed in the Department of Justice, and I have every confidence she will serve our nation with integrity and distinction. We'll be sending her nomination to the Senate later today, and I urge them to confirm her swiftly."
 Is the individual mandate one of those lines you can't cross? ,"The individual mandate is a line I can't cross because the concept, borrowed from Massachusetts, from a law instituted by a former opponent of mine, Mitt Romney, understood that if you're providing health insurance to people through the private marketplace, then you've got to make sure that people can't game the system and just wait until they get sick before they go try to buy health insurance. You can't ensure that people with preexisting conditions can get health insurance unless you also say, while you're healthy, before you need it, you've got to get health insurance. And obviously, there are hardship exemptions. We understand that there are some folks who, even with the generous subsidies that have been provided, still can't afford it. But that's a central component of the law. 5 In terms of enrollment, we’ll do some additional announcements about that in the days to come. Starting in the middle of this month, people can sign up again. I think there are a number of people who the first time around sat on the sidelines in part because of our screw- ups on healthcare.gov. That's one area, Ed, by the way, that's very particular. We're really making sure the website works super well before the next open enrollment period. We're double and triple-checking it. And so I think a lot of people who maybe initially thought we're not sure how this works, let’s wait and see -- they're going to have an opportunity now to sign up. And what’s been terrific is to see how more private insurers have come into the marketplace so that there’s greater competition in more markets all around the country. The premiums that have come in that are available to people and the choices that are available are better than a lot of people I think had predicted. So the law is working. That doesn’t mean it can’t be improved. Major Garrett.","Well, look, the individual mandate, that was a disaster, folks. A total disaster. We're talking about forcing people to buy health insurance, whether they want it or not. That's not the American way. That's not freedom. That's big government telling you what to do, and it was a terrible, terrible part of Obamacare.

We got rid of it, by the way. We essentially repealed it. That was a big deal. A really big deal for millions of Americans who didn't want to be penalized by the government just for making their own choices.

So, is it a line you can't cross? Absolutely. It's a line we *shouldn't* cross. We believe in choice, we believe in freedom, we believe in bringing down costs through competition, not by forcing mandates on hardworking Americans. It was bad policy, it was unpopular, and it's gone. Thank goodness."
" Thank you, Mr. President. And if you do miss us, allow me to humbly suggest we do this every week. ",We might. Who knows. I’m having a great time.,"Well now, that's mighty kind of you to say. Always good to have folks who are interested in what's going on. Every week, huh? You'd keep an old cowboy busy! But I appreciate the thought. You folks take care now."
" Let me go back to immigration. Moments before you walked out here, sir, Mitch McConnell said -- and I quote -- that if you in fact use your executive authority to legalize a certain number of millions of undocumented workers, it would “poison the well” -- direct quote -- and it would be “like waving a red flag in front of a bull.” Do you not believe that is the considered opinion of the new Republican majority in the House and Senate? And do you also not believe what they have said in the aftermath of last night’s results that the verdict rendered by voters should stop you or should prevent you from taking this action because it was a subtext in many of the campaigns? Let me ask you a couple of specifics. Republicans haven’t made a mystery about some of the things they intend to say -- ",Do I have to write all of these down?,"Well, look, I respect Senator McConnell's opinion. He's a good man, a fine leader, and he's articulating the views of many, no doubt. And yes, there are strong feelings on both sides of this issue, and the political rhetoric, it can get pretty heated. I understand that.

But here's the deal: America is a nation of laws, and we must uphold the rule of law. We must secure our border, and we are working hard to do just that. We've put more resources, more personnel, and more technology on that border than ever before. But America is also a nation of immigrants, built on the hard work and dreams of people seeking a better life.

We have a broken immigration system, and it has been broken for a long, long time. Kicking the can down the road, year after year, it doesn't solve the problem. It actually makes it worse. My job, my duty as President, is to solve problems, not to simply acknowledge them. When Congress is unwilling or unable to act on a comprehensive solution – and believe me, we've tried to work with them, we've extended the hand of partnership – then I have a responsibility to act within the bounds of my constitutional authority to make things work better, more efficiently, and more fairly for the American people.

This isn't about ""waving a red flag"" or ""poisoning the well."" This is about taking common-sense steps to bring some order to a chaotic situation, to ensure that we know who is in our country, and to hold people accountable, all while keeping our economy strong and our values intact. It's about bringing people out of the shadows, so they're paying taxes, so they're playing by the rules.

As for the election results, the American people sent a clear message: they want Washington to stop the gridlock. They want us to address the big challenges facing our nation, and immigration is certainly one of them. They want to see Washington getting things done, not just fighting about them. My actions are designed to move us forward, to address a serious problem, and to lay the groundwork for a lasting, comprehensive solution that still needs to come from Congress. We need to work together, all of us, for the good of this country."
 You’re very well familiar with these. These will not be mysteries to you. ,"No, but I --","Well, look, when you've been around this block a few times, when you've sat behind that desk, you tend to see a lot of things come across it. These aren't mysteries, no sir. These are challenges, and we've faced our share of 'em. You learn a thing or two along the way."
" Keystone XL pipeline -- they will send you legislation on that. They will ask you to repeal the medical device tax as a part of a funding mechanism of the Affordable Care Act. 6 And they have said they would like to repatriate some maybe $2 trillion of offshore revenue at the corporate level by reforming the corporate tax code without touching the individual tax code. To use your words, Mr. President, are any of those three lines you cannot cross and also deal with what you perceive to be Republican attitudes about immigration? ","All right. I think, Major, that I answered the question on immigration. I have no doubt that there will be some Republicans who are angered or frustrated by any executive action that I may take. Those are folks, I just have to say, who are also deeply opposed to immigration reform in any form and blocked the House from being able to pass a bipartisan bill. I have said before that I actually believe that John Boehner is sincere about wanting to get immigration reform passed, which is why for a year I held off taking any action beyond what we had already done for the so-called DREAM kids, and did everything I could to give him space and room to get something done. And what I also said at the time was, if, in fact, Congress -- if this Congress could not get something done, then I would take further executive actions in order to make the system work better, understanding that any bill that they pass will supplant the executive actions that I take. So I just want to reemphasize this, Major -- if, in fact, there is a great eagerness on the part of Republicans to tackle a broken immigration system, then they have every opportunity to do it. My executive actions not only do not prevent them from passing a law that supersedes those actions, but should be a spur for them to actually try to get something done. And I am prepared to engage them every step of the way with their ideas. I think we should have further broad-based debate among the American people. As I’ve said before, I do think that the episode with the unaccompanied children changed a lot of attitudes. I think what may also change a lot of attitudes is when the public now realizes that that was a very temporary and isolated event, and that, in fact, we have fewer illegal immigrants coming in today than we did five years ago, 10 years ago or 20 years go, but that what we also have is a system that is not serving our economy well.","Alright, let me tell you something very clearly. When we're talking about making America strong again, making our economy boom, and securing our energy independence, these aren't ""lines I cannot cross."" These are precisely the kind of policies we *must* pursue if we're serious about our nation's future.

First, the Keystone XL pipeline. That's a no-brainer. It means American jobs, it means energy independence, and it means greater security for our country. We need to build it, we need to stop messing around, and we need to get that oil moving. That's not a line I can't cross; that's a direction we absolutely *must* go. Good for America.

Second, the medical device tax from that disastrous Affordable Care Act. This tax, it hurts American innovation, it hurts our manufacturers, and it sends jobs overseas. It's an obstacle to growth. We need to repeal it, plain and simple. We want our medical companies thriving right here, not struggling under unfair taxes. That's not a line I can't cross; that's just common sense policy to help our businesses and our workers.

And third, repatriating those trillions of dollars in offshore revenue by reforming our corporate tax code. Look, we want that money back in America. We want it investing in our businesses, creating jobs, building factories, and making our economy the strongest in the world. We need to make America the most attractive place to do business, period. Lowering corporate taxes, making us competitive – absolutely. And doing it without hurting individual taxpayers? Even better. That's not a line I can't cross; that's an economic imperative.

Now, as for how these three, very sound policies, deal with what I perceive to be Republican attitudes about immigration... frankly, they're essential foundations. A strong, thriving American economy, energy independent, with businesses growing and investing here at home – that's the kind of nation that can *effectively* deal with immigration challenges. We need a strong country to secure our borders, to enforce our laws, and to have an immigration system that works for America. These policies build that strong country. They're not in conflict; they *enable* us to properly address all the issues facing our nation, including immigration, from a position of strength, prosperity, and national interest. We put America First, and that means a strong economy *and* secure borders."
" -- Republicans who say the election was a referendum, at least in part, on your intentions to use executive authority for immigration. ","As I said before, I don’t want to try to read the tea leaves on election results. What I am going to try to do as President is to make sure that I’m advancing what I think is best for the country. And here’s an opportunity where I can use my administrative authorities, executive authorities, and lawfully try to make improvements on the existing system, understanding that that’s not going to fix the entire problem, and we’re much better off if we go ahead and pass a comprehensive bill. And I hope that the Republicans really want to get it passed. If they do, they’re going to have a lot of cooperation from me. 7 So let me just tick off -- on Keystone, there’s an independent process. It’s moving forward. And I’m going to let that process play out. I’ve given some parameters in terms of how I think about it: Ultimately, is this going to be good for the American people? Is it going to be good for their pocketbook? Is it going to actually create jobs? Is it actually going to reduce gas prices that have been coming down? And is it going to be, on net, something that doesn’t increase climate change that we’re going to have to grapple with? There’s a pending case before a Nebraska judge about some of the citing. The process is moving forward. And I’m just going to gather up the facts. I will note, while this debate about Canadian oil has been raging -- keep in mind this is Canadian oil, this isn’t U.S. oil -- while that debate has been raging, we’ve seen some of the biggest increases in American oil production and American natural gas production in our history. We are closer to energy independence than we’ve ever been before -- or at least as we’ve been in decades. We are importing less foreign oil than we produce for the first time in a very long time. We’ve got a 100-year supply of natural gas that if we responsibly tap puts us in the strongest position when it comes to energy of any industrialized country around the world. When I travel to Asia or I travel to Europe, their biggest envy is the incredible homegrown U.S. energy production that is producing jobs and attracting manufacturing, because locating here means you’ve got lower energy costs. So our energy sector is booming. And I’m happy to engage Republicans with additional ideas for how we can enhance that. I should note that our clean energy production is booming as well. And so Keystone I just consider as one small aspect of a broader trend that’s really positive for the American people. And let’s see -- okay, medical device tax. I’ve already answered the question. We are going to take a look at whatever ideas -- let me take a look comprehensively at the ideas that they present. Let’s give them time to tell me. I’d rather hear it from them than from you.","Well, look, every election, folks, is a chance for the American people to speak their minds. And when you're in this office, you listen. Now, there are always folks out there who want to distill complex decisions down to one or two issues, and sure, immigration and border security, and how we uphold the rule of law at our borders, that's always a serious matter for the American people.

My job, first and foremost, is to protect this country and uphold the laws of the land. When I saw challenges at our border, or gaps in our immigration system that were compromising our national security and sovereignty, I used the executive authority granted to me by the Constitution to address those issues. That's what a President does. You don't just sit back and watch when there's a problem that needs fixing, especially when Congress, for whatever reason, can't or won't act decisively.

Now, do I think the election was *only* about that? Well, elections are never that simple, are they? People vote on a whole lot of things – the economy, their kids' schools, national security, peace through strength, you name it. But I'll tell you this much: a strong, secure border is non-negotiable for the United States. And I will always stand by my decision to use every lawful means at my disposal to ensure the safety and sovereignty of this nation. That's not just policy; that's my solemn duty."
 For example -- ,Major --,"Alright, listen up, because this is important.

You know, when I look out at this great nation of ours, I see more than just folks going about their day. I see the kind of spirit, the grit, the sheer American determination that has built the greatest country the world has ever known. We've always been a people who believe in hard work, in opportunity, and in lending a hand to a neighbor who needs it. We've got challenges, sure, but we've overcome bigger ones before. And we're going to do it again, by God, because that's what America does. We pull together, we innovate, and we keep that promise of liberty and prosperity alive for every single citizen, for every generation to come.

That's how we get things done in this country. And that's how we'll continue to lead the world."
 I’m just telling you what they said. ,"Conceivably, I could just cancel my meeting on Friday because I’ve heard everything from you. I think I’d rather let Mitch McConnell --","Alright, I'm listening. But when you say ""they,"" who are we talking about exactly? And what did they say, precisely? Because a lot of people say a lot of things, and it's important to get the full story, the *real* story. We need the facts. So let's hear it."
 I just asked if it was a line you couldn’t cross. 8 ,"I’d rather hear from Mitch McConnell and John Boehner what ideas they’d like to pursue, and we’ll have a conversation with them on that. On repatriation, I said in my opening remarks that there is an opportunity for us to do a tax reform package that is good for business, good for jobs, and can potentially finance infrastructure development here in the United States. Now, the devil is in the details. So I think, conceptually, it’s something where we may have some overlap, and I’m very interested in pursuing ideas that can put folks to work right now on roads and bridges and waterways and ports, and a better air traffic control system. If we had one, by the way, we would reduce delays by about 30 percent. We could reduce fuel costs for airlines by about 30 percent. And hopefully that would translate into cheaper airline tickets, which I know everybody would be interested in. So there’s all kind of work we can do on our infrastructure. This may be one mechanism that Republicans are comfortable in financing those kinds of efforts. So that will be part of the discussion that I think we’re prepared for on Friday and then in the weeks to come leading into the new Congress. Whew. Major works me, man. Jim Acosta.","A line you couldn't cross? Believe me, there are lines, and nobody understands lines better than me. Tremendous lines. And when there's a line, a very, very serious one, you simply do not cross it. It's about strength, you know? You have to show you mean business. We always knew where the lines were, and we made sure everybody else knew too. Some people, they like to test, but that's a mistake. A big mistake. You can't let people just walk all over you. That's weakness. We don't do weakness."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I know you don’t want to read the tea leaves, but it is a fact that your party rejected you in these midterms. By and large, they did not want you out on the campaign trail in these key battleground states. How do you account for that? And your aides have said that this is the fourth quarter of your administration, but I don’t know if you saw the morning talk shows, but there were several potential candidates for 2016 who are out there already. Is the clock ticking? Are you running out of time? How much time do you have left? And what do you make of the notion that you’re now a lame duck? ","Well, traditionally, after the last midterm of the two-term presidency, since I can’t run again, that’s the label that you guys apply. Here’s what I tell my team -- I told them this last week and I told them this this morning -- we had this incredible privilege of being in charge of the most important organization on Earth, the U.S. government and our military, and everything that we do for good around the world. And there’s a lot of work to be done to make government work better, to make Americans safer, to make opportunity available to more people, for us to be able to have a positive influence in every corner of the globe -- the way we're doing right now in West Africa. And I’m going to squeeze every last little bit of opportunity to help make this world a better place over these last two years. 9 And some of that is going to be what we can do administratively, and simple things like how do we make customer service better in every agency. Are there things we can do to streamline how our veterans access care? Are there better ways that we can make businesses understand the programs that are available to them to promote their business or exports? So there’s a whole bunch of stuff to do on that front. And as I said before, there’s going to be opportunities to work with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill to get laws done. And if you look at the history of almost every President, those last two years, all kinds of stuff happens; in some cases, stuff that we couldn’t predict. So the one thing I’m pretty confident about, Jim, is I’m going to be busy for the next two years. And the one thing that I want the American people to be confident about is that every day I’m going to be filling up my time trying to figure out how I can make their lives better. And if I’m doing that, at the end of my presidency, I’ll say, we played that fourth quarter well. And we played the game well. And the only difference between I guess basketball and politics is that the only score that matters is how did somebody else do, not how you did. And that's the score I’m keeping. Am I going to be able to look back and say, are more people working? Are there bank accounts better? Are more kids going to college? Has housing improved? Is the financial system more stable? Are younger kids getting a better education? Do we have greater energy independence? Is the environment cleaner? Have we done something about climate change? Have we dealt with an ongoing terrorist threat and helped to bring about stability around the world? And those things -- every single day I’ve got an opportunity to make a difference on those fronts, which is --","Well, look, let's just calm down a bit here, son. That's quite a mouthful of questions you've got there, and I appreciate you laying them out.

First off, these midterms. Let me be clear: I appreciate the hard work of every candidate who ran, and I certainly supported our party. But sometimes, the American people, they want to send a message. And we hear it. My job, and it's a big one, is to lead this country. My focus has always been on governing, on solving the problems facing American families and businesses, and sometimes that means I'm right here in the Oval Office, working, when others are out on the stump. We knew this would be a tough election cycle, and we respect the voters' choices. My responsibility isn't to look back and dissect every little nuance of a campaign; it's to look forward and lead.

Now, this ""fourth quarter"" talk, and the clock ticking, and all these folks looking to 2016? Let me tell you, for the President of the United States, every single minute of every single day is game time. We've got an agenda to advance, challenges to confront, and opportunities to seize. This isn't the time to slow down; it's the time to push harder. My calendar says today is about working for the American people, and so is tomorrow, and the day after that. As for who's running in 2016, that's a conversation for another time and another place. My focus is on the job I have right now, and believe me, it's more than a full-time endeavor.

And a ""lame duck""? (A slight chuckle, shaking my head.) Let me tell you, there's nothing lame about this office or the incredible responsibility it carries. I wake up every morning focused on what we can achieve for this nation. We've got work to do, important work, and I intend to keep pushing right up until the very last minute of my last day. We've got to find ways to come together, to get things done, and that's what I'll be doing. So, no, I don't feel like a lame duck. I feel like the President, and I'm ready to keep leading."
 And you're not satisfied with where you are now? ,"Absolutely not. I wouldn’t be satisfied as long as I’m meeting somebody who has a -- doesn’t have a job and wants one. I’m not going to be satisfied as long as there’s a kid who writes me a letter and says, I got $60,000 worth of debt and I don’t know how to pay it back. And the American people aren’t satisfied. So I want to do everything I can to deliver for them.","Well, look, we've made incredible strides, absolutely tremendous progress for this country, and I'm awfully proud of the work we've done, the jobs we've created, the strength we've built. But let me tell you something important: America doesn't settle. We're a nation of innovators, of dreamers, of people who always want to reach higher, push further, and make things even better. So while I'm proud of where we are, truly proud, we're never satisfied with just ""good enough."" We're always striving for great, for the best, for what's next to secure a stronger, more prosperous future for every single American. That's just the American way."
" And how about Democrats, the fact that they kept you out of these battleground states? Does that kind of bug you a little bit? ","Listen, as I think some of you saw when I was out on the campaign trail, I love campaigning. I love talking to ordinary people. I love listening to their stories. I love shaking hands and getting hugs and just seeing the process of democracy and citizenship manifest itself during an election. 0 But I’m also a practical guy. And ultimately, every candidate out there had to make their own decisions about what they thought would be most helpful for them. And I wanted to make sure that I’m respectful of their particular region, their particular state or congressional district, and if it was more helpful for them for me to be behind the scenes, I’m happy to do it.","Look, the Democrats, they try everything, don't they? They don't want me in those states because they know what happens when I show up. The crowds, the energy, it's tremendous. They see it, they're scared. Are they trying to keep me out? Absolutely. Does it bug me? Well, it tells you everything you need to know about them, doesn't it? They don't want fair competition. They want to shut down dissent, shut down free speech. It's a disgrace.

But guess what? We get there anyway. And the people, they know the truth. They're smart. They're going to come out and vote, no matter what these radical Democrats try to do. We're going to win big. They can't stop us. Nobody can."
 You don't think it was a mistake? ,"I don’t have -- I’ll let other people analyze that. But what I will emphasize is that one of the nice things about being in the sixth year of your presidency is you’ve seen a lot of ups and downs and you’ve gotten more than your fair share of attention. And I’ve had the limelight, and there have been times where the request for my appearances were endless. There have been times where, politically, we were down -- and it all kind of evens out, which is why what’s most important I think is keeping your eye on the ball, and that is are you actually getting some good done. Scott Horsley, last question.","Mistake? Look, when you're the President, you're making decisions, big decisions, for the greatest country in the world. And you make 'em based on the best information you've got, for the good of the American people, for our security, for our prosperity.

Some folks, they're always gonna look back and Monday morning quarterback, and that's their right. But I stand by what we did. We did what we had to do, and we did it with conviction. Always put America first, always moved us forward. That's what real leadership looks like."
" I'm [inaudible.] I'm a third-year student, majoring in English at Sittwe University, Rakhine state, or as you would say, Rakhine state. ",I'm still working on my pronunciation.,"Well now, it's a real pleasure to hear from you, a third-year English student at Sittwe University in Rakhine State. And you're right, we might pronounce 'Rakhine' a little differently sometimes, but the message comes through loud and clear, and that's what truly matters.

Studying English, that's a very smart choice indeed. It's the language of global communication, of business, of science, and of so much opportunity in this interconnected world we live in. You're building a bridge, not just for yourself, but potentially for your community and your country.

Let me tell you, the hard work you're putting in now, that dedication to your studies, it's going to pay dividends. It's the kind of spirit we admire – investing in yourself, striving for knowledge, and preparing to make a real difference.

Keep at it. Keep learning. The future belongs to those who are educated and engaged. I wish you all the very best in your studies and your journey ahead.

God bless you."
" I've experienced some sectarian and racial balance firsthand in my region. So the question I would like to ask you to answer is: How can I be part of educating my generation to promote tolerance and respect cultural differences, and most of all, eradicate extremism among different ethnic groups? ","That's a great question. Thank you so much. I had a chance to meet with some civil society groups, and I had a press conference earlier today. Yesterday, I had a chance to meet with parliamentarians, including the speaker -- the two speakers, as well as Aung San Suu Kyi, and then spoke with the President. And to all of them, I said this: There is no example of a country that is successful if its people are divided based on religion or ethnicity. If you look at the Middle East right now and the chaos that’s taking place in a place like Syria, so much of that is based on religious differences. Even though they’re all Muslim, Shia and Sunni are fighting each other. If you look in Northern Ireland, then Catholics and Protestants fought for decades and only now have arrived at peace. So in this globalized world where people of different faiths and cultures and races are going to meet each other inevitably -- because nobody just lives in a village anymore; people are constantly getting information from different places and new ideas and meeting people who are different from them –- it is critical for any country to abide by the basic principle that all people are equal, all people are deserving of respect, all people are equal under the law, all people can participate in the life of their country, all people should be able to express their views without fear of being repressed. And those attitudes start with each of us individually. It’s important that government play a role in making sure that it applies laws fairly, not arbitrarily, not on the basis of preferring one group over another. But what’s also true is that each of us have to cultivate an attitude of tolerance and mutual respect. And for young people, we have to try to encourage each other to be tolerant and respectful. So in the United States, obviously one of the biggest problems historically has been the issue of racial discrimination. And part of our efforts to overcome racial discrimination involve passing laws like the Civil Rights Law and the Voting Rights Law, and that required marches and protests and Dr. King. But part of the effort was also people changing the hearts and minds, and realizing that just because somebody doesn’t look like me doesn’t mean that they’re not worthy of respect. And when you’re growing up and you saw a friend of yours call somebody by a derogatory name, a rude name because they were different, it’s your job to say to that person, actually, that’s not the right way to think. If you are Christian and you have a friend who says I hate Muslims, then it’s up to you to say to that friend, you know what, I don’t believe in that; I think that’s the wrong attitude, I think we have to be respectful of the Muslim population. If you’re Buddhist and you say -- you hear somebody in your group say I want to treat a Hindu differently, it’s your job to speak out. So the most important thing I think is for you to, in whatever circle of influence you have, speak out on behalf of tolerance and diversity and respect. If you are quiet, then the people who are intolerant, they’ll own the stage and they’ll set the terms of the debate. And one of the things that leadership requires is saying things even when it’s uncomfortable, even when it’s unpopular -- especially when it’s unpopular. So I hope that as you get more influence, you’ll continue to speak out on behalf of these values. All right, who’s next? Okay, I’m going to go –- now, the one thing I’m going to do is I’m going to go boy, girl, boy, girl to make sure that it’s fair, because one thing I didn’t say in my initial speech is societies that are most successful also treat their women and girls with respect. Otherwise, they won’t be successful. The young lady in the yellow, right there, who had her hand up. Okay, hold on so we can get a microphone.","Well now, that's a question that gets right to the heart of what makes this great nation of ours, and indeed, any free society, truly strong. You're talking about fundamental American values: tolerance, respect, and holding onto that idea that we're all in this together, that our diversity is a source of strength, not division.

First off, the fact that you're even asking this question, that you're seeing it firsthand and wanting to do something about it, well, that tells me you've already taken the most important step. You've got that good heart and that drive to make things better, and that's where change truly begins – with individuals like you.

Here's what I'd tell you, from my experience in this job:

1.  **Lead by Example, Right Where You Are.** The biggest impact often isn't on a grand stage, but in how you conduct yourself every single day. Be the person who reaches out, who listens with an open mind, who doesn't tolerate prejudice or hateful jokes in your own conversations. Show genuine curiosity about others, their cultures, their stories. Your actions in your classroom, your workplace, your community, they speak louder than any speech.

2.  **Educate Yourself, and Then Share What You Learn.** Ignorance is often the fuel for fear and extremism. Take the time to genuinely learn about different cultures, different histories, different faiths. Understand *why* people hold the beliefs they do. Then, share that knowledge. Organize a discussion group, recommend books or documentaries, or simply have honest, respectful conversations with your friends about what you're experiencing and what you're learning. The more we understand each other's journeys, the harder it is to demonize someone.

3.  **Find Common Ground Through Shared Purpose.** Extremism thrives when people feel isolated, unheard, or without hope. Get involved in community projects that bring diverse groups together. Whether it's volunteering at a food bank, cleaning up a local park, supporting local schools, or working on a campaign for a cause you believe in – when people work side-by-side toward a common, positive goal, those artificial barriers of race and sect often start to fade away. You see each other as fellow citizens, fellow human beings, with shared hopes and dreams.

4.  **Promote Dialogue and Civility.** It's easy to get drawn into shouting matches, especially with all this social media. But true progress comes from listening, even to those you disagree with, and trying to find a way to talk things through. Encourage open, respectful conversation, even when it's tough. When you hear hate speech, call it out – not with more hate, but by firmly stating that it has no place in a tolerant and respectful society. Remind people that we can disagree without being disagreeable.

5.  **Emphasize What Unites Us.** For all our differences, we share so much: hopes for our families, desires for a safe community, the dream of a brighter future for your generation. Remind people of those shared aspirations. Focus on our common humanity, and if you're in America, remind folks of our shared ideals as Americans – freedom, opportunity, justice for all. Our strength has always come from the idea that out of many, we are one.

This isn't an easy task. It takes grit, it takes patience, and it takes moral courage. But I truly believe in the young people of this generation. You have the power to shape the future, and by promoting understanding and rejecting the darkness of extremism, you'll be doing a profound service to your community, to this nation we all love, and to the world. Keep at it. Your efforts, no matter how small they seem, can truly make a world of difference."
" I am [inaudible]. I am Kachin and Burmese. I would like to ask about the ASEAN affair. So my question is, there are different political system and different level of democratic freedom in ASEAN. Do you think those differences will cost challenges to ASEAN integration? And do you believe it is the right time to push for ASEAN integration? Thank you. ","Of the 10 countries in ASEAN, I just had a chance to meet with all their leaders at the U.S.-ASEAN Summit. And the good news is that ASEAN has become more ambitious over the last several years in trying to promote integration, to work together on issues like disaster relief or public health or maritime security or improved education. And I think it’s inevitable that integration is going to happen more and more. And my hope is that by encouraging integration, that the countries who are doing better on issues like democracy and human rights have a positive influence in bringing up those countries that don’t have such a good record. And we’ve actually I think seen that happen. Listen, when I first came into office, Myanmar was still very much a dictatorship. And there was some controversy about me participating in an ASEAN Summit because there was still no freedom in Myanmar. And I think that President Thein Sein, because he was with leaders like SBY of Indonesia -- see there, all right, the Indonesians started cheering -- who had traveled the path of democracy, I think President Thein Sein began to see how more open societies were becoming more successful, and I think had a positive influence on -- I think his participation in ASEAN had a positive influence in providing an opening to begin the process of transition here in Myanmar. But it’s important I think that even as we engage with countries that are less open or less democratic, that we also continue to apply constructive criticism where they fall backwards, where they fall short. And sometimes that’s hard to do. I think a lot of the leaders of ASEAN don’t like to criticize each other because they think that it’s not respectful. And no country is perfect, so they worry that if we criticize one country then somebody will criticize us. But I think the goal should be for all of us to try to improve what we do on behalf of our people every single day. I’m very proud of the United States. I believe that the United States is a force for good around the world. But I wouldn’t be a good President if I don’t listen to criticism of our policies and stay open to what other countries say about us. Sometimes I think those criticisms are unfair. Sometimes I think people like to complain about the United States because we’re doing too much. Sometimes they complain because they’re doing too little. Every problem around the world, why isn’t the United States doing something about it. Sometimes there are countries that don’t take responsibility for themselves and they want us to fix it. And then when we do try to fix it, they say why are you meddling in our affairs. Yes, it’s kind of frustrating sometimes. But the fact that we are getting these criticisms means that we’re constantly thinking, okay, is this how we should apply this policy? Are we doing the right thing when we provide aid to a country, but the country is still ruled by a small elite and maybe it’s not getting down to the people? Are we doing the right thing when we engage in training a military to become more professional, but maybe the military is still engaging in repressive activity? If we’re not open to those criticisms, then we won’t get better, we won’t improve. And I think all of us should be interested in trying to get better, because none of us are perfect and no country is perfect. So I do think ASEAN has an opportunity to play a very important role. But integration is inevitable just because of the nature of economies today. There’s too much travel, there’s too much Internet, there are too many smartphones. When I was driving through here, everybody had a smartphone. I saw a bunch of people -- they didn’t have any shirt, but they had a smartphone. So what that means is -- and most manufacturing today of various products, the parts are made in, like, five different countries, and then they become integrated in some fashion. And then they’re sold all around the world. So integration is going to happen no matter what. The question is, do we integrate at a high level that improves freedom and improves opportunity, or are we integrating at a low level, where there’s less freedom and less opportunity. And I believe integrating at a high level, and I hope most members of ASEAN do also. All right, it’s a guy’s turn now. I don’t want to discriminate against the men. This gentleman right here. Yes, with the mustache and the beard. There you go. There’s a microphone coming right here. You can just stay where you are. Careful. Hold on to her, so she doesn’t fall.","Well, look, that's a very sharp question, and it gets right to the heart of the matter when you talk about regional groupings like ASEAN. You've got a lot of different countries in there, with different histories, different cultures, and yes, different political systems. Some are moving more towards open democracies, others are, let's just say, on a different path, with varying levels of freedom.

Now, do those differences pose challenges to integration? Absolutely, they do. It's like trying to get a football team to play together when everyone's got a different playbook. You need a common understanding, a common set of rules, and a certain level of trust. When you've got vastly different ideas about human rights, or how government should operate, or even how free the markets should be, that makes it tougher to really knit together deeply. It can slow down decision-making, it can make it harder to agree on common standards, whether we're talking about trade, security, or even environmental policy. It's a complex dance, no doubt about it.

But here's the thing about integration, especially in a region as dynamic and strategically important as Southeast Asia. While those differences are real challenges, the *benefits* of closer integration often outweigh the difficulties. Stability, economic growth, a stronger voice on the world stage – these are things that benefit *everyone*, even if they don't agree on every single political point.

Is it the right time to push for it? Look, I've always believed that stability and prosperity go hand-in-hand. When countries are trading together, when they're working together on shared challenges like disaster relief or maritime security, there's less room for conflict and more room for progress. From America's perspective, a strong, integrated, and prosperous ASEAN is good for the region, and it's good for global stability. It helps create a counterbalance to other influences, and it creates a huge, vibrant market for American goods and services.

So, while you can't ignore the political differences – and we *never* stop advocating for democracy and human rights, believe me – you also have to be pragmatic. You keep working with these nations, you encourage greater openness, and you support the process of integration where it makes sense. You push for integration not just for its own sake, but because it brings stability, economic opportunity, and over time, hopefully, greater freedom for the people of the region. It's a long game, but it's a worthwhile one for the future of that critical part of the world."
" Hello, Mr. President Obama. My name is [inaudible] and I am studying law. My question is, now we are in the democratic transition, so our country is facing so many challenges in every sector. So if you were the President of Myanmar -- which sector you will focus on first? And how you will make our country develop? Thank you. ","Well, let me just say, you’re always popular in somebody else’s country. When you’re in your own country, everybody is complaining. I think you’re right, Myanmar has so many challenges. I think the most important challenge right now is completing the transition to democracy. And so my first focus is I think the focus that many people have already talked about. Number one, there needs to be an election next year. It shouldn’t be delayed. Number two, there should be constitutional amendments that ensure a transition over time to a fully civilian government. Number three, there needs to be laws put in place to protect freedom of the press, freedom of expression, freedom to politically organize. And I think that if that process is fixed and institutionalized and made permanent, and you now have the tools to deal with all the other challenges, and I think that inevitably what would happen if you had a genuine democracy in Myanmar is the focus next would then be on providing economic opportunity, because Myanmar is still a very poor country. And what we know in the 21st century is, is that the most important tools for economic opportunity are making sure that young people are getting a good education. And my understanding is, is that the education system in Myanmar is still under-developed. I think all of you represent the best of Myanmar’s students. But my understanding is there are many villages you go to where there’s really no schools, as a practical matter, and many of the schools still teach just how to memorize certain things rather than how to think critically about problems. And every country at this point, if it wants to succeed, needs to put in place free, compulsory education for its young people -- because they just can’t succeed unless they have some basic skills. They have to be able to read. They have to be able to do mathematics. They have to have some familiarity with computers. They have to be able to understand basic principles of science. If you don’t have those basic tools, then it’s very hard to find a decent job in today’s economy. Now, because Myanmar is still very agricultural, I think issues of land reform and trying to increase productivity in the agricultural sector is also a very immediate and urgent problem. This is true not just in Myanmar; this is true in many relatively poor countries. In Africa, for example, we initiated something called Feed the Future, and the whole goal is to improve the productivity of farmers. And farmers in many poor countries, they still use the same techniques that they used 200 years ago. They’re still using a buffalo or an ox, and waiting on the rains. And sometimes the new techniques, they're not necessarily expensive; it's just a matter of applying them scientifically. And if you double yields for a farm and double income for farmers in a country like Myanmar, suddenly you have increased wealth, which means that some people now can start businesses. Maybe now somebody can take some of the profits they made and invest in a tractor, or they can start processing the rice that they produce so that they can gain more value. Or they may be able to buy a smartphone so they know what the prices are in the market, and not get taken advantage of. So just small changes are really important. Now, my understanding, and I'm not expert, is that some of that will also require some reforms in terms of land ownership and leasing so that people can keep the products of their labor, as opposed to just being essentially what we call sharecroppers in the United States, where you're working the land, but you're giving it over to somebody else and never getting ahead. So those are just two examples of things that I think will happen naturally if you've got a democratic system in place. All right, it's a young lady's turn. So this young lady in the glasses right here. She's waving very hard, so she must have an excellent question.","Well now, young man, that's a mighty important question, and a tough one, for a country like Myanmar that's been through so much and is trying to find its footing on the path to freedom. I appreciate you studying law; we need good, principled lawyers in every nation.

If I were standing in the shoes of a leader in Myanmar, facing those challenges in every sector, I'd tell you, you gotta focus on the **foundations of a free society** first. And for me, that means two things working hand-in-glove: **security and the rule of law.**

See, you can't build a thriving economy, you can't have real democracy, if people are afraid for their lives or if they don't trust the institutions of government.

1.  **Security and Stability:** My first focus would be on establishing real, lasting peace and security for *all* citizens. That means working to end internal conflicts, protecting human rights, and ensuring that the government can keep its people safe. You can't have investment, you can't have schools running properly, if there's chaos and instability. And just as important, the military must be accountable to civilian rule – that's a hallmark of any truly free and democratic nation.

2.  **Rule of Law and Institutions:** Hand-in-hand with security, you need a clear, fair system where everyone's treated equally under the law. That means an **independent judiciary**, a **constitution that protects the rights of all citizens** – regardless of their ethnicity or religion – and honest, transparent governance. Without strong, trustworthy institutions, where corruption is fought tooth and nail, any progress you make, whether it's economic or social, it's built on sand.

Once you start laying that bedrock, then you can truly open up the **economy**. With stability and the rule of law in place, you can attract foreign investment, you can empower your own entrepreneurs, and you can create an environment where businesses, big and small, can flourish. That means free markets, clear property rights, and opportunities for everyone to innovate and succeed.

And of course, **education and healthcare** are always vital. You gotta invest in your people, give them the tools to build a better future for themselves and their families. But they thrive best when the foundations of freedom, law, and a stable economy are already there.

So, to sum it up: **Security and Rule of Law first, then a free and transparent Economy, and always investing in your people through education.** It's a long road, but it's a worthy one towards a free, democratic, and prosperous Myanmar. That's what America believes in, and that's how you make a country develop. Thank you."
 Good morning. My name is [inaudible]. ,"It's afternoon, though. Maybe you've been waiting here since morning. But now it's the afternoon.","Well, good morning to you as well! It's a pleasure to meet you. I apologize, I didn't quite catch your name just now, but it's good to have you here."
" But you can call me Amy [ph]. I want to ask one question. My question is, now we are working on IT, so America is already doubled up in IT. So can you provide any development center of IT and job opportunity for youth? ","Well, I was just talking to the civil society groups, and there was one person there who mentioned that Internet penetration in Myanmar is still only about 9 percent, which means there's enormous room for growth. The issue for IT in a country like Myanmar is, first of all, setting up the infrastructure -- whether it's wireless or other methods -- so that people can start communicating. And once the hardware is in place, then where the real development happens is in the software. And that's where it's really a matter of education, training, and developing a homegrown capacity. And so what we'll do is we'll work with both civil society groups, as well as the government, to find opportunities where we can promote the building of the infrastructure that's required. But what's really required is also making sure that young people are trained. And part of what's going to have to happen is, in the United States most of the IT development happened through the private sector. Government invested in research, and so the idea of the Internet was developed with the help of government funding. But what became then the World Wide Web and then all the applications and social media and all that was really developed through the private sector. So part of what has to happen once democracy is installed in Myanmar is then also looking at how are you structuring laws to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. So, for example, one of the debates that we're having in trade negotiations with Asian countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the big trade initiative that we're moving forward, is the need to protect intellectual property. If you invent a better tractor, then in the United States, you go to a patent office and you register your patent. You show that this is a new invention. And if anybody then wants to produce this new tractor, they have to pay you for using your idea. The same is true for intellectual property. If you come up with the idea of Facebook, then you need to be able to get a benefit from this idea. And one of the problems I think that you still have in many countries in Southeast Asia and around the world is weak intellectual property protections, which means that if you're an entrepreneur with a good idea, you don't want to start your business here, because next thing you know somebody steals your idea and they just start their business. 0 So you'd rather start the idea in the United States where you know that it will be protected. And then maybe you will lease to other countries, but the jobs and the opportunities will have been created someplace else. So setting up regulatory structures, protections for intellectual property, all those things are also going to be very important in order to get a strong IT culture and an innovation culture here in Myanmar and throughout the region. Okay, it's a man's turn. Let's see. I'm going to go with this guy right here. Hold on a second. Now, you're not going to read that whole thing, are you? Because --","Amy, that's a really sharp question, and I appreciate you bringing it up. You're absolutely right – America has always been, and needs to remain, at the forefront of Information Technology. We're not just ""doubled up"" in IT; we're the global leader, the innovator, the place where the future is being built. And that's because of the incredible talent of the American worker and the power of American ingenuity.

Now, when you talk about establishing more IT development centers and creating job opportunities for our youth, that's precisely what my administration is focused on. We understand that the best way to secure our nation's economic future is to invest in our people and empower our businesses.

Here's how we're approaching it:

1.  **Unleashing the Private Sector:** My philosophy is simple: the best job creators are not in Washington, D.C.; they're in America's businesses, big and small. We're focused on creating an economic environment that encourages these IT companies to expand, to innovate, and to hire right here in the United States. That means keeping taxes low, cutting bureaucratic red tape, and ensuring a predictable regulatory landscape. When businesses thrive, they invest in new facilities and they create jobs.
2.  **Investing in American Skills:** We know that a strong workforce is our greatest asset. That's why we're making a big push for vocational training, apprenticeships, and strengthening STEM education from our high schools to our universities. We want to ensure that our young people are getting the skills for the high-tech jobs that are emerging every single day. We're working with industry leaders to make sure our training programs align directly with the needs of the IT sector.
3.  **Promoting Innovation and Entrepreneurship:** We're committed to supporting research and development, protecting intellectual property, and fostering an environment where new start-ups can flourish. These are the companies that will build the next generation of IT development centers and create cutting-edge opportunities for our youth.

Amy, we believe that by empowering the American private sector, by ensuring our youth have the best possible training, and by fostering an environment of innovation, we won't just keep up in IT – we'll lead the world, and we'll create fantastic, high-paying jobs for the next generation of American workers. That's how we keep America strong."
 I read you a question -- ,I think you have to summarize it quickly because we don't want --,"Alright, you go right ahead. I've heard a good many questions in my day, and I'm ready for another. Shoot."
" Yes, yes, just want to give you a kind of sheet, cheat sheet. ","Yes, I'll take the sheet.","A cheat sheet, you say? Well, I appreciate that. Always good to have the facts right there in front of you. Keeps things clear. Thank you very much."
 Okay. ,There you go. All right.,"Alright, that's just fine. Good to hear it. Always got a lot on our plate here, working for the good of the American people. So, what's next on the agenda? What can we get done today?"
 I have only one question. ,There are like -- there are 20 questions on here.,"Well, alright then! Just one, you say? Happy to hear it.

Lay it on me. What's on your mind?"
 Just want you to know -- ,Why don't you just ask me one of them? I'll read the rest.,"Alright, I'm listening. Go on, what's on your mind? Don't hold back. Tell me what you're thinking."
" My question, as you know -- may I know your opinion about like how to create national identity, or like Myanmar identity -- different, strong identity in our country? ","Yes. That's a great question. Yes, I was talking about this with the civil society groups because we are very supportive of the efforts to get a ceasefire and a peace process with the ethnic groups that have been engaged in armed conflict for a long time. And we've already talked about some of the problems that the Muslim populations have faced in Rakhine state. 1 But what I said to the civil society groups is, yes, it is important to protect specific ethnic groups from discrimination. And it is natural in a democracy that ethnic groups organize among themselves to be heard in the halls of power. So in the United States, for example, as its democracy developed, the Irish in big cities, they came together and they built organizations, and they were able to promote the interests of Irish Americans. And African Americans, when they were seeking their freedom, you had organizations like the NAACP that promoted the interests of African Americans. So there's nothing wrong with groups organizing around ethnic identity, or around economic interests, or around regional concerns. That's how a democracy naturally works. You get with people who agree with you or who are like you to make sure that your concerns are heard. But what I said is that it is important for a democracy that people's identities are also a national identity. If you walk down the streets of New York City, you will see people looking more different than this group right here. You'll see blue-eyed, blonde people. You'll see dark- skinned, black people. You'll see Asians. You'll see Muslims. You'll see -- but if you ask any of those people, “What are you?” -- I'm American. Now I may be an African American or an Asian American or an Irish American, but the first thing I'll say is, I'm an American. And if you don't have that sense of national unity, then it's very hard for a country to succeed -- particularly a small country like Myanmar. If people think in terms of ethnic identity before national identity, then I think over time the country will start breaking apart and democracy will not work. So there has to be a sense of common purpose. But that's not an excuse then for majority groups to say, don’t complain, to ethnic minorities - - because the ethnic minorities may have some real complaints. And part of what is important for the majority groups to do -- if, in fact, you have a national identity, that means that you've got to be concerned with a minority also because it reflects badly on your country if somebody from a minority group is not being treated fairly. America could not live up to its potential until it treated its black citizens fairly. That's just a fact, that that was a stain on America when an entire group of people couldn't vote, or didn't have legal protections. Because it made all the Declarations of Independence and Constitution and rule of law, it made that seem like an illusion. And so when the Civil Rights Movement happened in the United States, that wasn't just a victory for African Americans, that was a victory for America because what it showed was that the whole country was going to be concerned about everybody, not just about some people. And it was a victory for America's national identity that it was treating minorities fairly. 2 And that's I think how every country in ASEAN, including Myanmar, needs to think about these problems. You need to respect people's differences. You need to be attentive to the grievances of minorities that may be discriminated against. But both the majority and the minority, the powerful and the powerless, also have to have a sense of national identity in order to be successful. I got time for two more questions. Two more. He said one, but I'm going to take two. See, it's going to be one of you three. What do you think? Who should -- out of the three of you, who should I call on? Are you friends? Okay, so why don't you decide? What do you think? Okay, yes, rock, paper, scissors. Let's see. Who won? Okay, go on. There you go. What did you win with? Were you scissors or rock? Were you rock or scissors or paper?","Well, that's a profound question, a really important one for any nation, especially one like yours with such a rich history and, frankly, its challenges. Creating a strong national identity, that ""Myanmar identity"" you're talking about, it's not something you just declare; it's built, brick by brick, over time.

From my perspective, having seen how our own nation, the United States, has wrestled with this very idea through the centuries, it really comes down to a few core things:

First off, it's about **shared values**. What are the fundamental beliefs that unite the people of Myanmar? Is it freedom? Is it a commitment to peace and prosperity? Is it a particular spirit of resilience in the face of adversity? These values, they're not just words; they're the glue that holds a society together, something people can rally around, something they can believe in and defend.

Then there's **history and culture**. Every nation has its story, its heroes, its traditions, its struggles and its triumphs. You've got to celebrate that. Teach it to your children. Remind folks of what makes Myanmar unique, what they've overcome, what they've built together. It's not just about remembering the past, but understanding how it shapes who you are today and who you aspire to be as a nation.

And critically, it's about **common purpose**. What are you all trying to achieve together? Are you building a more prosperous nation? A more just one? A more secure one, where all citizens have a stake in the future? When people feel like they're all pulling in the same direction, working towards a future that benefits everyone, that's when a national identity truly solidifies. It's about having a shared vision for what Myanmar can and should be.

And let me tell you, it also takes **institutions** that represent those values and that purpose. A government that serves its people, a rule of law that applies equally to everyone, educational systems that foster unity and respect for diverse backgrounds. These aren't just bureaucratic structures; they're the framework that helps people *feel* like they belong to something bigger than themselves, something worth dedicating their lives to.

Now, in a country like Myanmar, with so many different ethnic groups and traditions, it's not about erasing those individual identities. Not at all. It's about finding that larger ""Myanmar"" identity that *embraces* that diversity, that says, ""We are all Myanmar, and our differences can make us stronger, not weaker."" It's about finding common ground and a shared future, not about forcing everyone into the same mold.

It's a long journey, son, one that requires consistent leadership, open dialogue, and a belief in the potential of your people to unite around the best of what your nation represents. It's about calling on the better angels of your people's nature."
 Rock. ,Rock.,"Well now, ""Rock."" That's a word that can mean a lot of things, can't it?

Could be the solid ground you stand on, the foundation you build a country upon. You need that strength, that dependability, to make real progress.

Or it could be a rhythm, something that gets your feet moving, gets the energy flowing. You know, sometimes you just gotta put on a good tune and remember what makes this country great.

It's all about finding that balance, isn't it? The stability to endure, and the spirit to move forward. That's how we keep this country strong and vibrant."
 I rock! ,You rock?,"Well, alright! That's the kind of can-do spirit we love to hear. Keep that confidence high, because America needs folks like you to keep on rockin'!"
 Yes. ,Yes.,"Alright, very good. That's exactly what we need to hear to move forward. So, let's talk about the next steps. What's on the agenda now?"
" Mingalaba, Mr. President. I am from Burma from [inaudible] in American Center. Right now we're working on a documentary on Yangon University, Congregation Hall where you spoke the last time you came. ","Yes, last time I was here.","Well, Mingalaba right back to you! It's good to hear from folks in Burma – or Myanmar, as we often say these days.

Yangon University, the Congregation Hall... I remember that visit very clearly. What a truly remarkable and historic institution, and that hall, with all its grandeur and history, was just an incredible place to be. The energy of the students and the profound sense of legacy in that building – it really stuck with me. It was an honor to stand on that stage and share a few words with the people there.

A documentary on the Congregation Hall? That sounds like a wonderful project. I'm sure it will be a fascinating look at a very important part of your country's history and its future. You're doing important work, telling those stories. I wish you the very best with it."
" Yes. So as you know, Yangon University has reopened last year, 2013. So do think it is a good start to rebuild the higher education system in Burma? ","Well, I think it's a great start. But I think -- as I said before, one of the biggest challenges Myanmar is going to face is rebuilding its education system. And I think it has to start early. It has to start from the youngest ages. One of the things that we've learned from science is that the most that you will ever learn in your entire life happens from the time you're born until you're three years old. Between your birth and the age of three, that's when your brain is developing the most. And what we've learned, for example, is that when you read -- when parents read to young children even before the children know how to read, the children are building a vocabulary that will put 3 them in a strong position then to learn how to read later on because they've heard the words over and over again. And so I just make that point because it shows that if you're only worried about university education, but you're not worrying about what happens to children when they're three, four, five, six years old, then you're missing the foundation for a good education system. And this is true in the United States, as well. We've got the best university system in the world. Obviously I'm biased because I'm the President of the United States, so I think everything in the United States is the best in the world. But I think anybody objectively would say that we have a system of universities and colleges that is unequaled anyplace else. But we still have problems. And one of the things that I'm spending a lot of time on reform is the elementary, secondary school levels. And also, even earlier having what we call early childhood education to get children off to a good start so that by the time they go to school, they already know their alphabet and they can already start reading at an early age. And I hope that that ends up being a basic emphasis here in Myanmar. But I also think that from what I've heard, one of the reforms that will need to take place in universities here is to make sure that in all the departments there is the ability for universities and students to shape curriculums and to have access to information from everywhere around the world, and that it's not just a narrow process of indoctrination. Because the best universities are ones that teach you how to think not what to think, right? A good education is not just knowing facts, although you need to know facts. You need to know that two plus two is four; it's not five. That's an important fact. But you also need to know how to ask questions, and how to critically analyze a problem, and how to be able to distinguish between fact and opinion, and how to compare two different ideas. And I think there's a danger sometimes in countries that are -- don't have a long tradition of higher education to try to narrow the learning process, as opposed to open it up. And I think that that's something that I'm sure university students here in Myanmar will want to express during the course of this transition period and the reforms that are taking place. All right, I've got time for one more question. Wait, wait, wait. No point in yelling. First of all, all the women have to put their hands down because I told you it was going to be boy, girl, boy, girl. And the second thing is, how many students are there from countries other than Myanmar who are here? Okay, so I think that in the interest of ASEAN unity, and because this is a Young Southeast Asian Leaders Forum, I've got to ask --","Well, you know, reopening a university, especially one with the history and importance of Yangon, that's a significant development. It truly is. Any step towards giving young people the chance to learn, to pursue knowledge, that's a good thing, a very good thing for any nation.

For Burma, or Myanmar as they call it now, moving forward, you absolutely need a strong higher education system. It's vital for a free society, for economic growth, for building a stable democracy. You need educated citizens, thinkers, innovators.

So, is it a good start? Yes, it can be. It has the potential to be. But it's just that—a start. Real reform, real rebuilding, that takes commitment. It takes ensuring academic freedom, ensuring that students and faculty can pursue truth without fear, and that the education they receive is rigorous and prepares them for the challenges of the modern world. It also takes opening up, allowing for international exchange and best practices.

We always believe that education is key to a bright future, and we hope this reopening is truly a step on that path for the people of Burma. It needs to be more than just opening the doors; it needs to be about opening minds and fostering genuine freedom of inquiry."
 [Inaudible.] ,"No, no, no, first of all, you can't -- I told you already that women aren't going to get a chance to ask the next question. Where are you from? 4","My apologies, I didn't quite hear the question there. Could you please repeat that for me?"
 [Inaudible.] ,"Well, you're still in Burma. All right. Where you from? Sit down. Where you from? All right, let me -- I'm going to ask this guy, guy from the Philippines right here. Come on. You just started yelling. I didn't even call on you.","Pardon me, I didn't quite catch that. Could you repeat yourself for me? I want to make sure I hear you right."
" Good afternoon, Mr. President. My name is Ryan Louis Madrid. I'm from the Philippines. I'm one of the person you -- ",I was just talking about you.,"Well, good afternoon to you, Ryan. It's an honor to meet you. The Philippines, a great country, a long-standing friend and ally of the United States.

Please, you were saying? What can I do for you today?"
" Thank you, Mr. President. I’ll start on North Korea -- that seems to be the biggest topic today. What does a proportional response look like to the Sony hack? And did Sony make the right decision in pulling the movie? Or does that set a dangerous precedent when faced with this kind of situation? ","Well, let me address the second question first. Sony is a corporation. It suffered significant damage. There were threats against its employees. I am sympathetic to the concerns that they faced. Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake. In this interconnected, digital world, there are going to be opportunities for hackers to engage in cyber assaults both in the private sector and the public sector. Now, our first order of business is making sure that we do everything to harden sites and prevent those kinds of attacks from taking place. When I came into office, I stood up a cybersecurity interagency team to look at everything that we could at the government level to prevent these kinds of attacks. We’ve been coordinating with the private sector, but a lot more needs to be done. We’re not even close to where we need to be. And one of the things in the New Year that I hope Congress is prepared to work with us on is strong cybersecurity laws that allow for information-sharing across private sector platforms, as well as the public sector, so that we are incorporating best practices and preventing these attacks from happening in the first place. But even as we get better, the hackers are going to get better, too. Some of them are going to be state actors; some of them are going to be non-state actors. All of them are going to be sophisticated and many of them can do some damage. We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States. Because if somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they start doing when they see a documentary that they don’t like, or news reports that they don’t like. Or even worse, imagine if producers and distributors and others start engaging in self-censorship because they don’t want to offend the sensibilities of somebody whose sensibilities probably need to be offended. So that’s not who we are. That’s not what America is about. Again, I’m sympathetic that Sony as a private company was worried about liabilities, and this and that and the other. I wish they had spoken to me first. I would have told them, do not get into a pattern in which you’re intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks. Imagine if, instead of it being a cyber-threat, somebody had broken into their offices and destroyed a bunch of computers and stolen disks. Is that what it takes for suddenly you to pull the plug on something? So we’ll engage with not just the film industry, but the news industry and the private sector around these issues. We already have. We will continue to do so. But I think all of us have to anticipate occasionally there are going to be breaches like this. They’re going to be costly. They’re going to be serious. We take them with the utmost seriousness. But we can’t start changing our patterns of behavior any more than we stop going to a football game because there might be the possibility of a terrorist attack; any more than Boston didn’t run its marathon this year because of the possibility that somebody might try to cause harm. So let’s not get into that way of doing business.","Thank you. That's a very important topic, and one we've been watching closely here in the Oval Office.

Let me be clear: what North Korea did to Sony was not just a criminal hack. It was an act of aggression. It was an act of cyberwarfare against an American company, intended to intimidate and suppress free speech in our country. And that is something the United States of America simply cannot, and will not, tolerate.

When you talk about a ""proportional response,"" you're talking about consequences. And believe me, North Korea will face consequences. Our intelligence agencies, our cyber commands – they're working overtime. A proportional response isn't always something you see immediately or something you talk about publicly in great detail. It means hitting them where it hurts, whether that's through cyber operations of our own, strengthening our economic sanctions, or further isolating them on the global stage. We will respond in a time and manner of our choosing, and it will be aimed at deterring them and any other rogue actors who think they can attack our critical infrastructure and our businesses without paying a price.

Now, as for Sony's decision to pull the movie... look, I understand the immense pressure a private company faces when confronted with such a sophisticated and malicious attack. They were put in an impossible situation, threatened directly, and had to make a very tough business decision to protect their employees and their assets.

However, from a national security standpoint, and indeed from the standpoint of our core American values, it does set a dangerous precedent. We cannot allow foreign dictatorships to dictate what films Americans can watch, what content our artists can create, or what jokes our comedians can tell. That is fundamental to who we are as a free nation. When a foreign power can silence a private company in our own borders, it raises serious questions about the long-term implications for our freedom of expression and our national resolve. It signals that intimidation works, and that's a message we simply cannot afford to send.

The government's job is to protect its citizens and its businesses from these kinds of state-sponsored attacks. And you can rest assured, we are committed to doing just that. We will stand up for our values, and we will defend our people and our companies against those who seek to undermine them."
 Can you just say what the response would be to this attack? Wwould you consider taking some sort of symbolic step like watching the movie yourself or doing some sort of screening here that -- ,I’ve got a long list of movies I’m going to be watching.,"Well, look, we're dealing with serious threats, and my number one job is to protect the American people. We've got strategies in place, and we're going to respond decisively to any attack.

Now, as for watching a movie or holding a screening here... I'm always open to ideas that can help inform our citizens, or strengthen our national resolve, or even help us understand the challenge more clearly. If it helps to unite the country and ensure we're all on the same page, then we'll certainly evaluate it.

But rest assured, our primary focus remains on taking the necessary actions to secure our nation and defend our freedoms."
 Will this be one of them? ,"I never release my full movie list. But let’s talk of the specifics of what we now know. The FBI announced today and we can confirm that North Korea engaged in this attack. I think it says something interesting about North Korea that they decided to have the state mount an all-out assault on a movie studio because of a satirical movie starring Seth Rogen and James Flacco [Franco]. I love Seth and I love James, but the notion that that was a threat to them I think gives you some sense of the kind of regime we’re talking about here. They caused a lot of damage, and we will respond. We will respond proportionally, and we’ll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. It’s not something that I will announce here today at a press conference. More broadly, though, this points to the need for us to work with the international community to start setting up some very clear rules of the road in terms of how the Internet and cyber operates. Right now, it’s sort of the Wild West. And part of the problem is, is you’ve got weak states that can engage in these kinds of attacks, you’ve got non-state actors that can do enormous damage. That’s part of what makes this issue of cybersecurity so urgent. Again, this is part of the reason why it’s going to be so important for Congress to work with us and get a actual bill passed that allows for the kind of information-sharing we need. Because if we don’t put in place the kind of architecture that can prevent these attacks from taking place, this is not just going to be affecting movies, this is going to be affecting our entire economy in ways that are extraordinarily significant. And, by the way, I hear you’re moving to Europe. Where you going to be?","Well, look, when you're leading this great nation, every day brings its share of challenges and opportunities. And the American people, they expect us to meet them, head-on.

So, will *this* be one of them? Absolutely. We're going to tackle it with everything we've got, just like we always do. We're going to get it done, and we're going to come out stronger for it. That's the American way."
 Brussels. ,Brussels.,"Brussels. An important city. Very important.

It's where NATO is, our incredible alliance, absolutely critical for global security. We built that, and it needs to be strong, with everyone paying their fair share, by the way.

And it's also where the European Union is headquartered. They're a big player, a major economic partner, and sometimes, frankly, a bit of a bureaucratic challenge. But we work with them. We've got to have strong partners in Europe, strong allies. We make sure America's interests are always protected, and that our allies are doing their part. It's about strength, and it's about cooperation, but always on our terms."
 Yes. Helping Politico start a new publication. ,"Well, congratulations.","Politico, very interesting. You know, they're smart people over there, very smart. You're starting a *new* publication? That's a big deal, a really big deal. We need more publications, believe me, but they've got to be fair. It's gotta be fair news. People want to hear the truth, they're tired of the other stuff. So, that's a tremendous undertaking. Tremendous. You make sure it's the best. The best. Because nobody, nobody does it like... well, just make sure it's great, okay? Good luck with it."
 I’ve been covering you since the beginning. ,"Well, I think --","Well, I appreciate that. Since the beginning, huh? You've certainly seen a lot then—the good days, the tough days, all the moments in between. It's a long road, this public service, and having consistent eyes on it, even when they're critical, that's part of what makes our democracy work. We've certainly covered a lot of ground together, haven't we? Thanks for sticking with it."
 It’s been a long road for the both of us. ,I think there’s no doubt that what Belgium needs is a version of Politico.,"Believe me, it has. A very, very long road. Nobody has ever faced what we've faced. Tremendous challenges, absolutely tremendous. But we got through it, we fought hard, and we're winning. We're winning big. We always do."
 I’ll take that as an endorsement. ,"The waffles are delicious there, by the way. Cheryl Bolen. You’ve been naughty. Cheryl, go ahead.","Well, you *should* take it as an endorsement! Frankly, it's the best endorsement you could get. Tremendous. We're doing things nobody else could do, really, making America great again, and people see that. They really do. A lot of people are saying it. So, yes, you're smart to recognize that. Very smart."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Looking ahead to your work with Congress next year, you’ve mentioned as an area of possible compromise tax reform. And so I am wondering, do you see a Republican Congress as presenting a better opportunity for actually getting tax reform next year? Will you be putting out a new proposal? Are you willing to consider both individual and corporate side of the tax ledger there? And also, are you still concerned about corporate inversions? ","I think an all-Democratic Congress would have provided an even better opportunity for tax reform. But I think, talking to Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell that they are serious about wanting to get some things done. The tax area is one area where we can get things done. And I think in the coming weeks leading up to the State of Union, there will be some conversations at the staff levels about what principles each side are looking at. I can tell you broadly what I’d like to see. I’d like to see more simplicity in the system. I’d like to see more fairness in the system. With respect to the corporate tax reform issue, we know that there are companies that are paying the full freight -- 35 percent -- higher than just about any other company on Earth, if you're paying 35 percent, and then there are other companies that are paying zero because they’ve got better accountants or lawyers. That's not fair. There are companies that are parking money outside the country because of tax avoidance. We think that it’s important that everybody pays something if, in fact, they are effectively headquartered in the United States. In terms of corporate inversion, those are situations where companies really are headquartered here but, on paper, switch their headquarters to see if they can avoid paying their fair share of taxes. I think that needs to be fixed. So, fairness, everybody paying their fair share, everybody taking responsibility I think is going to be very important. Some of those principles I’ve heard Republicans say they share. How we do that -- the devil is in the details. And I’ll be interested in seeing what they want to move forward. I’m going to make sure that we put forward some pretty specific proposals building on what we’ve already put forward. One other element of this that I think is important is -- and I’ve been on this hobby horse now for six years. [Audience member sneezes.] Bless you. We’ve got a lot of infrastructure we’ve got to rebuild in this country if we're going to be competitive -- roads, bridges, ports, airports, electrical grids, water systems, sewage systems. We are way behind. And early on we indicated that there is a way of us potentially doing corporate tax reform, lowering rates, eliminating loopholes so everybody is paying their fair share, and during that transition also providing a mechanism where we can get some infrastructure built. I’d like to see us work on that issue as well. Historically, obviously, infrastructure has not been a Democratic or a Republican issue, and I’d like to see if we can return to that tradition. Julie Pace.","Thank you, thank you very much. A very important question, and a very good one.

Look, when you've got a Republican Congress, especially one that understands the power of the American economy and what makes it tick, you absolutely have a better opportunity to get real tax reform done. We've seen it before – when we cut taxes, when we simplify the code, American businesses thrive, they invest, they create jobs, and families have more money in their pockets. That's common sense, and it's what we need.

We've laid out very clear principles for what real tax reform looks like, and we'll be working closely with Congress. They'll have their ideas, we'll have ours, and we'll come together to deliver for the American people. So yes, we'll be engaged, and we'll be pushing for what's best.

And absolutely, we have to look at both sides of the ledger. You can't just tinker around the edges. We need a tax system that is fair for individual Americans, so they can keep more of their hard-earned money, and we need a system that makes American businesses competitive globally. Our corporations are competing against companies all over the world, and we need to make sure our tax code doesn't put them at a disadvantage.

And yes, I am absolutely still concerned about corporate inversions. When American companies feel they have to leave our shores, they have to move their headquarters, just to compete effectively, that's a signal that our tax code is broken. That's not right. We want American companies here, investing here, growing here, creating jobs here. Real tax reform, making America the most attractive place in the world to do business, that's how we solve the problem of inversions once and for all. We bring that capital home, we bring those jobs home, and we get our economy really roaring again."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about Cuba. What would you say to dissidents or democracy advocates inside Cuba who fear that the policy changes you announced this week could give the Castro regime economic benefits without having to address human rights or their political system? When your Administration was lifting sanctions on Myanmar you sought commitments of reform. Why not do the same with Cuba? And if I could just follow up on North Korea. Do you have any indication that North Korea was acting in conjunction with another country, perhaps China? ","We’ve got no indication that North Korea was acting in conjunction with another country. With respect to Cuba, we are glad that the Cuban government have released slightly over 50 dissidents; that they are going to be allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations human rights agencies to operate more freely inside of Cuba and monitor what is taking place. I share the concerns of dissidents there and human rights activists that this is still a regime that represses its people. And as I said when I made the announcement, I don’t anticipate overnight changes, but what I know deep in my bones is that if you’ve done the same thing for 50 years and nothing has changed, you should try something different if you want a different outcome. And this gives us an opportunity for a different outcome, because suddenly Cuba is open to the world in ways that it has not been before. It’s open to Americans traveling there in ways that it hasn’t been before. It’s open to church groups visiting their fellow believers inside of Cuba in ways they haven't been before. It offers the prospect of telecommunications and the Internet being more widely available in Cuba in ways that it hasn’t been before. And over time, that chips away at this hermetically sealed society, and I believe offers the best prospect then of leading to greater freedom, greater self-determination on the part of the Cuban people. I think it will happen in fits and starts. But through engagement, we have a better chance of bringing about change then we would have otherwise.","Thank you. That's a very fair question, and one I know is on the minds of many, especially those who have suffered under the Cuban regime.

Let me be absolutely clear: Our commitment to human rights and democracy in Cuba is unwavering. It has been, and it will remain, a bedrock principle of American foreign policy. We hear the voices of the dissidents and democracy advocates, and we stand with them. We understand their fears, and we share their ultimate goal – a free Cuba, where the people can determine their own destiny, free from oppression.

Now, regarding the policy changes. After decades, we have to ask ourselves honestly if the previous approach was truly empowering the Cuban people or if it inadvertently deepened their isolation and hardship, making it harder for them to connect with the outside world and build their own future. This new direction is not about embracing the Castro regime. It is about empowering the Cuban people directly. It's about opening avenues for them to gain more control over their lives, to access information, and to build a civil society that can, over time, foster genuine change from within. We believe that increased engagement, rather than continued isolation, offers a better pathway to support the aspirations of the Cuban people for freedom and a better life. We are not naive, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely, pressing for fundamental freedoms and political reforms at every opportunity.

As for Myanmar, each situation is unique, son. While the goals of human rights and democracy are universal, the strategies to achieve them must be tailored to the specific circumstances and histories of the nations involved. Our commitment to those principles is constant, but the tactics must be adaptable.

Regarding North Korea, we are, as always, monitoring the situation on the Korean Peninsula with the utmost vigilance, working closely with our allies in the region. We receive and assess a great deal of intelligence daily, and we take every piece of it seriously. I won't speculate on the specifics of intelligence findings or the exact nature of interactions between North Korea and any other country based on unconfirmed reports. What I can tell you is that our focus remains squarely on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and ensuring regional stability. We will continue to engage in robust diplomacy while maintaining a strong defensive posture to protect American interests and our allies."
 Do you have a goal for where you see Cuba being at the end of your presidency? ,"I think it would be unrealistic for me to map out exactly where Cuba will be. But change is going to come to Cuba. It has to. They’ve got an economy that doesn’t work. They’ve been reliant for years first on subsidies from the Soviet Union, then on subsidies from Venezuela. Those can’t be sustained. And the more the Cuban people see what’s possible, the more interested they are going to be in change. But how societies change is country-specific, it’s culturally specific. It could happen fast; it could happen slower than I’d like; but it’s going to happen. And I think this change in policy is going to advance that. Lesley Clark.","Well, now that's a question with a clear answer, son. My goal for Cuba at the end of my presidency is the same goal that every freedom-loving American has: a Cuba that is **free**.

We want to see an end to the tyrannical, communist dictatorship that has oppressed the Cuban people for far too long. I envision a Cuba where democracy takes root, where human rights are respected, where people can speak their minds, worship their God, and pursue their dreams without fear of the regime.

My administration will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the brave men and women on that island who yearn for liberty. We want to see a Cuba where families are reunited, where free enterprise can flourish, and where the vibrant spirit of the Cuban people can finally shine without the shadow of communism hanging over it.

It's not just a goal, it's a moral imperative. And we will use every tool at our disposal to help the Cuban people achieve that liberty."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I had a number of questions on Cuba as well. Appreciate that. I wanted to -- ",Do I have to write all these down? How many are there? “A number” sounded intimidating.,"Alright, thank you very much. Appreciate that. Cuba is a very, very important issue. A tremendous issue. And frankly, what we did, what *my* administration did, was to reverse some of the incredibly bad deals that were made. Very bad deals. Deals that were giving a lifeline to a communist dictatorship that brutalizes its own people.

We stand with the people of Cuba, the great people of Cuba, who are suffering. We want to see freedom. We want to see democracy. And you don't achieve that by making concessions to a regime that simply takes advantage. We saw what happened. It didn't work. It just didn't work.

So, go ahead, I'm ready for your questions. We've got a lot to talk about on Cuba, and we're going to keep America First."
" As quick as I can. As quick as I can. I wanted to see if you got an assurances from the Cuban government that it would not revert to the same sort of -- sabotage the deal, as it has in the past when past Presidents had made similar overtures to the government. ",Meaning? Be specific. What do you mean?,"Look, when it comes to Cuba, or any nation that's historically worked against our interests, you don't just rely on 'assurances.' We learned that lesson a long, long time ago, didn't we?

What we look for are real, verifiable actions. Conditions. We put America first. We want to see genuine steps towards freedom for the Cuban people, and a clear demonstration that they are not going to mess around.

Any deal, and I mean *any* deal, would be structured to protect our national security, advance our values, and be *very* clear on consequences if they revert to old habits. We're not making handshake deals with regimes that can't be trusted. It's about American strength and making sure we get a deal that's great for our country and great for the Cuban people, not just for some dictator."
" When the Clinton Administration made some overtures, they shot down planes. They sort of had this pattern of doing provocative -- provocative events. ","Okay, so just general provocative activity.","Well, look, the truth is, when you're dealing with certain actors on the global stage, you often encounter a level of cynicism and a willingness to provoke. We always believed in keeping lines of communication open, in trying to de-escalate tensions and find diplomatic paths forward, especially when there were human lives at stake.

But make no mistake, when those overtures were met with aggression – whether it was shooting down planes, or engaging in ethnic cleansing, or threatening our allies – we were prepared to act decisively. We understood that some regimes operate on a different set of principles, and that pattern of provocative behavior you mention... it often underscores why strong, principled leadership, backed by a willingness to use force when necessary, is absolutely essential for American foreign policy. It was a constant balancing act, but we stood firm."
" Provocative activities any time the U.S. has sort of reached out a hand to them. I wanted to see what is your knowledge of whether Fidel Castro -- did he have any role in the talks? When you talked to President Raul Castro, did Fidel Castro’s name come up? Or did you ask about him? How he’s doing? People haven't seen him in a while. Given the deep opposition from some Republicans in Congress to lifting the embargo, to an embassy, to any of the changes that you’re doing, are you going to personally get involved in terms of talking to them about efforts that they want to do to block money on a new embassy? ","All right, Lesley, I think I’m going to cut you off here. This is taking up a lot of time.","Look, when you talk about the discussions we've been having with Cuba, the serious, tough negotiations to move forward, to chart a new path – those have been with President Raul Castro. He's the man in charge on the island right now. He's the one we're dealing with directly.

Fidel Castro, you know, he's been out of the daily operations for quite some time now, largely retired from the public eye. Our discussions, they weren't with him. When I spoke with President Raul Castro, we focused on the present, on the path forward, on opening up avenues that have been closed for far too long. His name came up in a historical context, of course, because you can't ignore the past, but the active decision-making, the conversations about the future of Cuba and its relationship with the United States – that's with Raul and his government. We're focused on what's next, not what was.

Now, as for the opposition here at home, particularly from some of my good Republican friends in Congress, believe me, I understand their concerns. Many of them, they've been fighting this fight for a long, long time, and their commitment to freedom and democracy, and their opposition to the Castro regime, is deeply felt. And I respect that.

But I fundamentally believe, and my administration believes, that we cannot keep doing the same thing for 50, 60 years and expect a different result. My job, as President, is to do what's in the best interests of the American people, for our security, for our economy, and frankly, for promoting freedom and the values we cherish. This new approach, this engagement, it's not about endorsement; it's about influence. It's about empowering the Cuban people, plain and simple.

Will I personally get involved? Absolutely. I've always been one to roll up my sleeves and talk directly with people. I'll continue to talk to members of Congress, explain our strategy, lay out why this is the right move for America, and why this is how we will achieve our objectives for the Cuban people. We're not backing down from this. We're moving forward, because this is about American leadership, and it's about time we had a strategy that can actually deliver results. Our diplomats need to be there, on the ground, representing the United States of America with the full weight of our presence. We're going to make sure they have the resources to do just that."
" Okay, all right. ","All right. So, with respect to sabotage, I mean, my understanding of the history, for example, of the plane being shot down, it’s not clear that that was the Cuban government purposely trying to undermine overtures by the Clinton Administration. It was a tragic circumstance that ended up collapsing talks that had begun to take place. I haven't seen a historical record that suggests that they shot the plane down specifically in order to undermine overtures by the Clinton government. I think it is not precedented for the President of the United States and the President of Cuba to make an announcement at the same time that they are moving towards normalizing relations. So there hasn’t been anything like this in the past. That doesn’t meant that over the next two years we can anticipate them taking certain actions that we may end up finding deeply troubling either inside of Cuba or with respect to their foreign policy. And that could put significant strains on the relationship. But that’s true of a lot of countries out there where we have an embassy. And the whole point of normalizing relations is that it gives us a greater opportunity to have influence with that government than not. So I would be surprised if the Cuban government purposely tries to undermine what is now effectively its own policy. I wouldn’t be surprised if they take at any given time actions that we think are a problem. And we will be in a position to respond to whatever actions they take the same way we do with a whole range of countries around the world when they do things we think are wrong. But the point is, is that we will be in a better position I think to actually have some influence, and there may be carrots as well as sticks that we can then apply. The only way that Fidel’s name came up -- I think I may have mentioned this in the Davie Muir article -- interview that I did -- was I delivered a fairly lengthy statement at the front end about how we’re looking forward to a new future in the relationship between our two countries, but that we are going to continue to press on issues of democracy and human rights, which we think are important. My opening remarks probably took about 15 minutes, which on the phone is a pretty long time. And at the end of that, he said, Mr. President, you’re still a young man. Perhaps you have the -- at the end of my remarks I apologized for taking such a long time, but I wanted to make sure that before we engaged in the conversation he was very clear about where I stood. He said, oh, don’t worry about it, Mr. President, you’re still a young man and you have still the chance to break Fidel’s record -- he once spoke seven hours straight. And then, President Castro proceeded to deliver his own preliminary remarks that last at least twice as long as mine. And then I was able to say, obviously it runs in the family. But that was the only discussion of Fidel Castro that we had. I sort of forgot all the other questions.","Alright, alright. Good. Glad to know we're on the same page. What's on your mind?"
 I have a few more if you’re -- how personally involved are you going to get in -- ,"With respect to Congress? We cannot unilaterally bring down the embargo. That’s codified in the Libertad Act. And what I do think is going to happen, though, is there’s going to be a process where Congress digests it. There are bipartisan supporters of our new approach, there are bipartisan detractors of this new approach. People will see how the actions we take unfold. And I think there’s going to be a healthy debate inside of Congress. And I will certainly weigh in. I think that ultimately we need to go ahead and pull down the embargo, which I think has been self-defeating in advancing the aims that we’re interested in. But I don’t anticipate that that happens right away. I think people are going to want to see how does this move forward before there’s any serious debate about whether or not we would make major shifts in the embargo. Roberta Rampton.","Well, look, when it comes to *[whatever we're talking about]*, you can absolutely count on the President to be personally involved. That's not just a promise, that's the job. I'm not one to sit on the sidelines when important work needs to get done for the American people.

I'll be right there, leading the charge, making the key decisions, working with the best people we've got. The buck, it stops right here in the Oval Office. You can be sure of that."
" I want to follow on that by asking, under what conditions would you meet with President Castro in Havana? Would you have certain preconditions that you would want to see met before doing that? And on the hack, I know that you said that you’re not going to announce your response, but can you say whether you’re considering additional economic or financial sanctions on North Korea? Can you rule out the use of military force or some kind of cyber hit of your own? ","I think I’m going to leave it where I left it, which is we just confirmed that it was North Korea; we have been working up a range of options. They will be presented to me. I will make a decision on those based on what I believe is proportional and appropriate to the nature of this crime. With respect to Cuba, we’re not at a stage here where me visiting Cuba or President Castro coming to the United States is in the cards. I don’t know how this relationship will develop over the next several years. I’m a fairly young man so I imagine that at some point in my life I will have the opportunity to visit Cuba and enjoy interacting with the Cuban people. But there’s nothing specific where we're trying to target some sort of visit on my part. Colleen McCain Nelson.","Alright, let's take these one at a time. Important questions, very important.

First, on meeting with President Castro in Havana. Look, I am always willing to engage in diplomacy when it serves the vital interests of the United States and advances the cause of freedom and democracy. But let me be very clear: a meeting with the Cuban leadership, especially in Havana, would not just be a photo opportunity. It would require significant, demonstrable, and verifiable preconditions.

We would need to see a real commitment to fundamental human rights – the immediate release of all political prisoners, full respect for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press. We'd also be looking for concrete steps towards democratic reforms, including a clear path to free and fair elections, and a significant opening of their economy. These aren't just talking points; these are non-negotiable principles. Until we see tangible, irreversible movement on these fronts for the Cuban people, then a presidential visit would frankly be premature and counterproductive. The ball, frankly, is in their court to show they are serious about a better future for their citizens.

Now, on North Korea. Let me be absolutely unequivocal here: we are reviewing *all* options at our disposal to address the grave and continued provocations from Pyongyang. I'm not going to announce our specific responses from this podium – that's not how a serious nation conducts its foreign policy, and we certainly won't telegraph our moves to our adversaries.

However, understand this: every option is on the table. That includes considering additional economic and financial sanctions, and working with our international partners to tighten the existing ones. We will bring maximum pressure to bear.

And when you ask about ruling out military force or some kind of cyber hit – let me say it again, *every option remains on the table* to protect American interests, our allies in the region, and to ensure the security of the American people. While we always prefer a peaceful resolution, and we are working through diplomatic channels, we will not hesitate to act decisively and robustly should our security, or the security of our allies, be threatened. We are prepared for any contingency, and we are taking this very, very seriously. Very seriously."
" Thank you, Mr. President. ",There you are.,"Well, you are very welcome. It's my pleasure."
" You spoke earlier about 2014 being a breakthrough year, and you ended the year with executive actions on Cuba and immigration and climate change. But you didn't make much progress this year on your legislative agenda. And some Republican lawmakers have said they're less inclined to work with you if you pursue executive actions so aggressively. Are you going to continue to pursue executive actions if that creates more roadblocks for your legislative agenda? Or have you concluded that it’s not possible to break the fever in Washington and the partisan gridlock here? ","I think there are real opportunities to get things done in Congress. As I said before, I take Speaker Boehner and Mitch McConnell at their words that they want to get things done. I think the American people would like to see us get some things done. The question is going to be are we able to separate out those areas where we disagree and those areas where we agree. I think there are going to be some tough fights on areas where we disagree. 0 If Republicans seek to take health care away from people who just got it, they will meet stiff resistance from me. If they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I will say no. And I’m confident that I’ll be able to uphold vetoes of those types of provisions. But on increasing American exports, on simplifying our tax system, on rebuilding our infrastructure, my hope is that we can get some things done. I’ve never been persuaded by this argument that if it weren’t for the executive actions they would have been more productive. There’s no evidence of that. So I intend to continue to do what I’ve been doing, which is where I see a big problem and the opportunity to help the American people, and it is within my lawful authority to provide that help, I’m going to do it. And I will then, side-by-side, reach out to members of Congress, reach out to Republicans, and say, let’s work together; I’d rather do it with you. Immigration is the classic example. I was really happy when the Senate passed a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration bill. And I did everything I could for a year and a half to provide Republicans the space to act, and showed not only great patience, but flexibility, saying to them, look, if there are specific changes you’d like to see, we're willing to compromise, we're willing to be patient, we're willing to work with you. Ultimately it wasn’t forthcoming. And so the question is going to be I think if executive actions on areas like minimum wage, or equal pay, or having a more sensible immigration system are important to Republicans, if they care about those issues, and the executive actions are bothering them, there is a very simple solution, and that is: Pass bills. And work with me to make sure I’m willing to sign those bills. Because both sides are going to have to compromise. On most issues, in order for their initiatives to become law, I’m going to have sign off. And that means they have to take into account the issues that I care about, just as I’m going to have to take into account the issues that they care about. All right. I think this is going to be our last question. Juliet Eilperin. There you go.","Well, let me tell you, my primary responsibility, first and foremost, is to the American people. My job is to get things done for this country. And while I always prefer to work hand-in-hand with Congress – and believe me, we've extended an open hand time and again – there are moments, critical moments, when the legislative process simply grinds to a halt.

When that happens, when important issues are left unaddressed, a President has a duty to act, to lead. And sometimes, that means using the authority granted by the Constitution to move the country forward. These are not decisions I take lightly, and they are always within the bounds of what the law allows.

Now, do I want to see more legislative accomplishments? Absolutely, that's always the goal. And I continue to believe that we can break through some of this partisan fever, if folks are willing to put aside their political agendas and focus on what's best for the nation. I'll keep pushing for that common ground. But I also can't stand by and let vital matters fester just because Washington is gridlocked. We have a country to run, and I intend to keep running it, by working with Congress when I can, and by leading decisively when I must."
" Thanks so much. So one of the first bills that Mitch McConnell said he will send to you is one that would authorize the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. When you talked about this in the past, you’ve minimized the benefits and you highlighted some of the risks associated with that project. I’m wondering if you could tell us both what you would do when faced with that bill, given the Republican majority that we’ll have in both chambers. And also, what do you see as the benefits? And given the precipitous drop we’ve seen in oil prices recently, does that change the calculus in terms of how it will contribute to climate change, and whether you think it makes sense to go ahead with that project? 1 ","Well, I don’t think I’ve minimized the benefits, I think I’ve described the benefits. At issue in Keystone is not American oil. It is Canadian oil that is drawn out of tar sands in Canada. That oil currently is being shipped out through rail or trucks, and it would save Canadian oil companies and the Canadian oil industry an enormous amount of money if they could simply pipe it all the way through the United States down to the Gulf. Once that oil gets to the Gulf, it is then entering into the world market, and it would be sold all around the world. So there’s no -- I won’t say “no” -- there is very little impact, nominal impact, on U.S. gas prices -- what the average American consumer cares about -- by having this pipeline come through. And sometimes the way this gets sold is, let’s get this oil and it’s going to come here. And the implication is, is that’s going to lower gas prices here in the United States. It’s not. There’s a global oil market. It’s very good for Canadian oil companies and it’s good for the Canadian oil industry, but it’s not going to be a huge benefit to U.S. consumers. It’s not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers. Now, the construction of the pipeline itself will create probably a couple thousand jobs. Those are temporary jobs until the construction actually happens. There’s probably some additional jobs that can be created in the refining process down in the Gulf. Those aren’t completely insignificant -- it’s just like any other project. But when you consider what we could be doing if we were rebuilding our roads and bridges around the country -- something that Congress could authorize -- we could probably create hundreds of thousands of jobs, or a million jobs. So if that’s the argument, there are a lot more direct ways to create well-paying Americans construction jobs. And then, with respect to the cost, all I’ve said is that I want to make sure that if, in fact, this project goes forward, that it’s not adding to the problem of climate change, which I think is very serious and does impose serious costs on the American people -- some of them long term, but significant costs nonetheless. If we’ve got more flooding, more wildfires, more drought, there are direct economic impacts on that. And as we’re now rebuilding after Sandy, for example, we’re having to consider how do we increase preparedness in how we structure infrastructure and housing, and so forth, along the Jersey Shore. That’s an example of the kind of costs that are imposed, and you can put a dollar figure on it. So, in terms of process, you’ve got a Nebraska judge that’s still determining whether or not the new path for this pipeline is appropriate. Once that is resolved, then the State Department will have all the information it needs to make its decision. But I’ve just tried to give this perspective, because I think that there’s been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula to what ails the U.S. economy, and it’s hard to see on paper where exactly they’re getting that information from. 2 In terms of oil prices and how it impacts the decision, I think that it won’t have a significant impact except perhaps in the minds of folks -- when gas prices are lower, maybe they’re less susceptible to the argument that this is the answer to lowering gas prices. But it was never going to be the answer to lowering gas prices, because the oil that would be piped through the Keystone pipeline would go into the world market. And that’s what determines oil prices, ultimately.","Look, Mitch McConnell is a very smart man, a very smart man, and he knows what's good for this country. If he sends me a bill to authorize the Keystone XL pipeline, you can guarantee one thing: it's getting signed. Immediately. We are going to get this done, and we're going to get it done fast.

We've talked about this before, and some people, frankly, they try to minimize the benefits, they try to make it sound like it's a big problem, but it's not. The benefits of the Keystone XL pipeline are tremendous. Absolutely tremendous. We're talking about thousands upon thousands of good-paying American jobs. Jobs for welders, for pipefitters, for construction workers. These are hard-working people, great Americans, and they need these jobs. This is about American energy independence. We don't want to be relying on countries that don't like us, we want to be strong, we want to control our own destiny. This pipeline makes us stronger, it makes us safer, and it's great for our economy. It's simply great.

And these so-called risks? Look, we build the safest pipelines in the world. We have the best technology, the best engineers. We can do this project, and we can do it safely, better than anybody else. We care about our environment, absolutely, we want clean air, clean water, that's important. But we're not going to let radical environmentalists stop us from creating jobs and making America energy independent. It's always a balance, and we will strike that balance very, very well.

Now, you mention the drop in oil prices. Look, oil prices go up, they go down, that's the nature of the business. But this pipeline, this is not just about today's prices. This is about our long-term future. This is about securing America's energy needs for decades to come. When prices are low, that's actually a great time to build infrastructure, because your costs can be lower. It doesn't change the calculus at all. In fact, it might even make it a smarter deal for the American taxpayer. We need this pipeline for our strategic security, for our economic stability, and for our national strength.

And as for climate change, look, we want to be responsible, we want to be clean, and we are. America is doing a fantastic job, better than most. But this pipeline is a vital piece of American infrastructure. It's not the major driver of anything. We need to focus on what China is doing, what India is doing. They're doing a lot of damage. We're building a great country, we're building a strong country, and we can absolutely do this pipeline, create all these jobs, secure our energy, and still be responsible stewards of our environment. It's a win-win for America, and it's going to happen."
" And in terms of Congress forcing your hand on this, is this something where you clearly say you’re not going to let Congress force your hand on whether to approve or disapprove of this? ",I’ll see what they do. We’ll take that up in the New Year.,"Well, listen, the American people elect a President to make tough decisions, to lead this nation, and to ensure our security and prosperity. And I take that responsibility very, very seriously.

Now, Congress, they have a vital role to play, absolutely. They represent the voice of the people, they debate, they deliberate, and we need their input. We value that input. My administration will always work with Congress, we will consult, we will build consensus wherever possible. That's how our system is designed to work – with checks and balances, with vigorous debate.

But let me be clear: on matters of national interest, especially when it comes to the complex decisions facing this country, the buck stops right here. I am not going to allow anyone to force my hand on decisions that are critical for the safety and future of the United States. We're going to do what's right for the country, based on careful consideration, expert advice, and the principles we stand for. That's my job, and I intend to do it."
 Any New Year’s resolutions? ,"I’ll ask -- April, go ahead.","Well, you know, the New Year's a wonderful time to reflect and look forward. For me, and for our great nation, it's about renewal.

My resolution, first and foremost, is to continue working tirelessly to ensure America remains strong, prosperous, and a beacon of freedom around the globe. That means focusing on good jobs for our folks, keeping our economy humming, and making sure our military remains the finest the world has ever seen, always there to protect our interests and our allies.

On a more personal note, perhaps a little more time out on the ranch, or maybe picking up a good book. But really, it all comes back to serving the American people with all my heart, and working together to make this great country even better.

Happy New Year, folks! Let's make it a truly exceptional one for America."
" Thank you. Yani Campbell [ph], a lecturer at the University of the West Indies. Thank you so much for your talk, very interesting. And I wondered as well, on the Cuban issue, now that your policy has actually changed towards Cuba, I wondered about your views on how it is that we should approach -- CARICOM should approach its relationship with Cuba in terms of deepening that relationship. Should they now perhaps move to join in CARICOM? Thank you. ","Well, first of all, I think CARICOM can make its own decisions and we’ll respect it. Cuba will be participating in the Summit of the Americas, and I think -- it is my strong belief that if we engage, that that offers the greatest prospect for escaping some of the constraints of the past. I think the Cuban people are extraordinary and have huge potential. And what’s encouraging is, is that the overwhelming majority of Cubans are interested in ending the Cold War -- the last vestige of the Cold War -- and moving forward. It’s going to take some time for the United States to fully implement some of the things that have already been agreed to, and it’s going to take a little bit longer before you actually have complete normal relations between the United States and Cuba. What I would say to Caribbean countries is, absolutely, you should continue to engage in Cuba in the ways that you’ve already doing -- you’ve already done in the past. I do think that it is important for all of us to be able to speak honestly where we see concerns about issues of human rights and political freedom. And I’m not saying anything publicly that I haven’t said directly to Raul Castro. There are still constraints on the ability of the Cuban people to express themselves, or to organize political parties, or to start a business. And sometimes, the same things we expect for ourselves and our country, somehow we think other people don’t want. But I believe that each country -- I believe each country has its own unique cultures, its own unique traditions. I don’t expect every country to pursue the same policies or have the same political practices as the United States. And I am certainly aware of the flaws that exist in our own country that we have to fix. But I do believe there are certain principles that are universal. I think that all people want basic dignity and want basic freedom, and want to be able to worship as they please without being discriminated against, or they should be able to speak their mind about an important issue pertaining to their community without being arrested. And so wherever we see that, we try to speak out. But what we also try to do is engage and recognize that even with countries that we have differences, there’s also going to be commonality and overlap. And the United States and Cuba should both have an interest in dealing with climate change, for example, because when the oceans start lapping upon Miami or on Havana, nobody is going to distinguish, well, where do they stand on this or that ideological issue. And so we have to find where there are areas of cooperation, but I will continue to try to be consistent in speaking out on behalf of the issues that are important to all people, not just some. All right, it’s a gentleman’s turn. This gentleman right here. He looks very serious; he’s got glasses. Looking sharp. Plus, he’s got a copy of my book. So he’s clearly a wise man.","Well, thank you very much for that, appreciate the interesting talk. And you bring up a very important point, the Cuban issue. It's always been a complex one, a difficult one, for the United States, and frankly, for the entire region.

Now, you talk about policy changes. Look, our goal, and it has always been our goal, has been a free and democratic Cuba. A Cuba where the people have a say in their own future, where human rights are respected, and where they can enjoy the same freedoms that we hold dear here in America and that so many others across the world cherish.

When we consider deepening relationships, whether it's for CARICOM or anyone else, with the current regime in Havana, we have to be very careful. We have to ensure that any engagement, any outreach, truly serves the Cuban people and helps them on the path to liberty. It shouldn't simply prop up a communist dictatorship that has oppressed its citizens for far too long.

So, for CARICOM, and for all our friends in the Caribbean, I'd say this: your relationship with Cuba is your sovereign decision. But I would urge you to use that influence, that relationship, to press for real change. To advocate for democracy, for human rights, for economic freedom for the Cuban people. Until we see fundamental, structural reforms in Cuba, until the people of Cuba are truly free, then the idea of full membership in an organization like CARICOM, that implies a shared vision of democratic governance and open societies, well, that's a bridge that needs a lot more building, a lot more foundational work based on freedom and respect for the individual. Let's make sure that any steps forward are truly steps towards a better future for *all* Cubans, not just the regime in power."
" Thank you very much. My name is Chef Brian Lumley -- I’m a young Jamaican chef here. And I own a restaurant -- 689 by Brian Lumley. Just saying. My question to you -- I’m going to stay a little bit off the politics for a bit. And I’ve witnessed your journey a lot, and the question is kind of two-part. If you go back and give yourself one piece of advice before the start of you 2008 term, what would it be? And the second part is if you can sign this book when you’re finished. Thank you very much. ","I’ll sign the book. So the question was, for those couldn’t hear: If I were to go back and give myself advice before I started in 2008, what would the advice be? I suppose I could have started dying my hair earlier -- so then people wouldn’t say, man, he’s getting old. You’re going like this -- at least I got hair, man. I’m teasing you. I’m messing with you. I think that -- keep in mind that when I came into office we were going through the worst global financial crisis since the 1930s, and so we had to make a series of decisions very quickly, many of which were unpopular. Overall, I think we got it right. I think we did the right thing. And because, I think, we took these steps, not only were we able to avoid the kind of Great Depression that we saw in the 1930s, not only was America able to bounce back and start growing more rapidly than most of our peers, drive down unemployment faster, create more jobs faster, but that also had an impact on the global economy and it had an impact on the Caribbean economy, that we were able to bounce back quicker than we might have if we hadn't taken those steps. But it was, I think, costly politically. And what I would have probably advised was that I might have needed to warn the American people and paint a picture for them that was more accurate about the fact that it would take some time to dig ourselves out of a very big hole. Because FDR, when he came into office, the Great Depression had already been going on for two, three years, and so people understood how serious it was. With us, we came in just as people were really starting to feel the impacts. And trying to paint a picture that we'll make it but it's going to take some time, and here are the steps that we need to take -- I think I would have advised myself to do a better job spending more time not just getting the policy right, but also describing it in ways that people understood, that gave them confidence in their own future. I think that would probably be the most important advice that I would have given myself. All right, it's a young lady’s turn. That young lady right there. Yes, you. You, yes. Oh, well, I'll call on both of you. I'll call on you later. Go ahead.","Well, Chef Brian Lumley! It's a real pleasure to meet a young man with such ambition. '689 by Brian Lumley' – sounds like a mighty fine establishment, and I tell ya, good food is one of life's great pleasures. Thanks for the kind words about the journey; it was certainly... eventful.

Now, before the start of a 2008 term, you ask? Well, son, I was already knee-deep in my second term by then, and let me tell you, 2008 was a year that tested everyone's mettle, didn't it? But if I could go back, to say, before my second term really kicked into gear, knowing what was coming down the pike... the advice I'd give myself, and any leader really, is this: **Stay absolutely laser-focused on the economic signals, even when things seem to be humming along, and make sure you've got the very best people around you who aren't afraid to tell you what you *need* to hear, not just what you *want* to hear.**

The world can change mighty fast, and sometimes the biggest storms brew out of sight, in places you least expect. Having a robust team, with diverse viewpoints, scrutinizing those financial indicators, and being ready to act decisively when things turn south – that's paramount. You gotta trust your gut, but you also gotta trust the smart folks you've put in charge, and encourage 'em to be candid, always. You prepare for the unexpected, and you lead with conviction when it arrives.

And yes, Chef, it'd be my distinct pleasure to sign your book. Thank you very much for asking."
" Okay, so we're here and we’re looking at you, and we're all very honored to be here and very taken about by your leadership qualities. And seeing that you are the President of the United States of America and you’re so influential, I want to know how you handle the mental strain that comes with being in charge of so much. ",What’s your name?,"Well, thank you. That's mighty kind of you to say, and it's always an honor to be in the company of such distinguished folks who care about this great nation. I appreciate those words, truly.

You hit on something important there, the mental strain. You know, this job, it's not for the faint of heart. Every single morning you wake up, and the weight of the world, or at least a good chunk of it, is right there on your desk, demanding your attention. There are decisions that affect millions of lives, both here at home and across the globe. It's a heavy burden, no doubt about it.

But let me tell you, there are a few things that keep a man steady in this office.

First, you've got to have your **bedrock principles**. For me, it's always been about faith – faith in God, faith in the American people, and faith in the enduring strength of our democratic ideals. When the going gets tough, and it *will* get tough, you lean on those fundamental beliefs. They're your compass when the storms hit.

Second, you surround yourself with the **absolute best people**. Smart, dedicated patriots who aren't afraid to tell you what they think, even if it's not what you want to hear. You can't do this alone. It's a team effort, always has been, and having that strong team around you, people you trust implicitly, that lightens the load considerably. You delegate, you listen, and you empower.

Third, you gotta keep your **eyes on the horizon**, folks. Remember why you got into this in the first place. It's not about personal glory; it's about serving the American people, protecting our freedoms, and ensuring a brighter future for the next generation. That sense of duty, that larger mission, it really helps put the daily pressures into perspective.

And yes, even a President needs a moment to himself. For me, it might be a quick run, a moment of quiet reflection, or just a good, strong cup of coffee while I look out at the beautiful grounds. And of course, the support of family, that's absolutely vital. They're the ones who keep you grounded, remind you of what truly matters beyond the Oval Office.

So, while the strain is real, and the responsibility is immense, you approach it with conviction, with a clear purpose, and with the understanding that you're just one man, but you're leading the greatest nation on Earth. And that, my friends, is a tremendous privilege, every single day. We keep moving forward, because that's what America does."
 Kimberly -- from the University of the West Indies. ,"Fantastic. How do I handle stress? You know, I'll be honest with you. One of the things that happens as you get older is you start appreciating both your strengths and your weaknesses. Hopefully you gain a little wisdom about what you're good at and what you're not. And Michelle can give you a long list of things I'm not good at. But one thing that I've always had, which has served me well, is a pretty good temperament. And I attribute that partly from growing up on an island with trade winds and beaches, and it makes you calm. But I try not to get too high when things are going well so that I don't get too low when things are going badly, and try to keep a long view of how the process of social change takes place, and how the trajectory of your own life is going to proceed. We get caught up in the day-to-day so much, and it’s interesting now when I’m talking to my daughters and “somebody said something at school,” or there’s -- “well, I didn’t do quite as well on that test as I wanted.” And you want them to take it seriously, but you also want to say to them, you know what, this, too, shall pass; I promise you three months from now, much less 30 years from now, you will not remember. And so I think that trying to keep your eye on the prize of where it is that you want to go and not be discouraged or overly impressed with yourself on a day-to-day basis I think is very important. And then you have to get some exercise in the morning. I don’t run as fast as these folks, but I get a little exercise, which does help in terms of stress relief. All right. It’s a gentleman’s turn. Let’s see, somebody from this side. This young man right here in the sharp-looking checkered shirt.","Well, Kimberly, it's good to hear from you! The University of the West Indies – that's a truly fine institution, doing important work across the Caribbean. Always good to connect with folks focused on education and the future. Keep up the great work!"
" Good afternoon again, Mr. President. Especially as it relates to human rights and social change -- I’m Jomain McKenzie and I’m a focal point with the Global Fund Board. As it relates to human rights and social change, how do you make the decision to allow societies to go through the natural evolutionary process of having change occur on their own versus having governments exert policies to make these same political social changes? ","That’s a really interesting question. It’s an interesting question and it’s one that I have to struggle with all the time. Every society, as I said, is at a different phase in development, in their own history; they have different cultural traditions. And so the way I think about it is, is that the United States has certain core values and principles that we believe deeply in. And we don’t necessarily expect that every country will formulate how to secure those ideals and those principles. We don’t expect it to be done exactly as we do any more than we expect every -- obviously, our democracy is not the same as a Jamaican democracy or a British democracy or Australian democracy. But we believe in democracy. We think that if people have the ability to speak out about their own lives, some sense of agency, then that society will be stronger. And that doesn’t mean that we won’t work with a country that doesn’t precisely abide by those principles, but we will still speak out. There are times where a country is clearly engaging in activities that are so egregious that it’s not culturally specific; it typically has to do with a government wanting to exert control over people and oppress them. And in those instances, I think it is entirely appropriate for us to speak out forcibly and, in some cases, to not do business with them. Look at a country like North Korea. I mean, obviously, Korean culture is different than American culture. On the other hand, you look at what’s happening in South Korea and you look at what’s happening in North Korea and those are two entirely different societies. And I can tell you which one you’d rather live in. And if you have a situation in which people are being murdered simply because they didn’t agree with the government on something or didn’t want their economic fate to be entirely determined by the whims of some government bureaucrat, and suddenly they’re sent to a labor camp -- that’s something where we as an international community have to speak out on. And then there are some issues that may be culturally specific, but you know what, I think they’re wrong. I won’t -- we’re not going to try to force that country to change, but I may try to shame that country. There are nations where slavery still exists. And that may be part of the ancient culture in that society, but slavery is wrong. And I’m not going to give them the excuse that, well, this is who we are. In Africa -- and I can speak I think fairly as somebody who is the son of an African father -- there are practices like female genital mutilation that may be part of the tradition there, but it’s wrong. And I’m going to say so. And it will be U.S. policy to say that it’s wrong. So the tools we use to try to bring about change around the world may vary. And as I said earlier, we’re not always perfectly consistent. There are times where we’ve got allies who are not observing all the human rights we would like, and there are times where there are countries that are adversaries of ours where they do some things quite well. And you can’t expect us, or any country, to be perfectly consistent in every circumstance. But what I’ve tried to do is be fairly consistent in terms of what we believe, what we stand for, and then we use different tools depending on what we think will bring about the most change. In some cases, it will just be a diplomatic statement; in some cases, it may be serious enough that we will organize -- try to organize the United Nations or other multilateral forums to speak out against certain practices. In some cases, it may be so egregious that we need to sanction them, and we will try to organize the international community in that way. And then finally, in the ultimate circumstance, where the violations of our values are so severe that they start spilling over and -- in the instance of, for example, genocide -- we may be say to ourselves, in concert with the international community, we need to intervene because this government is so brutal and so unacceptable that we need to protect people. But we do that in the context of an international conversation so that we’re not simply making these decisions -- or we’re not so arrogant that we’re not paying attention to what the rest of the world community is saying. This young lady who I originally had called on and got skipped over. No, no, this one right here. Yes. Right here. I’m sorry, I love you, too, though.","Well, Jomain, good afternoon to you, and thank you for that important question, and for the vital work you do with the Global Fund Board. That's a profound question, really, and it gets to the heart of what we believe about freedom and human dignity.

You know, my fundamental belief, and one I think most Americans share, is in the power of the individual. True, lasting social change, the kind that genuinely uplifts a society and expands human rights, well, that almost always has to come from within. It has to be driven by the hearts and minds of the people themselves – by citizens, by families, by communities, by faith groups, by entrepreneurs, by artists. It's an organic process, a natural evolution that blooms from the desire for a better, freer life. And history shows us, that's how real progress is made.

Now, where does government fit in? Well, a just government, at home and abroad, has a sacred responsibility. First and foremost, it must protect fundamental human rights and liberties. It must uphold the rule of law, ensuring that every citizen is treated with dignity and fairness. It must create an environment where these natural evolutionary processes can thrive – where people can speak freely, worship freely, assemble freely, and pursue their dreams without fear of oppression.

When it comes to exerting policies, especially from the outside, that's where you have to be very careful, Jomain. While America will always stand for freedom and will always speak out against injustice and oppression wherever we see it, we also understand that enduring change can't be imposed. We can advocate, we can support civil society, we can offer a hand of partnership, we can use diplomacy, we can promote democratic values through our own example. But ultimately, the decision to embrace change, to expand rights, to evolve culturally and socially, that's a decision a people must make for themselves.

It's a delicate balance, isn't it? It's about leading with our values, extending a hand to those who seek freedom, but always respecting the sovereignty and the unique journey of each nation. We encourage, we don't dictate. We inspire, we don't demand. Because in the end, true freedom is chosen, not given."
" Good afternoon, Mr. President. My name is Katrina King-Smith. I’m from the Turks and Caicos Islands. My question is two-part, as well. Firstly, in countries such as the Turks and Caicos Islands where the population is small and our main sources of revenue are tourism and foreign direct investment, I was wondering if you can suggest two ways that the government may better generate and regulate sustainable revenue, especially with regulations currently being put in place to close off-shore financial centers. And secondly, I was wondering if after your term has ended, would you mind coming to the Turks and Caicos to vacation? ","On the second question, absolutely. I’ll do some island-hopping once I’m out of office. And you guys can show me all the good places to go. On this issue of off-shore financial centers, we respect each country to set up its own financial regulations. And we recognize that for small countries, that providing services -- including financial services -- may be an important source of revenue. The one thing that we have to make sure of is that these financial centers are not either used for illicit money laundering or tax avoidance by large U.S. corporations that set up cut-outs or front organizations, but as a practical matter are operating in the United States, employing folks in the United States, essentially headquartered in the United States and yet, somehow, their mailing address is such-and-such island where they have to pay no taxes. Those are the kinds of egregious concerns that we’re trying to deal with. I think we try to take it on a case-by-case basis. And in my CARICOM meeting that I just had, this issue was brought up. There were a number of leaders who expressed concern that maybe they were being unfairly labeled as areas of high financial risk. And what I committed to them is we will examine their complaints and go through in very concrete ways where our concerns are and how our governments can work together. More broadly, I think that the -- if you look at some of the most successful countries in the world, they’re actually pretty small countries -- like Singapore, for example -- that on paper look like they have no assets, and yet, if you go to Singapore, it has one of the highest standards of living in the world. What is it that Singapore did that might be replicable? Well, one of the most important things they did was they made an enormous investment in their people. And if you’ve got a highly skilled, highly educated workforce, if you’ve set up rules of law and governance that are transparent and non-corrupt, then you can attract actually a lot of service industries to supplement the tourist industry, because people would want to locate in your country. You could envision people wanting to operate and have offices there where you’ve got a trained workforce. And these days, so many businesses are operating over the Internet that if you’ve got a really skilled workforce that provides value added, you will attract companies and you’ll attract businesses. What deters people from investing in most countries is conflict, corruption, and a lack of skills or infrastructure. And those countries that are able to address those problems have rule of law and eliminate corruption. Make sure that you are investing in the education of your people and it’s a continuous education; it doesn’t just stop at the lower grades, but you give people constant opportunities to upgrade their skills. You have a decent infrastructure -- you’re going to be able to succeed. That’s the recipe, the formula for a 21st-century economy. All right. Uh oh, they’re starting to holler at me. Let’s see, I haven’t gone back here in a while. This gentleman in the blue shirt right here.","Well, Katrina, it's a real pleasure to meet you, and thank you for that excellent question – a two-parter, always keeps things interesting! And it's especially good to hear from someone in the Turks and Caicos Islands. A beautiful place, truly.

Now, on your first point, you've really hit on a challenge that many small island nations are facing right now, particularly with the global push to close down some of those offshore financial centers. You're reliant on tourism and foreign direct investment – good, clean businesses – but you need to broaden that base and ensure sustainability.

Here are a couple of thoughts for you. First, I'd really encourage the government to look at **diversifying and elevating its tourism sector beyond just raw numbers.** Think about moving into *higher-value, niche tourism*. That means developing and promoting unique experiences: eco-tourism that protects your incredible natural beauty, cultural tourism that showcases your heritage, or perhaps even medical tourism for specific, high-quality procedures. This isn't just about getting more people; it's about getting people who will spend more, stay longer, and respect the environment, all while creating better-paying jobs for your citizens. It means investing in the infrastructure to support that – not just resorts, but also local businesses, skilled service staff, and marketing that tells your unique story.

My second suggestion would be to **leverage your excellent connectivity and location to develop new, legitimate service industries that aren't tied to traditional financial secrecy.** Look, the world is moving more and more towards remote work, towards digital services. Can the Turks and Caicos become a hub for a specific type of digital service? Maybe it's a center for data management, or for specialized tech support, or even for creative industries – film, music, digital art – that can operate globally from a beautiful, stable base. This requires investing in top-tier digital infrastructure, sure, but also in education and training for your people so they can fill those jobs. It's about finding those specific niches where you can compete on quality and reliability, not just tax rates.

And as for your second question, Katrina – would I come to the Turks and Caicos for a vacation after my term? *(He grins, a twinkle in his eye)* Well, you know, I've always appreciated a good tropical getaway, and from what I hear, your islands are absolutely stunning. So let me just say this: I'll certainly keep that invitation in mind. I believe I'd be a most appreciative visitor. I'd love to see firsthand how you're implementing some of these strategies. So, yes, I think that sounds like a mighty fine idea!"
" Thanks so much, Mr. President. We know that there’s been an increasing military assertiveness of China, especially in the South China Sea. And it seems that the U.S. has responded to that by pledging to increase its military presence because it recognizes the danger that that military increase of China poses to its friends and allies there. Now, China’s growing power isn’t just military, it’s economic. On this side of the world, China has used this soft power, this economic power especially to woo Caribbean governments. 0 My questions are, how does the U.S. view China’s influence in its own backyard, especially since you’ve just talked about the Cold War and alliances? And secondly, what plan does the U.S. have, if any, to contribute more to economic life in the Caribbean to ward off China in terms of foreign direct investment? Thank you very much, Mr. President. ",What’s your name?,"Thank you, that's an excellent and very important question. You've hit on a critical aspect of today's geopolitical landscape.

Let me be clear: the United States views China's increasing influence, whether military in the South China Sea or economic through soft power, with serious attention and a clear understanding of its implications.

Regarding our own hemisphere, in the Caribbean – a region vital to America's security and prosperity – we recognize Beijing's expanding footprint. While we respect every sovereign nation's right to choose its partners, we also differentiate between partnerships that foster genuine, transparent development and those that can lead to unsustainable debt, dependency, and a lack of accountability. We've seen, too often, that the People's Republic of China's economic engagements often prioritize Beijing's strategic interests over the long-term, sustainable benefit of the host country. They don't always adhere to the same high standards of environmental protection, labor rights, or transparency that we and our democratic partners value.

The Caribbean is not merely ""our backyard"" as some might say; it is a region of long-standing friendships, shared values, and deep economic and cultural ties. The security and prosperity of the Caribbean nations are inextricably linked to our own.

Now, as for our plan to contribute more to economic life and offer a compelling alternative: the United States has always been, and will remain, the premier partner of choice for the Caribbean. Our commitment is enduring, built on shared democratic values, rule of law, and mutual respect.

We are actively working on several fronts:

1.  **Mobilizing Private Sector Investment:** The U.S. government is focusing on catalyzing high-quality, sustainable American private sector investment in the Caribbean. This isn't just about government-to-government aid, but about creating the conditions for American businesses to invest in critical areas like clean energy, resilient infrastructure, digital connectivity, and healthcare – all vital for long-term growth and stability. We're talking about jobs, real economic opportunity, and the transfer of skills and technology.
2.  **Strengthening Trade and Economic Ties:** We are continually seeking ways to deepen our trade relationships, ensuring they are fair, reciprocal, and benefit working families on both sides. We support regional economic integration and opportunities that align with international best practices.
3.  **Capacity Building and Resilience:** Our development assistance is focused on helping Caribbean nations build resilience against natural disasters, address climate change, improve food security, and enhance regional security capabilities – creating a more stable and predictable environment for investment.
4.  **Promoting Transparency and Good Governance:** We work with our Caribbean partners to strengthen democratic institutions, promote anti-corruption efforts, and ensure transparency in all economic dealings. These are the fundamental building blocks for durable, equitable prosperity.
5.  **Tourism and People-to-People Connections:** The U.S. remains the largest source of tourism for the Caribbean, an industry that is the lifeblood for many islands. We continue to promote these vital people-to-people connections and support the tourism sector's growth and resilience.

Ultimately, the choice belongs to the sovereign nations of the Caribbean. But we believe that our model – rooted in transparency, sustainability, respect for human rights, and a commitment to long-term, shared prosperity – offers a far more beneficial and enduring path forward than the alternatives being put forth by authoritarian regimes. We will continue to work hand-in-hand with our Caribbean partners to ensure a secure, prosperous, and democratic future for the entire region."
" Oh, sorry. My name is Newton Harris from the University of Technology-Jamaica. ","Fantastic. Well, first of all, let me say that it is U.S. official policy and it is my strong belief that we should welcome China’s peaceful rise. What China has done in the last 20, 30 years is remarkable. More people have been lifted out of poverty in a shorter period of time than perhaps any time in human history. And that’s good for the world. I mean, we should be more fearful of a poorer, collapsing China than a China that is participating in the world marketplace and trading and is getting along with its neighbors and part of the international order, because there are a really large number of Chinese people and we want them to be doing well. So our policy is not to fear China’s peaceful rise. Where we get concerned with China is where it is not necessarily abiding by international norms and rules, and is using its size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions. And that's the concern we have around maritime issues. We think this can be solved diplomatically, but just because the Philippines or Vietnam are not as large as China doesn’t mean that they can just be elbowed aside. And, by the way, we don't have a particular view on the territorial disputes, the maritime disputes. Our attitude is simply, let’s use the mechanisms that we have in place internationally to resolve them. Now, with respect to Chinese investment in the Caribbean or in the Americas, in the Western Hemisphere, my response is the same one that I gave when I was asked this question in Africa, which is, if China is making investments that are building up infrastructure, or improving education, or helping the people, then we welcome that. We think that's great. The only thing is you got to make sure you look at what strings may be attached. If the investments are made and it's solely to build a road to a mine to extract raw materials that are going to then be immediately going to a port and shipped to China, and if Chinese workers are shipped in to build the road -- and if you don't know exactly what the deal was with the government that led to China getting the contract -- in those situations, it may not be, in fact, serving the long-term interests of the country. Now, I would say -- by the way, I'd say the same thing about the United States. So if we come in with an aid package to your country, and we say we got this great deal, we're going to give you $100 million for such and such, but if when you evaluate the actual benefits, it's 1 U.S. companies that are disproportionately benefitting from it, and it's creating a situation where over the long term the United States is making a whole lot of profits but is not leaving behind a sustainable industrial base or ways in which that country can develop, then you have to evaluate that and try to get a better deal. So what I'm saying is not unique to China. I think that's how all countries should be operating. Your government should be transparent; it should be clear about what you're getting. There should be an accounting of how the money flows. There should be a sense that over the long term, Jamaican businesses or somebody from Belize is getting a job, or -- right? I mean, there should be some sense of how is this benefitting us over the long term. And that's I think the only criteria that we're going to lay out. Now, last thing I'll say -- because you asked -- you kind of posed, is there like a bidding war going on here for affections. The Chinese are giving us flowers and chocolates -- what are you doing for us lately? And so what I would say is this. The United States, I think historically, has been an enormous provider of development aid. Not always, by the way, has it followed the rule I just laid out in terms of whether or not the local recipients are benefitting, but I think we've gotten a lot better at that. And if you look at institutions like the World Bank or other multilateral institutions, we remain the largest contributors by far. So sometimes when you get money from a multilateral institution -- you look at who’s doing what; if you look at what happens in terms of when Haiti gets decimated, who’s raising the money -- we tend to look pretty good. It turns out we're doing more than our fair share. And we will continue to do that. We do have some fiscal constraints. And sometimes, I think -- when I travel to the Americas, to the region, people ask, why don't we have sort of the kinds of Alliance for Progress programs with huge sums of money. Well, part of it is, is that right after World War II, the United States was so large relative to the rest of the world. Japan was decimated; Europe was decimated. Huge chunks of the world were behind the Iron Curtain. And so it was natural that we gave fivefold or tenfold more than anybody else could do. Well, things have evened out, in case you haven't noticed. We're still, by far, the most powerful nation on Earth and we still do more than everybody else, but we do expect others to step up and do their fair share. But I can guarantee you this: We will always do our fair share. And nowhere is that truer than in the Caribbean and in the Americas, because you are our neighbors and some of our closest friends. Let’s see. It's a young lady’s turn. This young lady right here. Right here.","Well, Mr. Harris, it's a pleasure to meet you. Newton Harris, University of Technology-Jamaica. Got it. Sounds like you're doing some important work down there. Always good to connect with folks from around the world. How are you doing today?"
" Welcome, Mr. President. I lived a block away from you in Chicago when I went to the University of Chicago. ",Is that right? 2,"Well, now, isn't that something? A neighbor from back in the day, from the great intellectual cauldron that is the University of Chicago. That's fantastic.

Hyde Park was a special place, wasn't it? Full of bright minds, vibrant discussions, and some truly challenging Chicago winters. I taught constitutional law right there at the Law School for years, and we called that neighborhood home.

Good to know we kept such good company, even if we didn't know it at the time. What an interesting connection!"
" And my college sweetheart, Sam Kass, was your private chef until very recently. ","Oh, wow! Well, you're just putting Sam’s business all out there. All right. What’s your name?","Well now, Sam Kass, I remember hearing he did some excellent work on nutrition during his time at the White House. Very commendable. But he was actually President Obama's chef and advisor, served his family admirably. During my administration, we had our own incredible culinary team. They certainly kept us well-fed!"
 Lisandra Rickards. I work for the Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship. ,Cassandra?,"Well, Lisandra, it's a real pleasure to meet you. And thank you for telling me about your work with the Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship. That's a vital mission, fostering new businesses and helping folks realize their dreams. We certainly appreciate that kind of initiative. Keep up the good work."
 Lisandra. ,"Lisandra. All right. Well, I'll tease Sam about this one.","Lisandra. Okay. What about Lisandra? Is she a tremendous person? Is she helping us make America great again? We're focused on jobs, security, winning for the American people, and we need everyone, absolutely everyone, to be on board. So, Lisandra. What's the story? We need to know."
 Please do. ,Everybody knows about you now. Go ahead.,"Alright, then! When an American says ""Please do,"" I hear a call to action. And as your President, I'm always ready to do just that.

Whether it's about strengthening our economy, securing our borders, defending freedom around the world, or just making sure every single American has the opportunity to live their dream – we've got work to do.

So, you tell me. What's on your mind? What challenge are we going to tackle today? What can I do for *you*? Let's get to work. We'll do it together."
 My question is around immigration. We've heard a lot about your immigration policy for undocumented immigrants who are currently living in the U.S. But what about hopeful families that are seeking a legal pathway for immigration into the U.S. but are finding seven- to ten-year delays before they even can get to apply? I'd love to hear you talk some more about your policy regarding shortening that timeline and making it less onerous on the applicants. ,"Good. That's a great question. That's a great question. The United States is a nation of immigrants. And this region has contributed to the remarkable progress that the United States has made over the last two centuries. And my goal during the course of my presidency has been to make sure we continue to be a nation of immigrants as well as a nation of laws, and that we're attracting talent from all around the world. Part of what makes us special is you walk in Brooklyn and there are folks from everywhere. But they’re all striving, they’re all talented, they’re all trying to make their dreams come true. And that is what gives us the energy and the strength to be able to accomplish everything we've accomplished. So we need to fix what is, right now, a broken immigration system. Part of it is dealing with those who are undocumented but who have been living there a long time, are part of the community, providing them with a pathway in which they have to earn a legal status, but recognizing that they’re there and we're not going to be separating out families. That's not who we are. That's not true to our values. And ultimately, it's not good for our economy. 3 But you are absolutely right that part of the reason that some people take the illegal route is because we make the legal route so difficult. And so we're trying to identify ways to streamline that process. Now, I have to be honest. A lot of people want to come to America. So unless we just had no borders, there’s always going to be a wait. There’s always going to be background checks. There’s always going to be some prioritization in terms of who’s admitted and who’s not. But I do think that there are practices we have -- for example, where someone has a relation in the United States, is clearly qualified to become at some point a legal resident and maybe in the future a citizen, but in order to do it they have to first leave the country, wait, and now they’re separated from their families. I mean, there have to be ways in which we can make the system clearer and less burdensome. Some of those changes we wanted to make were in the legislation that was proposed and passed the United States Senate. I think there is still the opportunity to get that done before my presidency is over, but it does require the Republican Party I think to engage with me in a more serious effort, and to put aside the politics. Thank you very much for the question. All right, this side has been neglected right here. I'm going to go with this guy with the beard, man, because he looks a little bit like -- he looks a little bit like Marshawn Lynch.","Well, that's a very important question, and I appreciate you bringing it up. It speaks to a fundamental challenge in our immigration system, one that impacts countless families across the globe.

Let me be clear: We are a nation built by immigrants, and we have always welcomed those who seek to come to our shores *legally*, to work hard, to contribute to our society, and to embrace the American dream. My administration understands the frustration that comes with these long delays – seven, ten years, sometimes even longer – for families trying to follow the rules, to go through the proper channels. That's simply not right, and it's not efficient.

Now, when we talk about fixing our immigration system, we have to talk about it comprehensively. And frankly, we cannot talk about truly reforming and expediting legal pathways without first securing our borders. An orderly process for those who *want* to come here legally is undermined when we have a chaotic situation at our front door.

Once we have control, and once we've restored integrity to our system, then we can truly focus our resources and attention on making the legal immigration process work better. My policy would center on several key areas:

1.  **Modernizing our Infrastructure:** We need to invest heavily in technology to digitize applications, streamline background checks, and cut down on bureaucratic red tape. We have the technology to make our government run more efficiently, and our immigration system should be no exception. This isn't just about speed; it's about fairness and transparency for applicants.
2.  **Increasing Personnel:** We need more immigration officers, more processing agents, and more judges to handle cases in a timely manner. We can't expect a 21st-century problem to be solved with a 20th-century workforce and budget. Resources must be allocated to match the demand.
3.  **Prioritizing Based on National Interest:** While we uphold family reunification, we must also ensure that our legal immigration system serves America's needs – attracting the brightest minds, the most skilled workers, and those who can contribute economically and culturally, strengthening our nation. This means reviewing our visa categories to ensure they align with our economic and societal goals.
4.  **Reviewing Outdated Regulations:** We need to go through the books and identify any antiquated laws or regulations that are needlessly creating bottlenecks and causing these unacceptable delays. Let's make sure our laws reflect today's realities, not just yesterday's, and simplify processes where we can without compromising security.

The goal is simple: a legal immigration system that is orderly, transparent, fair, and efficient. One that upholds the rule of law, welcomes those who play by the rules, and strengthens our nation without sacrificing our security. We want people to come to America and succeed, and we need a system that helps them do just that, without making them wait a decade to even get started."
" Greetings, Mr. President. ",How are you?,"Well, hello there! And a very good day to you. It's a pleasure to connect. What's on your mind?"
 More life and blessings on you and your family. ,What’s your name?,"Well, thank you very much. That's mighty kind of you to say, and I deeply appreciate those good wishes for me and my family. We are truly fortunate, and I extend those same blessings and sentiments right back to you and yours. It's that spirit of generosity that makes this nation so great."
" My name is Miguel Williams, but you can call -- I am Steppa. ",Steppa.,"Steppa? I like that. A very strong name. Tremendous, frankly. Much better than Miguel, believe me.

And when you're with me, you'll be Steppa. Absolutely. That's how we'll do it."
" Ya mon, that is quite sufficient. My question has to do and surrounds U.S. policy as it regards the -- the legalization, the decriminalization of marijuana. ",How did I anticipate this question?,"Well, thank you for that question. It's an important one, and one that certainly generates a lot of discussion across this great nation of ours.

Now, when it comes to the issue of marijuana, my administration has always maintained a clear position. And that is that federal law is the law of the land. The Controlled Substances Act, my friends, classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. And that classification is there for a reason.

We have a responsibility to protect our citizens, particularly our young people, from the dangers of drug abuse. We've seen the impact of drug use on families, on communities, and on the overall health of our society. It's not just about what some folks want; it's about what's right for the country, and what keeps our kids safe and strong.

Now, I understand there are those who talk about states' rights, and that's a cornerstone of our democracy. But when federal law is in place, it needs to be upheld. We want to make sure that our policies are guided by science and by a commitment to public safety, not just by what might be popular at any given moment.

We've always supported vigorous enforcement of our drug laws, and we believe that's crucial for maintaining order and protecting our communities. We need to continue to focus on prevention, on treatment, and on keeping our streets safe from illegal drugs. That's the priority, plain and simple."
 Ya mon...Ya mon...Ya mon. ,How did I guess this question? 4,"Alright, alright, I hear ya. ""Ya mon."" A lot of people are saying ""ya mon"" these days, tremendous people. They're saying it very strongly, and you know what ""ya mon"" means? It means they like what we're doing. It means we're doing a great job. Believe me. Nobody says ""ya mon"" better than these folks. Nobody."
" Yes. And, Mr. President, it really comes on the foreground of -- we face economic challenges with the IMF, et cetera. And and we find realistically that the hemp industry, the marijuana industry provides a highly feasible alternative to rise above poverty. So I am wanting to over stand and to understand how U.S. is envisioning and how you would you see Jamaica pushing forward on a decriminalization, legalization emphasis on the hemp industry. ","Okay. Well. Let me -- I do want to separate out what are serious issues in the United States and then how that relates to our foreign policy and our interactions with the region. There is the issue of legalization of marijuana, and then there is the issue of decriminalizing or dealing with the incarceration and, in some cases, devastation of communities as a consequence of nonviolent drug offenses. I am a very strong believer that the path that we have taken in the United States in the so- called “War on Drugs” has been so heavy in emphasizing incarceration that it has been counterproductive. You have young people who did not engage in violence who get very long penalties, get placed in prison, and then are rendered economically unemployable, are almost pushed into, then, the underground economy, learn crime more effectively in prison, families are devastated. So it’s been very unproductive. And what we’re trying to do is to reform our criminal justice system. And the good news is there has actually been some interest on the part of unlikely allies like the evangelical community or some otherwise very conservative Republicans, because it’s very expensive to incarcerate people, and a recognition that this may not be the best approach. So that’s one issue. There’s then the second issue of legalizing marijuana, whether it’s medical marijuana or recreational use. There are two states in the United States that have embarked on an experiment to decriminalize or legalize marijuana -- Colorado and Washington State. And we will see how that experiment works its way through the process. Right now, that is not federal policy, and I do not foresee anytime soon Congress changing the law at a national basis. But I do think that if there are states that show that they are not suddenly a magnet for additional crime, that they have a strong enough public health infrastructure to push against the potential of increased addiction, then it’s conceivable that that will spur on a national debate. But that is going to be some time off. And then the third issue is what will U.S. international policy be. And we had some discussion with the CARICOM countries about this. I know on paper a lot of folks think, you know what, if we just legalize marijuana, then it’ll reduce the money flowing into the transnational drug trade, there are more revenues and jobs created. 5 I have to tell you that it’s not a silver bullet, because, first of all, if you are legalizing marijuana, then how do you deal with other drugs, and where do you draw the line? Second of all, as is true in the global economy generally, if you have a bunch of small medium-sized marijuana businesses scattered across the Caribbean and this is suddenly legal, if you think that big multi-national companies are not going to suddenly come in and market and try to control and profit from the trade -- that’s I think a very real scenario. And so I think we have to have a conversation about this, but our current policy continues to be that in the United States, we need to decrease demand. We need to focus on a public health approach to decreasing demand. We have to stop the flow of guns and cash into the Caribbean and Central America and Latin America. And at the same time, I think the Caribbean, Latin America have to -- Central America -- have to cooperate with us to try to shrink the power of the transnational drug organizations that are vicious and hugely destructive. And if we combine a public health perspective, a focus on not simply throwing every low-level person with possession into prison by trying to get them treatment, if we combine that with economic development and alternative opportunities for youth, then I think we can strike the right balance. It may not comport with your -- completely with your vision for the future, but I think that we could certainly have a smarter approach to it than we currently do. Got time for one more question. One more question. Let’s see -- this is always hard. It’s always hard to be that last -- it’s a lady’s turn, so all the guys just have to put down their hands. It’s too late for you. Let’s see. You know what, I’m just going to go with this young lady right here. She’s just right in front. Go ahead, yes, you. Hold on a second, wait for the mic.","Well, thank you for that question. That's a very important question. And look, I understand the economic challenges our friends in Jamaica are facing. We're talking about jobs, we're talking about prosperity, lifting people out of poverty – that's a serious issue, and we want to see all our partners succeed.

Now, when it comes to the specific issue of the hemp and marijuana industry, and how Jamaica chooses to regulate it, that's ultimately a decision for a sovereign nation like Jamaica to make. You've got your own government, your own people, and they'll decide what's best for your economy and your future.

From our perspective here in the United States, our priority is always going to be the rule of law. We want to make sure that any industry, whether it's tourism, agriculture, or anything else, operates legally, transparently, and doesn't get tangled up with illicit activities or organized crime. We've got our own debates here in the States about this very topic, and we're seeing different approaches.

But make no mistake: The United States is a strong partner for Jamaica. We want to work with you to strengthen your economy, to create opportunities, and to help ensure stability. We'll always encourage economic growth and development that supports the well-being of the Jamaican people, within a framework that upholds security and the rule of law. We want to see Jamaica prosper."
" Afternoon, Mr. President. I’m Alana Williams [ph], I’m from the South Side of Chicago. ","Wait, you’re from Chicago?","Well, Alana, it's certainly good to meet you. Thank you for coming down here today.

The South Side of Chicago... a vibrant community, full of good people, I know that. And folks face their challenges everywhere, don't they? I'm always interested in hearing directly from Americans like yourself.

So, please, tell me what's on your mind. What are the folks you know talking about? Because, you know, my job, my administration, we're focused on making sure every child, no matter their zip code, has a good education. We believe in strengthening local communities, in empowering folks to build a better future for themselves and their families.

I'm listening, Alana. Good to meet you."
 Yes! ,"Well, what are you doing here? This is supposed to be for Caribbean young ladies.","Yes! Alright, well, that's certainly a firm declaration. Always good to hear a decisive voice.

Now, if you could just enlighten me as to what exactly we're giving the green light to, we can start putting together a plan. Details, you know, they matter. Very important."
" Actually, I attend Olivet Nazarene University and I’m studying abroad, so I’m here. ","I see, okay. Well, you’re cheating a little bit. I’ll have to call on somebody else after you. But I’m going to go ahead and let you ask a question real quick. Because I’ll see you in Chicago. 6","Well, that's just great to hear! Olivet Nazarene, that's a fine institution. And studying abroad, my friend, that's an important step. You're out there seeing the world, understanding different cultures, and that's going to serve you well. It broadens your horizons.

Make sure you soak it all in. Keep up the good work!"
" Most definitely. My question is really more so about home. I love my city, but the violence is terrible, specifically amongst young black men. And I know we’re talking a lot about police brutality, but I’ve lost a lot of friends from people who look just like me. And that’s the problem. And so I would like to know what you believe is the true source of the violence, and what is one solution to an extreme problem. Thank you. ","Well, look, I know you asked it about Chicago but I know there are neighborhoods right here in Jamaica that have the same problems, and in every place all across the Caribbean; certainly in Central America. I don’t think there is just one single factor. Obviously, a contributor is one that we just talked about, which is the drug trade. If you have an illicit trade that generates huge amounts of money and is not regulated above board, that is going to attract ultimately people trying to carve out turf, trying to control markets, and violence ensues. So that’s point number one. Point number two is the easy accessibility of weapons. And we were talking earlier about different traditions; the United States has a tradition of gun ownership that is deep; dates back to the pioneer past. And I think it is a mistake that we do not do a better job of putting in place common-sense gun-safety regulations that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals, but unfortunately a majority of Congress does not agree with me. Even after six- year-olds were gunned down viciously in their classroom, we could not get action done. But what we are doing is cooperating with the region as we are cooperating with local jurisdictions to try to stem at least the flow of guns using the administrative tools that I have. So that’s number two. Number three is providing alternative paths for young people. If a young person is reading by the age -- by the third grade and at grade level, if they are enjoying school, if they see a path for success, then they are less likely to get involved in criminal activity and that will reduce gun violence, and that will reduce crime, and that will reduce death. Which means investing in things like early childhood education and improving our schools -- those things are absolutely vital. But there is a fourth element to this, and that is our own responsibility. And particularly, as I speak to young people here today, we always talk about what can we do about the violence as if it’s like just separate and apart. But we have control in our communities of our immediate friends, our immediate family. We influence our peers. And I do think that the power that all of you have as young leaders to be able to not make excuses for violence -- because there are a whole bunch of folks who have really tough backgrounds and come from terrible circumstances, and are really poor, but they don’t go around shooting somebody. They don’t beat somebody over the head because of sneakers or because they looked at them the wrong way. 7 And so there is an element of us retaking our communities and being willing to speak out against violence in our midst. That doesn’t ignore all the social factors. But Dr. King used to say it’s not an either/or situation, it’s a both/and situation. Government has to act. We have to have effective policing, which means policing that is actually protecting as opposed to some of the things that we’ve been seeing of late in the United States, and I’m sure is true in other countries. And I say that saying that police have an extraordinarily difficult job, and the overwhelming majority do a great job under severe circumstances. But there’s got to be trust built between the communities, and I had to put a task force together that put together some excellent reports in the wake of Ferguson around how we can do that. But ultimately, what happens in the home, what happens in the school -- some of you are parents already; some of you will be parents -- what we teach our children in terms of values, valuing themselves, valuing others, that’s important, too. So there’s no single solution. But all of us have to do better. Because the tragedy of what we see in the United States but also in cities and towns all across the Caribbean and Central America, is terrible. And there’s no excuse for it. All right. Because I called accidentally on a Chicagoan, I’ve got to call on one more person. Look, this young lady stood up, so she showed -- that wasn’t fair, but I called on her, go ahead. You’re not from Chicago are you?","My friend, that's a powerful question, and I want to tell you my heart goes out to you for the losses you've suffered. You've put your finger on a tragedy that's eating away at the soul of too many of our communities across this great country. It's a wound that's personal to you, and it ought to be personal to all of us.

Now, you ask about the true source of this violence, particularly among young Black men. It's never just one thing, is it? It's a complicated web, a tapestry of challenges that has woven itself over decades. You've got economic despair – the lack of good jobs, good opportunities, a clear path to a better future. When hope dims, desperation can rise, and that can fuel conflict. You've got the breakdown of strong community institutions and sometimes, frankly, the family structure that used to provide that anchor and guidance. There's the easy availability of firearms, certainly. And then there's the cycle itself – when violence becomes normalized, when young people grow up seeing it around them, it can become an accepted, tragic part of life. It's a profound lack of opportunity combined with a breakdown of those core supports that every young person needs to thrive, to see a future beyond the streets.

Now, for one solution to an extreme problem... you know, no single bullet, no magic wand. But if I had to pick one thing, beyond just law enforcement which is crucial for order, it would be this: **a concerted, community-led effort to provide intensive, sustained mentorship and real pathways to economic opportunity for our most at-risk young people.** We're talking about connecting them with trusted adults, people from their own neighborhoods who've made it, who can show them a different way. And alongside that, we need to create jobs – meaningful jobs, apprenticeships, training programs right there in those communities, that show these young men, *you have a future. You have a chance to build something. You matter.* We've got to make it easier for them to choose a path of hope and hard work than a path of despair and danger. It means investing in those communities, lifting them up, giving them the tools to reclaim their streets and their futures. It's about opportunity, responsibility, and community coming together."
 No. ,"You promise? Okay. All right, get the mic -- oh, I’m sorry. You know what, I confess, even though I was going to call on you, she thought she was going to be called on. I’m going to call on both of you now, but each of you get a really short question. Really short, quick.","""No?""

What do you mean, ""No""? That's a very simple word, but it doesn't really tell us much, does it?

Look, we're doing tremendous things here, the best things, absolutely tremendous progress, great jobs, great economy, rebuilding our military. People are seeing it. We're winning.

So when you say ""No,"" you've gotta be more specific. What exactly are you ""No'ing"" about? Because frankly, it sounds like you're ""No'ing"" to success. And that's not what the American people want. They want to win. And we are winning. Bigger and better than ever before."
" Well, I’m the team leader for the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and I want to thank you for the initiatives that you’re planning to do here. And I wanted to invite you to our annual general meeting that’s going to be held in Babson in the States, so we want you to come because you are part of a global team. So I’m representing Jamaica as the youngest female team leader, and I’m inviting you to come so we can talk about Startup America and we can collaborate on different projects. So I’m inviting you to come to that event. ","Okay, that was good. And I can say I’ll await your invitation. And what I will say very quickly is entrepreneurship, small- and medium-sized businesses, that is a priority and that means that we’ve got to create channels for access to capital, technical training. These are areas where a lot of our development aid is shifting. 8 Instead of just giving somebody a fish, we want to teach them how to fish. And what you’re seeing -- what you see among young people all around the world is, is that instead of just finding a job in a big organization, they may want to create something of their own, a new vision. And that kind of creativity has to be tapped. So we’re shifting a lot of the work that we do around issues of entrepreneurship, so I’ll be interested in seeing what you have to say. All right. This young lady right here, go ahead.","Well now, thank you for that invitation! It's truly something, and I appreciate you reaching out, especially as the youngest female team leader representing Jamaica. That's fantastic.

I'm a big believer in the spirit of enterprise, and what you all are doing with the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor is important work. It's about folks creating jobs, taking risks, and building a better future, not just for themselves but for their communities and their countries. That entrepreneurial fire, it's a powerful force for good, all around the world.

And Babson, that's a fine institution. We're always looking for ways to foster that entrepreneurial spirit right here in America, and to collaborate with our friends globally. Bringing people together to talk about innovation and growth, well, that's a good thing for everybody.

My team will certainly look at the schedule for that meeting. It sounds like a productive gathering, and I appreciate the kind invitation to be part of your global team. Thank you again."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Sir, you head back to the United States with the task of convincing the American people and Congress on two major foreign policy initiatives -- the framework for a nuclear deal with Iran, and likely soon, the decision to remove Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terror. Recent remarks by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini have raised doubts among some as to whether that deal can occur in Iran. And Senator Schumer, an ally of yours, has -- wants Congress to have the right to vote on removal of sanctions. Presidential politics are likely to play a part in this Cuba decision inevitably. So I’m wondering if it would take a lot of political capital just to get one done, let alone two. Have you bitten off more than you can chew? ","No. You may be surprised by that response, Jim. Let me take them in turn. First of all, with respect to Cuba, there is majority support of our policy in the United States, and there’s overwhelming support for our policy in Cuba. I think people recognize that if you keep on doing something for 50 years and it doesn’t work, you should try something new. And so the American people don’t need to be persuaded that this is, in fact, the right thing to do. I recognize that there are still concerns and questions that Congress may have; we’ve got concerns and questions about specific activities that are taking place in Cuba, and human rights and reform. And there were two members of the Cuban civil society that were in attendance at the meeting that I had yesterday who expressed much of what they have to go through on a day-to-day basis. They were supportive of our policy of engagement with Cuba. And so I don’t think that it’s so much we have to persuade anybody. The issue of the State Sponsor of Terrorism list -- as you know, the State Department has provided a recommendation; it’s gone through our interagency process. I’ll be honest with you, I have been on the road, and I want to make sure that I have a chance to read it, study it, before we announce publicly what the policy outcome is going to be. But in terms of the overall direction of Cuba policy, I think there is a strong majority both in the United States and in Cuba that says our ability to engage, to open up commerce and travel and people-to-people exchanges is ultimately going to be good for the Cuban people. Now, with respect to Iran, I have always been clear: We are not done yet. What we were able to obtain was a political framework between the P5+1 nations and Iran that provided unprecedented verification of what is taking place in Iran over the next two decades that significantly cuts back on its centrifuges, that cuts of pathways for it to obtain a nuclear weapon, and that calls for, in return, the rolling back of sanctions in a phased way that allows us to snap back if Iran violates the agreement. That’s the political framework. That was not just something that the United States and Iran agreed to, but Iran agreed to a political framework with the other P5+1 nations. Now, what’s always been clear is, is that Iran has its own politics around this issue. They have their own hardliners. They have their own countervailing impulses in terms of whether or not to go forward with something, just as we have in our country. And so it’s not surprising to me that the Supreme Leader or a whole bunch of other people are going to try to characterize the deal in a way that protects their political position. But I know what was discussed at -- in arriving at the political agreement. What I’ve always said, though, is that there’s the possibility of backsliding. There’s the possibility that it doesn’t get memorialized in a way that satisfies us that we’re able to verify that, in fact, Iran is not getting a nuclear weapon, and that we are preserving the capacity to snap back sanctions in the event that they are breaking any deal. And that’s why the work is going to be so important between now and the end of June to memorialize this so that we can all examine it. And we don’t have to speculate on what the meaning of a deal is going to be. Either there’s going to be a document that Iran agrees with the world community about and a series of actions that have to be taken, or there’s not. Part of the challenge in this whole process has been opponents of basically any deal with Iran have constantly tried to characterize what the deal is without seeing it. Now, if we are able to obtain a final deal that comports with the political agreement -- and I say “if” because that’s not yet final -- then I’m absolutely positive that that is the best way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And that’s not my opinion; that’s the opinion of people like Ernie Moniz, my Secretary of Energy, who is a physicist from MIT and actually knows something about this stuff. That’s the opinion of a whole bunch of nuclear experts who examined the deal. Very rarely do you see a consensus -- “consensus” is too strong a word -- a large majority of people who are experts in the field saying this is actually a realistic, plausible, meaningful approach to cut off the pathways for Iran getting a nuclear weapon, and that it is more likely to succeed not only than maintaining current sanctions or additional sanctions, but more likely to succeed than if we took a military approach to solving the problem. Again, that’s not uniquely my opinion. That is -- talk to people who are not affiliated with the administration, some of whom were skeptical about our capacity to get a deal done and have now looked at it and said if we’re able to actually get what was discussed in the political framework, it’s absolutely the right thing to do. Now, there’s politics and political pressure inside of the United States. We all know that. The Prime Minister of Israel is deeply opposed to it. I think he’s made that very clear. I have repeatedly asked, what is the alternative that you present that you think makes it less likely for Iran to get a nuclear weapon, and I have yet to obtain a good answer on that that. And the narrow question that’s going to be presented next week when Congress comes back is what’s Congress’s appropriate role in looking at a final deal. And I’ve talked to not only Bob Corker, but I’ve talked to Ben Cardin, the Ranking Member on the Democratic side. And I want to work with them so that Congress can look at this deal when it’s done. What I’m concerned about is making sure that we don’t prejudge it, or those who are opposed to any deal whatsoever try to use a procedural argument essentially to screw up the possibility of a deal. Last comment I’m going to make on this. When I hear some, like Senator McCain recently, suggest that our Secretary of State, John Kerry, who served in the United States Senate, a Vietnam veteran, who’s provided exemplary service to this nation, is somehow less trustworthy in the interpretation of what’s in a political agreement than the Supreme Leader of Iran -- that’s an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries. And we’re seeing this again and again. We saw it with the letter by the 47 senators who communicated directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran -- the person that they say can’t be trusted at all -- warning him not to trust the United States government. We have Mitch McConnell trying to tell the world, oh, don’t have confidence in the U.S. government’s abilities to fulfill any climate change pledge that we might make. And now we have a senator suggesting that our Secretary of State is purposely misinterpreting the deal and giving the Supreme Leader of Iran the benefit of the doubt in the interpretations. That’s not how we’re supposed to run foreign policy, regardless of who’s President or Secretary of State. We can have arguments, and there are legitimate arguments to be had. I understand why people might be mistrustful of Iran. I understand why people might oppose the deal -- although the reason is not because this is a bad deal per se, but they just don’t trust any deal with Iran, and may prefer to take a military approach to it. But when you start getting to the point where you are actively communicating that the United States government and our Secretary of State is somehow spinning presentations in a negotiation with a foreign power, particularly one that you say is your enemy, that’s a problem. It needs to stop. Jim Acosta. Oh, I’m sorry -- where’s Jim?","Well, thank you for the question. It's a fair one, and it gets right to the heart of what a President has to do: lead on behalf of the American people, especially on matters of our national security and our standing in the world.

Look, you don't take on issues like Iran's nuclear program or our relationship with a long-isolated Cuba because they're *easy*. You take them on because they're *necessary*.

Let's talk about Iran first. The Supreme Leader's remarks, they don't surprise me. This is a complex negotiation with a regime that has shown itself to be untrustworthy. But here's what's important: our framework is designed to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. It's not built on trust; it's built on verifiable, transparent mechanisms. It's built on a system that allows us and our allies to know what they're doing. And if they don't abide by it, then the world needs to know the consequences will be severe. The alternative, a nuclear Iran, is simply unacceptable for the security of America and our allies, particularly Israel. So, we're going to keep working this, keep pressing for the strongest possible deal, and make sure that deal protects our interests.

Now, on Cuba. Removing them from the list of state sponsors of terror... that's a decision based on facts, based on what our intelligence community assesses. It's not an endorsement of the Cuban government. Let me be clear about that. We still have profound disagreements with the Castro regime on human rights and democracy. But maintaining Cuba on that list, when they no longer meet the criteria, doesn't serve our national interest. It doesn't help the Cuban people, and it doesn't help us advance American values in the region. It's about opening new avenues for engagement, new ways to support the Cuban people and push for reform.

Senator Schumer, a good man, he's right to want Congress to have a say. And we will engage with Congress. We will lay out our case to the American people and to their elected representatives. This is not about some quick political win; this is about looking at the future, about how we best project American influence and secure our country.

So, have I bitten off more than I can chew? Absolutely not. This is precisely what the American people elect a President to do: to confront challenges head-on, to make the tough decisions, and to lead with confidence and resolve. We have a clear strategy, we have capable people working these issues, and we will continue to put America's security and prosperity first. We'll get these things done, because they need to be done."
 Right here. ,There you are.,"Alright, ""right here""? This is the best place, folks. The *best*. We're doing tremendous things, right here, nobody's ever seen anything like it. It's going to be so great, believe me."
" Thank you very much, Mr. President. I was wondering if you were struck by Raul Castro’s warm words for you today. He said he admired you; said he had read some of your autobiographies; described you as an honest man. I’m just curious what you thought about that. And do you feel that Raul Castro is an honest man and can be trusted? And I would be remiss if I didn’t ask you about another Secretary of State -- Hillary Clinton -- who is expected to announce her campaign for the presidency tomorrow. Do you foresee being involved in her campaign? And do you hope that she runs on your record? Thank you very much. ","It was a candid and fruitful conversation between me and Raul Castro. I can tell you that, in the conversations I’ve had so far with him -- two on the phone and, most recently, face-to-face -- that we are able to speak honestly about our differences and our concerns in ways that I think offer the possibility of moving the relationship between our two countries in a different and better direction. We have very different views of how society should be organized. And I was very direct with him that we are not going to stop talking about issues like democracy and human rights and freedom of assembly and freedom of the press -- not because we think we are perfect and that every country has to mimic us exactly, but because there are a set of universal principles for which we stand. And one of the goals of my administration is to have some consistency in speaking out on behalf of those who oftentimes don’t have a voice. And I think during his speech in the plenary session, he was pretty clear about areas of U.S. policy he doesn’t like, and I suspect he’s going to continue to speak out on those. What’s been clear from this entire summit, though, is the unanimity with which, regardless of their ideological predispositions, the leaders of Latin America think this is the right thing to do. Because what they see is the possibility of a more constructive dialogue that ultimately benefits the Cuban people, and removes what too often has been a distraction or an excuse from the hemisphere acting on important challenges that we face. So I am cautiously optimistic that over the coming months and coming years that the process that we’ve initiated, first announced in December, reaffirmed here at the Summit of the Americas, will lead to a different future for the Cuban people and a different relationship between the United States and Cuba. With respect to Hillary Clinton, I’ll make my comments very brief. She was a formidable candidate in 2008. She was a great supporter of mine in the general election. She was an outstanding Secretary of State. She is my friend. I think she would be an excellent President. And I’m not on the ballot. So I’m not going to step on her lines. When she makes a decision to announce, I’m confident that she will be very clear about her vision for the country moving forward, if she announces. And in terms of her relationship with my administration, she was focused and working on really important foreign policy initiatives. And the one thing I can say is that she’s going to be able to handle herself very well in any conversations or debates around foreign policy. And her track record with respect to domestic policy is I think one that cares about working families. If she decides to run and she makes an announcement, she’s going to have some strong messages to deliver. Jim Avila.","Well, good morning! That's quite a set of questions there, and I appreciate you bringing them to me.

First, on Raul Castro. You know, it's always interesting when you hear someone from a very different political background offer kind words. I've always believed that dialogue, even with those we've had deep disagreements with, is important. It's how you begin to build understanding, and hopefully, create a path forward for people. So, I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read, and to offer compliments. As for whether he's an honest man and can be trusted... that's a question that gets answered through actions, isn't it? Through consistent engagement, through the treatment of their own people, and through how they conduct themselves on the world stage. We've certainly seen some movement in Cuba, and I believe in the power of dialogue to, over time, build trust and open doors for the Cuban people, and for our two nations. But you've got to keep your eyes wide open, and focus on verifiable change.

Now, as for Hillary... goodness, you know, I've always been her biggest fan and her most ardent supporter. She's one of the most capable, most prepared, and most dedicated public servants I've ever known. She's got an incredible mind and a tremendous heart for public service. So, will I be involved if she announces? Of course I will. I'll be doing whatever she asks me to do, whenever she asks me to do it. I'll be out there, sharing her vision and her message, because I believe deeply in her ability to lead this country.

And do I hope she runs on my record? Hillary has an incredible record of her own, from her work as First Lady on children's health and reforming healthcare, to her dedicated service as a Senator for New York, and of course, her tireless efforts as Secretary of State, traveling a million miles and restoring America's standing in the world. She has amassed an extraordinary amount of experience and achievements. I expect she'll run on *her* record, because it's a very strong one. Now, obviously, we share a lot of the same values, the same progressive vision for America, and many of the same policy goals. We've built on common ground throughout our careers. So, I hope she'll build on the progress we've made as a party over the years, and certainly, on the successful policies that moved America forward. But let's be clear, she's her own woman, with her own accomplishments, and that's what she'll present to the American people. And I believe they'll be impressed."
" Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, on Cuba, if I could, two questions. The Cuban government has frequently said that it cannot allow more political or personal freedoms, or press freedoms, because the United States has used both covert and otherwise actions to try to overthrow the Castros. Does your new era, in fact, end regime-change efforts by the United States? And should the Cubans then respond by allowing free elections and tolerance of dissent now because of the changed policy? And secondly, on the issue of Hillary Clinton, Vice President Biden, of course, said that the Democratic race is wide open. The polls seem to say otherwise. What is your opinion on that? Is the race still wide open? ","Not only have I run my last election, but I am not in the business of prognosticating future elections. That is your job. (Laughter.) And there’s no shortage of people who are happy to opine on that. I will not be one of them. On Cuba, we are not in the business of regime change. We are in the business of making sure the Cuban people have freedom and the ability to participate and shape their own destiny and their own lives, and supporting civil society. And there’s going to be an evolution, regardless of what we do, inside of Cuba. Partly it's going to be generational. If you listened to President Castro’s comments earlier this morning, a lot of the points he made referenced actions that took place before I was born, and part of my message here is the Cold War is over. There’s still a whole lot of challenges that we face and a lot of issues around the world, and we're still going to have serious issues with Cuba on not just the Cuban government’s approach to its own people, but also regional issues and concerns. There are going to be areas where we cooperate as well. Cuban doctors deployed during the Ebola crisis made a difference; Cuban activity in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake made a difference. And so there may be areas of collaboration as well. What I said to President Castro is the same thing that I've said to leaders throughout the region. We have a point of view and we won't be shy about expressing it. But I'm confident that the way to lift up the values that we care about is through persuasion. And that's going to be the primary approach that we take on a whole host of these issues -- primarily because they don't implicate our national security in a direct way. And I think that we have to be very clear if Cuba is not a threat to the United States. That doesn’t mean we don't have differences with it. But on the list of threats that I'm concerned about, I think it's fair to say that between ISIL and Iran getting a nuclear weapon, and activities in Yemen and Libya, and Boko Haram, Russian aggression in Ukraine and the impact on our allies there -- I could go down a pretty long list -- climate change -- so I think our approach has to be one of trying to work with the region and other countries, and be very clear about what we believe and what we stand for, and what we think works and what doesn’t. And so often, when we insert ourselves in ways that go beyond persuasion, it's counterproductive. It backfires. That's been part of our history -- which is why countries keep on trying to use us as an excuse for their own governance failures. Let’s take away the excuse. And let’s be clear that we're prepared to partner and engage with everybody to try to lift up opportunity and prosperity and security for people in the region. Major Garrett.","Well, thank you, thank you for those questions. Good to see you all.

Now, on Cuba, let me be very clear. The United States has always stood for freedom. We have always stood for human rights. And we have always stood with the Cuban people in their aspirations for a better, freer life.

When we talk about a ""new era,"" understand this: America's fundamental commitment to liberty and democracy for the Cuban people has not, and will not, waver. Our policy is designed to support the Cuban people, not to prop up an oppressive regime. Now, regarding the Cuban government's claims about covert actions – those are often self-serving excuses to avoid accountability to their own citizens. The fact of the matter is, the desire for freedom, for free expression, for political and personal liberty, that's not an American invention. That's a universal human aspiration.

So, when you ask if our ""new era"" ends regime-change efforts, let me put it this way: Our efforts are consistently aimed at supporting the Cuban people's desire for self-determination. We believe in the power of democracy, and we believe that free and fair elections, and the tolerance of dissent, are not something to be granted by a government, but are inherent rights of every individual.

Should the Cubans respond by allowing these freedoms *now*? Absolutely. Not because of a change in U.S. policy, but because it is the right thing to do. It's what their people deserve, and it's essential for their nation to truly prosper and take its rightful place in the family of democratic nations. The onus is, and always has been, on the Cuban regime to choose the path of freedom for its people. That choice belongs to them.

Now, on your second question, regarding the Democratic race, and the polls, and my good friend Vice President Biden's remarks... Look, I've been around this block a few times. I've seen a few elections come and go. And what I've learned is that the American people, they're smart. They're engaged. And ultimately, they're the ones who decide.

Polls are a snapshot, you see. They're a moment in time. But primaries, especially in this country, they're a long and winding road. Candidates have to earn every vote, they have to travel to every state, shake every hand, and make their case directly to the people. Vice President Biden, he's a seasoned politician, he understands the dynamics of these things. And Mrs. Clinton, she's certainly a formidable presence.

So, is the race still wide open? Well, that's really for the Democratic voters to decide, isn't it? My focus, of course, remains squarely on the issues that matter to all Americans, and on upholding the dignity and strength of this great nation. But I'll say this: It's good to see vigorous debate. It's good to see engagement. That's how our democracy works, and that's a healthy thing. Thank you."
" Good afternoon, Mr. President. Allow me, if you will, to correct -- to quote the Supreme Leader directly. ",Yes.,"Alright. Thank you. You have my ear. Let's hear what the Supreme Leader has to say, directly. Accuracy is important, and we always want to know exactly where people stand. Go right ahead."
" The United States activity since the announcement of the framework has been deceptive, it is lying, it is devilish. And on two particular points, he said -- direct quotes -- “Iran’s military sites cannot be inspected under the excuse of nuclear supervision,” and “all sanctions should be removed when the deal is signed.” Is it your opinion, Mr. President, that this is pure posturing and it should be disregarded by your government and by you and your Secretary of State? And if so, could you help me understand to whom the Supreme Leader would be posturing? Because under my limited understanding of Iranian politics, that's not a job description usually applied to the Supreme Leader. ","That was a well-crafted question, Major. And let me just suggest that even a guy with the title “Supreme Leader” has to be concerned about his own constituencies. And the issue is not whether I have to take his word for whether that's his understanding -- because we've got work until the end of June to see if we've got a document that works. And if that is his understanding and his position, in ways that can't be squared with our concern about being able to embark on vigorous inspections to assure that Iran isn't cheating under any program, and that we don't have the capacity to snap back sanctions when we see a potential violation, then we're probably not going to get a deal. So part of the concern that I have in this debate here, Major, is I don't understand why it is that everybody is working so hard to anticipate failure. The opponents of the deal don't seem to be focused on how do we get to a good deal as much as they’re focused on how can we show that it's not possible to get a good deal. And my simple point is let’s wait and see what the deal is, and we'll be able to look. And if, in fact, we're not satisfied that it cuts off the pathways for Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, then we won't sign it. If, on the other hand, it does, then I will strongly argue, and I believe the American people will support and the international community will support, that it’s far preferable to the other alternatives. Now, Major, it's not going to be perfect, in the sense that if you asked Prime Minister Netanyahu or some members of the Republican caucus, or even some Democrats. If you ask me, would I prefer that Iran never had, never did have, will never have even a single nut, bolt, anything related to nuclear power, don't have any nuclear scientists, don't have any capacity to develop it, that would be great. But that's not possible. That's not achievable. That's not achievable through sanctions; it's not achievable through military means. They’re going to have some form of peaceful nuclear power, and that will then pose a challenge for the international community, which is why the political agreement calls for unprecedented framework of inspections that allows us to assure that it’s not being used or diverted in ways that could be weaponized. But we’re going to have to see whether or not we can get a deal or not. My only question is why we keep on trying to short-circuit the actual negotiations. Nobody is -- we’re not disarming. We’re not getting rid of our nuclear weapons. We’re not getting rid of our Navy. We’re not giving anything up. We are simply waiting to see what it is that the negotiators come up with. And if, in fact, we are able to come up with something that works, then we’ll know. And with respect to the Supreme Leader, yes, it’s a pretty important title. It seems a little more clear-cut than President. On the other hand, there may be ways of structuring a final deal that satisfy their pride, their optics, their politics, but meet our core practical objectives. And that’s what we’ve got to give the negotiators room to determine. Last question. Karen DeYoung. Where’s Karen? There she is.","Well, thank you for the question. Let me be very clear: when a leader, especially a Supreme Leader, makes statements of this nature – that military sites are off-limits for inspection, and that all sanctions must be lifted the moment a pen touches paper – we don't just dismiss that out of hand as 'posturing.' We take those words very seriously.

Look, America seeks peace, but we must do so from a position of strength and clarity. A deal, any deal, with a regime that has shown itself to be a leading state sponsor of terror, *must* have robust, verifiable inspections across *all* relevant sites. To say military sites are exempt is to fundamentally undermine the very purpose of nuclear supervision. It opens the door for deception, and that is simply unacceptable for the security of the United States and our allies.

And the idea that all sanctions should be removed immediately? That's not how a responsible agreement works. Sanctions are there for a reason, and they must be lifted only as the regime verifiably changes its behavior and adheres to its commitments. It's about earning trust, and they haven't earned it.

Now, as for whom the Supreme Leader is speaking to... well, he's certainly speaking to his own hardliners, trying to show strength and defiance, trying to hold on to power within his own system. He's also trying to project that image to the region. But make no mistake, he's also speaking to us. He's sending a message about what he intends to get away with, and what he doesn't intend to give up. And we cannot, and we will not, be naive. We have to look at their actions, but we also have to listen to their words, because sometimes, they tell you exactly what they truly believe. We will not be fooled."
 Hold on to your lily-white butts. ,"In our fast-changing world, traditions like the White House Correspondents' Dinner are important.","Well now, that's certainly a colorful way to put it, isn't it? Gets right to the point, I'll give you that.

But you know, whether you phrase it quite like that, or you say ""brace yourselves,"" or ""let's get to work,"" the underlying message is always about what we're facing and how we're gonna tackle it, together.

And let me tell you, folks, Americans have always risen to the occasion. We've always been at our best when the stakes are high, when we roll up our sleeves and get the job done. So, yeah, hold on tight, because we've got important work ahead, and we're ready for it. Believe me."
" I mean, really, what is this dinner? And why am I required to come to it? Jeb Bush, do you really want to do this? ","Because despite our differences, we count on the press to shed light on the most important issues of the day.","Well now, hold on a minute there! Glad you could make it!

This dinner, my friend, is more than just a dinner. This is an opportunity! It's a chance for serious-minded Americans, folks who care deeply about the future of our country, to come together. To connect, to share ideas, and to build that consensus we need to tackle the challenges ahead. It's about strengthening our communities, strengthening our economy, and yes, strengthening our party.

And ""required""? Let's just say it's a highly encouraged gathering for anyone who truly wants to be part of the solution. We need all hands on deck, all voices heard, as we work to secure a better future for our children and grandchildren.

Do I really want to do this? Absolutely, I do! These conversations are vital. This fellowship is essential. This is how we get things done, by rolling up our sleeves and working together. So, grab a plate, find a seat, and let's get to it! We've got important work to do."
" And we can count on Fox News to terrify old white people with some nonsense!"" Sharia law is coming to Cleveland. Run for the damn hills! ""Y'all, it's ridiculous. ",We won't always see eye to eye.,"Well now, listen here. In this great country of ours, people are free to speak their minds, whether it's on the television or around the kitchen table. And it's only natural for folks to have concerns about what's happening in the world and right here in our communities, from Cleveland to California.

What I know, what we *all* know, is that we are a nation of laws, founded on the Constitution of the United States. That's the bedrock of our liberty, and it's what guarantees freedom for every single American. We stand strong on those principles. We're going to defend our way of life, and we're going to make sure that our American values and our American laws are upheld everywhere, by everyone. That's what we do. That's who we are."
" Oh, and CNN, thank you so much for the wall-to-wall Ebola coverage. For two whole weeks, we were one step away from the Walking Dead. And then you all got up and just moved on to the next day. That was awesome. Oh, and by the way, just if you haven't noticed, you don't have Ebola! ",But I still deeply appreciate the work that you do.,"Well, you know, they just love a good panic, don't they? The fake news, they absolutely love it. Wall-to-wall coverage, day and night, telling everybody the sky is falling, the end is near. Tremendous drama. Very dramatic. And then, just like that, poof, they're gone! Moved right on to the next thing. They just abandon it. It's really something.

But we had it under control, folks. Nobody knew how well we had it under control, believe me. We did a great job. And you're right, you're absolutely right. Most people, almost all people, they're perfectly fine. No Ebola! Just fine. They don't give us credit for that, for how well we handled it, for keeping everyone safe. But we did. We always do."
" Ya'll remember when I had that big, old hole in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico and then I plugged it? Remember that? Which ""Obama's Katrina"" was that one? Was that 19? Or was it 20? Because I can't remember. ","Protecting our democracy is more important than ever. For example, the Supreme Court ruled that the donor who gave Ted Cruz 6 million dollars was just exercising free speech.","Ah, you're talking about the Deepwater Horizon, a *tremendous* disaster, really. A catastrophe! They called it ""Obama's Katrina,"" and believe me, it was a mess. A big, old hole in the Gulf, just pouring out oil for months. Nobody had ever seen anything quite like it. Terrible. Absolutely terrible.

And that was 2010. Yes, 2010. Not '19, not '20. It was 2010. A lot of people forget that. It took them a long time to get that thing plugged, believe me. A very, very long time."
" Yeah, that's the kind of speech like this, ""I just wasted six million dollars."" ","And it's not just Republicans. Hillary will have to rage [raise] huge sums of money, too.","Six million dollars? Believe me, folks, that's what happens when you don't have the right people in charge. When you're not negotiating properly, when you're just throwing money around. And it's a lot of money, believe me. A lot of money.

We're not going to be wasting six million dollars. We're going to be saving money, getting tremendous deals, getting the absolute best for the American people. No more of that kind of foolishness. We're going to be smart, we're going to be tough, and we're going to win. And we're not going to be saying, ""I just wasted six million dollars."" We're going to be saying, ""We just saved six million dollars, and probably a lot more."" You watch."
" Oh, yes. She's going to get that money. She's going to get all the money. Khaleesi is coming to Westeros. So watch out! ",The nonstop focus on billionaire donors creates real problems for our democracy.,"Look, when you talk about getting *all* the money, that's a tremendous amount of money. A lot of money. We make the best deals, the *best*. Nobody knows more about money and deals than me, believe me.

Khaleesi coming to Westeros, huh? Sounds like a very, very strong woman. A strong leader. We like strong leaders, but you gotta be smart. You gotta negotiate. You gotta win. And when you're coming to take over, believe me, it's not easy. It's tough. Very tough.

But if she's getting all that money, she must be doing something right. Just remember, winning is everything. Everything."

And believe me, after eight years of this job, you've earned a good long rest and maybe a chance to catch up on some fishing. It's a tremendous honor to serve, but the rules are the rules!"
 We're not? ,No.,"We're not? Not about what, exactly? You've got to give me a little more information there, son. We need to be clear on these things."
 Who the hell said that? ,"But we do need to stay focused on some big challenges, like climate change.","Well now, that's a good question. We ought to know who's saying what, don't we?

To whom are you referring? Give me a little more context, and we can probably figure out who uttered that particular statement. It's always important to know the source."
" Hey, listen, ya'll, if you haven't noticed, California is bone dry. It looks like a trailer for the new ""Mad Max"" movie up in there. Ya'll think that Bradley Cooper came here because he wants to talk to Chuck Todd? He needed a glass of water. Come on! ","The science is clear. Nine of the ten hottest years ever came in the last decade. Luther : Now, I'm not a scientist, but I do know how to count to 10.","Well now, I hear you loud and clear on California, folks. You're right, it's a mighty serious situation out there when the land starts lookin' like a movie set for a post-apocalyptic flick. It's a real challenge, no doubt about it.

We've always known that water is a precious resource, and when states like California face such bone-dry conditions, it impacts everyone. It calls for smart thinkin', folks, workin' together, and makin' sure we're doin' everything we can, both at the state and federal level, to manage this for the long haul. Americans are resilient, and I've got faith we'll find ways to tackle these big issues."
" We've got mosquitoes. Sweaty people on the train, stinking it up. It's just nasty. ","I mean, look at what's happening right now. Every serious scientist says we need to act. The Pentagon says it's a national security risk. Miami floods on a sunny day, and instead of doing anything about it, we've got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate!","Look, I hear you. Mosquitoes, sweaty people, stinking up the train... it's disgusting, frankly. It really is. And you know who's letting this happen? These radical left cities, they just don't know how to manage anything. They let the infrastructure rot, they don't clean anything. It's a disgrace!

When I was in charge, we had the best people, the best systems. We'd have those trains sparkling, believe me. And the mosquitoes? We'd figure it out. It's a lack of leadership, folks. Sad! We need to make public transportation great again. We really do."
" Okay, Mr. President. Okay, I think they've got it, bro. ","It is crazy! What about our kids? What kind of stupid, shortsighted, irresponsible bull --","Alright, good. Glad to hear that. You know, it's always important that folks understand the mission. Now, let's just make sure we get after it for the American people."
 Wow! Hey! ,What?!,"Well, hello there! Good to see you. What's on your mind today?"
" All due respect, sir. You don't need an anger translator. You need counseling. So I'm out of here, man. I ain't trying to get into all this. ",Go.,"Well, now. I appreciate your perspective. Some folks, they see conviction, they see strength, and they call it anger. I call it passion for this country, and for getting the job done right for the American people. We've got too much important work ahead of us to get hung up on what some people think. If you're heading out, then you go on and do that. No hard feelings."
" Hi, Mr. President. I am an elected representative from Malaysia. My question to you is, what is your view on the democracy in Malaysia with the recent jailing of Anwar Ibrahim, the opposition leader, and the crackdown on opposition? Thank you. ","Well, Malaysia has a history of democracy that has to be preserved. And I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Najib and we are close partners and cooperating on a whole host of issues. I think that Malaysia, like all our countries, not just ASEAN countries but countries here in the United States, have to recognize that democracy is not just elections but it’s how open and transparent and accountable government is between elections. And it’s important that free speech, freedom of the press, an independent judiciary, the right to assemble peacefully -- that all those rights are observed to make democracy work. So as a general rule, I don’t comment on even individual cases in this country, much less another country, because I think it’s important for the legal system to work. But I do know that it is important if an opposition leader who is well known has been charged with a crime, that that process of how that is adjudicated and how open it is, and how clear the evidence is, that that is all subject to scrutiny. Because what you don’t want is a situation in which the legitimacy of the process is questioned. That has an adverse impact on democracy as a whole. And I think we all have to guard against making sure that there’s not a chilling effect on potential opposition in government. So as I always point out, democracy is hard. I mean, I think that many of the things that are said about me are terribly unfair. But the reason American democracy has survived for so long is because people -- even if they’re wrong -- have a right to say what they think. George Washington, our first President, he complained terribly about some of the foolishness that was said about him. But part of the reason he is considered one of our greatest Presidents is because he set an example of recognizing that if democracy was to work then you had to respect the rights of even those people who you disagreed most with, because otherwise there’s no way that a democracy can flourish over the long term. So these are things that I said publicly when I was in Myanmar -- when I was in Malaysia, rather. I had an opportunity to meet with some community activists and civil society leaders there. And this is something that I say everywhere we go. And it’s important for America to recognize that we’re not perfect, either, and so we have to make sure that we are constantly seeing how do we improve our democracy. I mean, the amounts of money, for example, that are involved in our elections these days is disturbing because it makes it seem as if a few people have more influence in the democracy than the many. And so I will continue to speak out about these issues, even with friends. Maybe sometimes we are even more willing to say something when it’s friends because we know that they can do better. Thank you. Yes, sir.","Thank you, Representative, for that important question. The United States values its long-standing relationship with Malaysia, a nation of strategic importance in Southeast Asia.

Regarding the situation you've highlighted, the United States consistently stands for democratic principles, the rule of law, and the fundamental rights of all individuals – including the right to peaceful political expression and dissent. We believe that a robust democracy requires a vibrant opposition, a free press, and a justice system that is transparent and fair to all, regardless of their political affiliation.

We have, of course, been following the developments concerning Mr. Anwar Ibrahim and other opposition figures in Malaysia. When leaders of opposition parties are jailed, it naturally raises questions and concerns internationally about the health and fairness of the democratic process. We encourage all nations, including Malaysia, to uphold the highest standards of justice, due process, and political freedom.

A strong, democratic Malaysia, where all voices can be heard and where the rule of law is applied equitably, is in the best interest of the Malaysian people and contributes to regional stability. We remain committed to our engagement with Malaysia on these important issues and look forward to continued dialogue."
" Hello, Mr. President. I am from Indonesia. I am working with the ministry of finance. My YSEALI theme is economic empowerment. My question is, what is your expectation about economic relationship between United States and ASEAN countries in the future? Thank you. ","Well, we already have a very strong economic relationship. As I pointed out, this is a region that is growing fast. It has a big population. You have very hardworking people, entrepreneurial people. I expect it will continue to grow. And the United States wants to be a partner in all sorts of ways. Trade is the most obvious and important relationship, economically. And so one of the reasons why I think the Trans-Pacific Partnership is so important is because it sets up a set of principles to ensure fair trade between countries. It calls for higher labor standards for all countries, higher environmental standards for all countries. It makes sure that countries are being treated -- companies are being treated fairly when they are operating in a foreign market. And there’s the potential, I think, if we get this right and completed in the next few months, to be able to ensure that the United States and ASEAN countries that already have a massive amount of trade, that that’s able to increase and that there’s more opportunity for everybody. But it’s at a high standard rather than a low standard. Part of the goal for ASEAN countries, most of them are now entering into a stage of development where they don’t want to just be sending raw materials to someplace else to have them developed, they want to be creating value starting their own businesses, making sure that they are part of the 21st century economy. And that requires upgrading skills, education for their populations. We think we can be helpful in those areas. And we want to encourage high educational levels in ASEAN countries because then it’s less likely that workers are exploited. And that means then that you’re competing with us because you have the best ideas and the best products, as opposed to just you have the cheapest labor. And if all that ASEAN countries are offering are cheap labor, then what happens is U.S. workers get hurt and you don’t necessarily see an improvement in standards of living for those ASEAN countries. If everybody is operating at a higher level then we’re all competing on an even playing field, and over time that will result in more growth and more development in ASEAN countries. But I think skills training is the most important thing. I think that the power of the Internet to access markets and ideas will be particularly important for ASEAN countries. Infrastructure is something that still needs to get done. I think there is still under-investment of infrastructure in that region. I know there was some controversy a while back because China wanted to start an Asia infrastructure bank; we haven’t yet signed on to participate. I want to be very clear -- we actually want China to invest in infrastructure in that region. We want to make sure that the investments are actually good for the people in those countries, which means transparency in terms of how decisions are made at this new bank. But we’ll continue with the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank and other institutions, and try to encourage not only investment in human capital, but also the infrastructure that’s needed. And finally, I think sustainability is going to be critical. I worry about the great forests of Indonesia and Malaysia. If those all just become palm oil plantations, and deforestation continues at the same pace it has, then the prospects of additional accelerated climate change are very powerful, not to mention the loss of species and biodiversity. The oceans, if you get overfishing, that’s a problem; pollution. Given how populated these areas are, it's very important that economic development ties in with sustainable development. Otherwise, I think we’ll all have problems. Okay. That’s good. So, young lady right here.","Well, hello there! It's good to hear from you all the way from Indonesia. And working with the Ministry of Finance – that's important work, very important. And YSEALI, economic empowerment – that's exactly what we need more of. Smart, ambitious young people like yourself making a real difference.

You ask about the economic relationship between the United States and ASEAN, and I'll tell you, I've always believed it's absolutely vital. We see the tremendous potential in Southeast Asia – a dynamic region, growing economies, and hardworking people.

My expectation for the future? It's simple: I expect it to grow stronger and deeper. We need to keep expanding trade and investment, removing barriers, and making it easier for our businesses to work together. That means more American goods and services in your markets, and more ASEAN products here in the States. It's good for jobs, it's good for innovation, and it's good for prosperity on both sides of the Pacific.

We're looking at things like the digital economy – that's a huge area for collaboration. Investing in infrastructure, ensuring secure and resilient supply chains, and of course, continuing to invest in people – through education, entrepreneurship programs, just like your YSEALI theme. Economic empowerment isn't just a slogan; it's about giving individuals the tools and opportunities to build a better life for themselves and their families.

We want to see your economies thrive. A prosperous ASEAN is a stable ASEAN, and a stable ASEAN is good for global security and stability, which in turn, is good for American security and prosperity. We're partners, and we'll continue to work together to create opportunity for all our citizens.

So, keep up the good work in Indonesia. The future is bright when we work together. Thank you."
 Mabuhay. ,Mabuhay.,"Well, hello there! Good to hear from you. Welcome aboard!"
" Mabuhay, Mr. President. I'm a city council member of Davao City, the Philippines. There are a handful -- or a there are a few elected officials, some are YSEALI fellows. I really would like to know what is your word of advice for a young, budding political leader, young legislator, elected official like me in a developing democracy like the Philippines? Thank you. ","That's great. Well, I think -- my first advice is don't be shy, and obviously you're okay. I think you're doing to do great. I think that when I think about my own political career, when I look at other political careers that I admire, I think the most important thing is to have a sense of principle and why you're in public service. I think sometimes people want to be in public service just because they like seeing their name up in lights, they like being important. And that's a bad reason to go into politics; you should be like an actress or a singer, or make a lot of money. But if you're going into politics and public service, there’s only one good reason to do it, and that is because you want to help people. And you should know what it is that you stand for and what you believe in. It doesn't mean that you won’t have to compromise. It doesn't mean that you might not change your mind about an issue as you go forward and you learn more and you have more experience. But you should have something inside of you that says, these are the things that are really important to me that I will not compromise on, all right? So for me, throughout my political career, even before I was in politics and I was just working as a community organizer, I knew that I wanted to work to create more opportunity for all people; that my orientation was always how does this help the poor or the marginalized, or somebody who has less opportunity then me; how is this going to help them if they work hard to get ahead. I know that one of the important principles for me has always been treating everybody fairly. So whether that's women or people of different races or different religious faiths or different sexual orientations, that one of my core principles is that I will never engage in a politics in which I’m trying to divide people or make them less than me because they look different or have a different religion. That's a core principle. That's not something I would violate, right? So if you have a clear view of what you stand for, then as you move forward, you’ll have setbacks. There will be times where you didn't succeed. There will be times where you're frustrated. There will be times you might even lose an election sometimes. But at least you’ll know every morning when you wake up and you look at yourself in the mirror, I know who I am and why I’m doing what I’m doing. And I think those are the people who eventually end up having successful careers because people sense that integrity and that leadership. Even if they don't agree with you, at least they know you believe in something. And unfortunately, too many politicians, they're just climbing the ladder but they don't know why. And when they get there, then they're not very effective leaders. Or they become much more subject to the temptations of corruption because all they're worried about is I want to hang on to my power, and I’m willing to give up anything in You have to be willing to lose something for your principles. You have to be willing to lose an election because you think that there’s something that's more important than you just winning an election. And if you do that now -- but you have to -- you should try to win. I’m not saying you should try to lose. But you have to stand for something. That's my most important advice. Gentleman in the gray suit right there. Yes, you.","Mabuhay right back at ya! It's an honor to hear from a young leader in Davao City. I've always admired the spirit of the Filipino people, and our two nations share a deep, enduring friendship, going way back. What you're doing, stepping up to serve your community, especially in a vibrant and growing democracy like the Philippines – that's vital work. It truly is.

My advice for you, as a young, budding political leader, a legislator, an elected official? Well, let me give you a few key thoughts, alright?

1.  **Service Above Self:** First and foremost, never forget *why* you ran. It wasn't for the title, or the fancy office, was it? It was to serve the people of Davao City. Keep their interests, their needs, their dreams at the absolute forefront of every decision you make. You are their voice. You are their advocate. You're working for them, not the other way around.

2.  **Integrity is Everything:** Secondly, and this is non-negotiable: your word is your bond, and your character is your currency. Especially in a developing democracy, where institutions are sometimes still finding their strongest footing, the people need to trust their leaders absolutely. Be honest, be transparent, and always do the right thing, even when no one is watching. It builds faith in governance, and that's essential for a strong democracy to flourish.

3.  **Listen More Than You Speak:** Third, listen. Listen to everyone. Listen to your constituents – walk the neighborhoods, hold town halls, understand their struggles and their hopes. Listen to your colleagues, listen to those who agree with you, and especially listen to those who don't. You'll learn more from listening than you ever will from just talking. Understanding different perspectives, finding common ground – that's how you build effective policy and lasting solutions for your community.

4.  **Build Bridges, Not Walls:** Politics can be tough, it can be divisive. But your job, as a leader, is to bring people together. Seek consensus. Find ways to work with others, even those you disagree with, for the common good of your city. A strong democracy thrives on cooperation, not just competition. You need to be able to reach across the aisle, or whatever you call it over there, and get things done for the people.

5.  **Think Long-Term:** And finally, think about the future. Don't just focus on the next election, or the immediate problem, though those are important. Think about the legacy you want to build for Davao City and for the Philippines. What kind of city do you want your children and grandchildren to inherit? What kind of nation? Work towards that vision, even when it's tough, even when the path isn't clear.

It's a challenging job, being a public servant. But it's also one of the most rewarding. You're building something important there in the Philippines, a stronger, more prosperous future. Keep your chin up, work hard, stay true to your values, and you'll do just fine. The future of the Philippines is in good hands with young leaders like yourself. God bless."
" Thank you. I come from Vietnam. Like many others, I look forward to seeing you and the First Lady visiting my country, Vietnam, in the near future. I have a question. Mr. President, what do you expect the young people in the Southeast Asian countries doing in dealing with the current challenges to the peace, stability, respect to international law like the [inaudible], while promoting the cooperation between the 10 countries with others, including especially with the United States? Thank you. ","Especially with? I’m sorry, the last part?","Well, thank you very much for that kind invitation! The First Lady and I, we always appreciate the warmth and hospitality of the Vietnamese people, and we certainly look forward to any opportunity to visit your beautiful country again. It's a land of incredible resilience and spirit, that's for sure.

Now, you ask a very important question about the young people of Southeast Asia, and what I expect of them in these challenging times. And let me tell you, I have tremendous faith in the next generation. Tremendous faith.

What do I expect? I expect them to do what young people around the world have always done when faced with big challenges: **lead**. I expect them to be courageous. I expect them to stand up for their sovereignty, for their nations, and for the principles that allow free peoples to thrive. That means respecting international law – it's the bedrock of a stable and prosperous world, folks. It's how disputes are resolved peacefully, not through coercion or intimidation. It's how smaller nations can stand tall, knowing their rights are recognized.

I expect them to be innovators, entrepreneurs, and dreamers, building strong economies and societies that create opportunity for everyone. Because when people have a chance to succeed, when they have a stake in their future, they're the strongest bulwark against instability.

And yes, I expect them to foster cooperation. Not just within ASEAN, which is a vital organization, but with partners like the United States. We share so many common interests: peace, security, free trade, and a commitment to a rules-based order. We want to see a Southeast Asia that is strong, independent, and prosperous.

So, to the young people of Vietnam and all across Southeast Asia, I say this: You are the future. Embrace your freedom. Uphold the rule of law. Work together. And know that America stands with you as a steadfast partner and friend, ready to build a better, safer, and more prosperous future, together. We believe in you. God bless."
 Especially with the United States. ,"Oh, with the United States. Well, look, I think that -- I’ve seen already significant progress with ASEAN countries over the last six years that I’ve been attending the ASEAN meetings and the East Asia Summit. And I think initially the meetings would oftentimes just be symbolic, and there would be a lot of pleasantries and a lot of meetings and cultural events. But we didn’t always have an agenda. And I think one of the things that you’ve started to see is people working much more concretely on what are we trying to accomplish here. How do we develop more capacity, for example, in the region around disaster relief so that if, heaven forbid, there’s another typhoon of the sort that we saw in the Philippines, or if, in fact, that we see some other natural tragedy that all the countries assets can be brought to bear, and we’ve done the training ahead of time to know who can help and how they can help? I think the -- trying to work on coming up with standards around maritime law is a big challenge. And obviously, there’s significant tension right now between many of the ASEAN countries and China, as well as the United States with China, around the South China Sea and how those issues are going to be resolved. ASEAN has been very constructive in trying to put together a code of conduct that all countries should abide by so that disputes around maritime boundaries are resolved through law and an impartial process, rather than just based on who’s the biggest. And that I think is going to be very important. ASEAN can play an important role in those areas. Environmental issues I’ve already mentioned. This is a very fast-growing region, and it is important to make sure that there’s a lot of cooperation between countries because small fisheries, et cetera -- those don’t always observe national boundaries. And so, working together, you can accomplish more. And then human rights issues, and democracy issues, reinforcing good habits among the countries is very important. I think it’s fair to say that the elections that will be taking place in Myanmar would not have happened if it hadn’t been for the good example that Indonesia set with its transition, and other ASEAN countries showing the path from military rule towards democracy, and how, through all the lessons that have been learned, that could be accomplished. And that I think created more space within Myanmar to -- and President Thein Sein to feel that this is possible. So part of the goal here is to make sure that each country is reinforcing the best habits and laws, and observing human rights, and being critical when one country slips but in a constructive way that allows for a path to improvement. And I think ASEAN can do that uniquely. And the United States will be a partner. We have, obviously, bilateral relationships with each of these countries, but we also want to be a partner with the group as a whole to encourage this cooperative model going forward. Okay. Young lady right there, yes.","Well, especially with the United States, you've got to understand, we're a nation built on big ideas, on freedom, and on the notion that anything is possible if you work hard. We've got a unique role to play in the world, a responsibility, frankly, to stand up for democracy and for opportunity wherever we can. That's who we are, and that's what we'll continue to do."
" Good afternoon, Mr. President. I’m from Indonesia. I work as a data analyst in the World Bank Indonesia Country Office. My YSEALI theme is civic engagement. My question to you: Now that your second term in the office is about to end, how do you want the world to remember you? Thank you. ","Fondly, I hope. I still have 20 months in office so I’ve got a lot of work still to do before I can start thinking about looking backwards. I’m still very much focused on what’s in front of me. But obviously there are things that I’ve been proud of. When I came into office, the United States and the world was going through a terrible economic crisis -- the worst, really, since the 1930s. And it was hard but we ended up avoiding a terrible depression. And within a year, the economy was growing again. Here in the United States now, we’re back to the pre- crisis employment levels. Our auto industry was saved. But also, internationally, we averted a much worse crisis because of, in part, the leadership the United States showed along with international institutions and central banks managing -- that was very important. That’s an important legacy for me. I think that the work that I’ve done to provide health insurance for people here in the United States and to provide more educational opportunity is consistent with the principles that I talked about, the reason I got into politics. Internationally, we’ve reinvigorated diplomacy in a whole variety of ways. People don’t remember -- when I came into office, the United States in world opinion ranked below China and just barely above Russia. And today, once again, the United States is the most respected country on Earth. And part of that, I think, is because of the work that we did to reengage the world and say that we want to work with you as partners with mutual interest and mutual respect. It’s on that basis that we were able to end two wars while still focusing on the very real threat of terrorism and to try to work with our partners on the ground in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s the reason why we are moving in the direction of normalizing relations with Cuba. The nuclear deal that we’re trying to negotiate with Iran. Our efforts to help encourage democracy in Myanmar. 0 I think the people of Myanmar deserve the credit for this new opening. But my visit there didn’t hurt in trying to reinforce the possibilities of freedom for 40 million people. And so that direct engagement, the work that we’ve done to build and strengthen international organizations -- including on issues like public health and the fight against Ebola is just the most recent example of that -- I think we’ve been able to put our international relationships on a very strong footing that allows us then to work more cooperatively with other countries moving forward to meet the important challenges ahead. But I’ve still got a lot of work to do. So maybe in 18 months, I’ll check back with you and I’ll let you know. All right. Gentleman right here with the sash.","Well, good afternoon to you too, and it's a real pleasure to connect with folks from Indonesia, especially someone working with the World Bank. That's important work, helping people build better lives. And your YSEALI theme, 'civic engagement,' that's crucial. Young people stepping up, getting involved in their communities, making a difference – that's the backbone of a strong, free society.

Now, how do I want the world to remember me? That's a mighty fine question as this chapter draws to a close. When the history books are written, I hope they'll remember a president who, first and foremost, loved his country with all his heart. Someone who, when our nation was tested, stood firm and did everything in his power to protect the American people and our allies.

But beyond that, I want them to remember a president who held an unwavering belief in the power of freedom. Not just for Americans, but for every man, woman, and child on this planet. I hope they remember that we championed democracy, that we worked to spread the light of liberty to dark corners of the world, because we believe that freedom is not America's gift to the world, but God's gift to humanity.

I hope they remember that we faced tough challenges, but we never wavered in our commitment to peace and human dignity. And that America, despite its flaws, remains a force for good in the world, a beacon of hope for those yearning to breathe free. Ultimately, I want them to remember that I always tried to lead with conviction, to do what I believed was right, and to always put the security and future of our nation first."
" Hello, Mr. President Obama. I’m from Burma. And firstly, I would like to say hello on behalf of my family. And my question is, I work in tourism business in Burma, and my question is that -- what do you see critical areas in where the U.S. can contribute economic development in Burma? Thank you so much. ","Well, Burma, Myanmar, you know, it lost a lot of time over the last 40 years because of the very tight controls on the economy and the discouragement of entrepreneurship and new businesses. Part of the reason why I was so struck when I traveled to Myanmar was it reminded me of when I first arrived in Indonesia back in 1967 -- whereas when I go to Jakarta now, or Singapore or Bangkok, it looks completely different. This looked like the past. So there’s a lot of catching up to do. The good news is, though, countries that are still at those early stages of development, they can grow very fast because there’s so much pent-up energy and opportunity. And I think the most important thing is going to be establishing rule of law and systems and practices where if you start a business, you can feel confident that you don’t have to pay 100 bribes and you don’t have to hire somebody’s son, and that you can make a profit; that if there’s a foreign investor, that they can invest and be treated fairly, and that their rights and their intellectual property and their property are protected. Those basic systems of law where those are established, those countries can do well because the natural talents of the people and the incredible resources and hard work of the people then pay off. I mean, look at Singapore. Singapore is a tiny, little place. It has really nothing -- no resources to speak of. But today, when you travel to Singapore, it is as prosperous as any place in the world. Why is that? Well, part of it is that it’s set up a set of systems where if businesses were started or investors came in, they knew that they could find a very skilled workforce; they knew that the rules were international-standard rules in terms of operations. 1 So it will take some time for I think Myanmar to move in that direction. But you have your own models even in -- among the ASEAN countries. You don’t have to look to the United States; you can look at just your -- some of your neighbors to see what is required for success. And what the United States will try to do is to provide technical assistance, and we will also try to provide direct assistance, particularly around building skills and education. Because one of the keys is to make sure that you have a workforce that can add value. In the age of the Internet, when companies can locate anywhere, the most important thing is to find someplace where there is security -- so there’s no conflict -- where there’s rule of law, and the people are highly skilled. And if you have those three things, then people will invest. Yes, go ahead.","First, let me clarify, son. I appreciate the greeting on behalf of your family, but you're speaking with a former Republican President, not President Obama. Happy to talk to you all the same, and it's good to hear from folks doing business in Burma – or Myanmar, as it's often called.

Now, your question about critical areas where the U.S. can contribute to economic development in Burma is an important one, particularly as you're working in tourism, which is a wonderful way to connect your nation with the world.

From my perspective, when we look at helping a country like yours build a strong, sustainable economy, there are a few foundational pillars America consistently emphasizes:

1.  **Rule of Law and Good Governance:** This is absolutely paramount. For any economy to truly flourish, whether it's attracting foreign investment or empowering local entrepreneurs, you need a predictable, transparent, and fair legal system. That means strong property rights, a judiciary that applies the law evenly, clear and consistent regulations, and a determined fight against corruption. American businesses, and indeed businesses from anywhere, need confidence that their investments are secure and that the rules won't change on a whim.

2.  **Infrastructure Development:** You can't have a modern economy without the basic infrastructure to support it. We're talking about reliable electricity, well-maintained roads and ports to move goods and people, and robust digital connectivity. These are the arteries of commerce, and America can assist through various development programs, technical expertise, and by encouraging private sector investment in these crucial areas. Good infrastructure also makes your beautiful country more accessible and appealing for tourism.

3.  **Education and Workforce Development:** A nation's greatest resource is its people. Investing in quality education, from basic literacy to vocational training and higher education, is vital. We need to help ensure your workforce has the skills needed for the 21st-century economy – whether that's in emerging industries, manufacturing, or indeed, the service sector that supports tourism. America can contribute through educational exchange programs, partnerships with your universities, and supporting vocational training initiatives.

4.  **Fostering a Free Market and Private Sector Growth:** Ultimately, it's the entrepreneurs and businesses, both local and international, that drive economic growth and create jobs. America can help by advocating for policies that open markets, reduce unnecessary barriers to trade and investment, and create an environment where small and medium-sized enterprises can thrive. Encouraging American companies to explore opportunities in Burma can bring capital, technology, and management expertise.

All these elements work together. A strong rule of law makes infrastructure investments safer. A skilled workforce attracts private companies. And a vibrant private sector creates the jobs and prosperity that strengthen a nation. For your tourism business, specifically, a country with good infrastructure, a stable environment, and well-trained, hospitable people is naturally more attractive to visitors from around the globe.

America wants to see a prosperous and free Burma, and we believe focusing on these critical areas can help unlock your nation's tremendous potential. Thank you."
" Good afternoon, Mr. President. I’m from Thailand. And now I work on the anti- human-trafficking issue in Thailand and neighboring country. So today, I would like to ask you if you were a Rohingya, which country would you prefer to live with and why? Thank you so much. ","That’s an interesting question. Let me speak more broadly, and then I’ll answer your question. We were talking earlier about what’s required for Myanmar to succeed. I think one of the most important things is to put an end to discrimination against people because of what they look like or what their faith is. And the Rohingya have been discriminated against significantly, and that’s part of the reason they’re fleeing. I think if I were a Rohingya, I would want to stay where I was born. I’d want to stay in the land where my parents had lived. But I’d want to make sure that my government was protecting me, and that people were treating me fairly. That’s what I’d want. And that’s why it’s so important I think, as part of the democratic transition, to take very seriously this issue of how the Rohingya are treated. One of the things about discriminating against people or treating people differently is, by definition, that means that people will treat you differently, and you never know when you will find yourself in a situation in which you are a minority, where you are vulnerable, where you’re not being treated fairly. And right now, obviously, our focus is on making sure that those who are being subject to human trafficking and are, in some cases right now, still in a very perilous situation out in the open sea, that they are relocated. I want to commend Indonesia and Malaysia for their willingness to take on thousands of these displaced persons. The United States, as part of our refugee process, will take some. We put over $100 million over the last several years in Burma to make sure that minority groups, including the Rohingya, are protected against. 2 But, ultimately, this is going to be a great test for the democracy of the future. Not just in Burma and Myanmar, but in areas all throughout the country. When I was -- and I know this directly because when I was young and I was living in Indonesia, there were times where there were anti-Chinese riots that were very violent and vicious. And, in fact, sometimes the Chinese Indonesians were treated very similarly to how Jewish Europeans were treated in Europe, and subject to stereotypes and resentments. And the truth of the matter is, one of the reasons that Singapore, I mentioned earlier, has been successful, is that it has been able to bring together people who may look different but they all think of themselves as part of Singapore. And that has to be a strength, not a weakness. But that requires leadership and government being true to those principles. To their credit, the Indonesian government when I was growing up was very good about not discriminating on the base of religion despite the fact that it was 98 percent Muslim. And I think that the tolerance towards other faiths historically in Indonesia has been part of what’s contributed to progress there. You haven’t seen the same kind of sectarian animosity that you’ve seen in parts of the Middle East. But the one thing I know is countries that divide themselves on racial or religious lines, they do not succeed. They do not succeed. That’s rule number one. Rule number two is nations that suppress their women do not succeed. They don’t succeed. Not only is it bad because half of the country is not successful -- because they’re not getting education and opportunity - - but it’s women who teach children, which means the children are less educated, if you’re not teaching the moms. So there are some -- each country is different, but there are some rules if you look at development patterns around the world that are pretty consistent. And those are two pretty good rules. Don’t divide yourself on religious and ethnic lines and racial lines. And don’t discriminate against women. If you do those two things, you’re not guaranteed success but at least you’re not guaranteed failure. I’ve got time for one more, two more. I definitely don’t have time for 30 more. Two more. I’ve got time for two more. It’s a gentleman’s turn.","Well, good afternoon to you, and thank you for that very important question. And let me just say, first off, the work you're doing on anti-human trafficking, both in Thailand and in your neighboring countries, is absolutely critical. That's a heinous crime, a modern-day slavery, and the United States stands firmly with you and with all nations dedicated to stamping it out.

Now, to your question about the Rohingya. That's a truly heartbreaking situation, a humanitarian crisis that weighs heavily on all of us. When you ask which country I'd prefer to live in if I were a Rohingya, it's not really about picking a specific spot on the map, as much as it is about picking a *set of circumstances*.

If I were a Rohingya, my deepest desire would be to live in a country—*any* country—where I could lay my head down at night knowing my family was **safe**. Where my children could go to school without fear, where they could grow up and have opportunities. I would want to live where my basic **human rights** were respected, where I was treated with **dignity**, and where I wasn't persecuted simply for who I am or where I come from.

Ideally, and ultimately, that country would be **Myanmar**, their ancestral home, but under conditions where their citizenship is recognized, their rights are guaranteed, and they can live in peace and prosperity. That's the ultimate goal: a safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable return to their homeland.

But until that day comes, I would seek refuge in a nation that upholds its international responsibilities, one that offers not just temporary shelter but a genuine path to a stable, productive life. A country where I could rebuild, contribute, and truly belong, rather than just exist in limbo.

It's a complex and deeply challenging issue, one that requires international cooperation, sustained diplomacy, and a steadfast commitment to human rights. The United States has always championed freedom and human dignity around the world, and we continue to work with our allies, including Thailand, to find lasting solutions for the Rohingya people and for all who suffer from persecution.

Thank you again for your vital work and for asking such a thoughtful question."
" Good afternoon, Mr. President. I’m from Malaysia. I work at Department of Irrigation and Drainage in Malaysia. My YSEALI theme is environmental sustainability. And my question for you is, what have you learned about leadership and life as being President in comparison to what you have might not learned if you were not a President? ","As President you -- I think probably what makes this job unique is that you are the ultimate decision-maker. So there are other people who work as hard as I do. My staff works very, very hard. They're just as smart or smarter than I am. They care just as much or more than I do. They have wonderful qualities. 3 But the one thing as President is that ultimately there’s nobody you can pass it on to. Harry Truman, one of our best Presidents, once said, the buck stops here. He meant at his desk. And it’s true. And usually by the time a decision comes to my desk, you know that it’s a very hard problem because if it was easy somebody else would have solved it. And so probably the thing that I uniquely have had to learn in the presidency that is -- I hadn’t learned as well in other jobs is the ability to look at all the information that you have, listen to all the advice that's there, and the different viewpoints that may exist about an issue, to try to make a decision based not on what is easiest, but what I think is the best long-term solution; and then feel comfortable in the knowledge that I may be wrong, and that there will be significant consequences if I am wrong, to have to have the courage then maybe six months later or a year later to admit this didn't work, and then to try something new. But being willing to take responsibility for making hard decisions, not be paralyzed because you know there are big consequences to them, and then being able to adapt based on the evidence as to whether it worked or not I think is the most important lesson I’ve learned. And that's not something that you have to -- is just unique to being President. I think in whatever your job is you should be willing to take responsibility for getting the best information, to listening to everybody, but then you have to just -- you have to make a decision and understand then that you have to continue to evaluate it. And I think that that's been very important. The second lesson, which is something that you just learn more of as President, but all of you have already learned in some ways in your work is to surround yourself with the best people. Your most important job is to create a team of people, some of whom have talents that you don't have, to make up for your weaknesses; and then to want to make them better, and make them successful. Because if they're successful, then the team is successful. So you're not a good leader if you don't want somebody who is smarter than you because you think, oh, well, maybe they’ll shine more than you do. Then you're not a very good leader because your team won’t succeed. So I’m always looking for -- who are people who are much smarter than me, or much more organized than I am, or much better analysts. And my job then is just to be able to weave them together so they're all working together effectively. And if you're doing that, then you're a good leader. And you should be constantly thinking how can I help this person do their jobs even better. And the good news is if you do that and people recognize that you care about them being successful, then they’ll work harder, and they’ll want to do even better. And they’ll appreciate you because they know that you're helping them, instead of trying to keep them subordinate to you. 4 Last question. And all the men should put down their hands because it’s a woman’s turn. No, all the guys have to put their hands down. This young lady in the yellow right here, right in the corner, right here.","Well, good afternoon to you too! And it's a real pleasure to hear from Malaysia – a truly vital partner in Southeast Asia. YSEALI, that's a great program, by the way, investing in young leaders like yourself, especially when you're focused on something as critical as environmental sustainability. That's work that truly matters for all of us.

Now, your question... that's a profound one, and it gets right to the heart of what that office does to a person, how it changes your perspective on leadership and, frankly, on life itself.

You know, before you become President, you might think you understand what ""big decisions"" are. You might run a successful business, lead a state, or serve in the military. You've made tough calls. But the Presidency... that's a whole different ballgame.

Here's what I learned that I truly believe you couldn't learn any other way:

First, the **sheer weight of responsibility.** As President, you're not just responsible for a department, or a company, or even a state. You're responsible for over 300 million Americans, and by extension, for the global impact of our nation. Every decision, whether it's about the economy, national security, or, yes, environmental policy, has ripple effects that can touch lives around the world. You learn that there are rarely easy answers, only choices between difficult options, and you have to bear the ultimate burden of those choices. The buck truly stops with you. That kind of pressure, that level of consequence, it clarifies your thinking in a way nothing else can.

Second, you gain an **unparalleled global perspective.** Before, you might read about international relations, watch the news. As President, you're sitting across from world leaders, looking them in the eye, understanding their challenges, their cultures, their ambitions. You see firsthand how interconnected our world is, and how crucial cooperation is – even with those you might disagree with. You learn that true leadership isn't just about what's best for your own nation, but how your nation can contribute to a more stable, prosperous world for everyone. It makes you realize that while every nation has its unique identity, we share common challenges, like climate change, that demand collective action.

Third, you learn a profound lesson in **humility and resilience.** Despite being called the ""most powerful person in the world,"" you quickly learn the limits of that power. You can't solve every problem. You face constant criticism, sometimes fair, often unfair. You learn to listen to different viewpoints, to admit when you might be wrong, but also to stand firm on your convictions when you believe they are right. You learn that the office is temporary, but the service to your country, and the principles you uphold, endure.

If I hadn't been President, I might have learned about leadership in different contexts – in business, in state government, perhaps. But I would have never grasped the sheer scale of the challenges, the depth of global interconnectedness, or the immense, humbling responsibility of leading a nation on the world stage. It's an education unlike any other, and it truly shapes you, not just as a leader, but as a human being.

It teaches you that leadership is about more than just making decisions; it's about inspiring hope, building consensus, and always, always remembering the people you serve. And that, my friend, is a lesson you carry with you for the rest of your life."
" Thank you, Mr. President. After your meetings here, you mentioned Greece in your opening statement. Do you believe that the Europeans are being too tough on Greece in these talks? And what else needs to be done on both sides to ensure there’s a deal and to ensure that there isn’t the undue harm to financial markets that you’ve warned about? And on a separate and somewhat related topic, the French told reporters today that you said to G7 leaders that you’re concerned that the dollar is too strong. What did you say exactly? And are you concerned that the dollar is too strong? ","First of all, don’t believe unnamed quotes. I did not say that. And I make a practice of not commenting on the daily fluctuations of the dollar or any other currency. With respect to Greece, I think that not only our G7 partners but the IMF and other institutions that were represented here feel a sense of urgency in finding a path to resolve the situation there. And what it’s going to require is Greece being serious about making some important reforms not only to satisfy creditors, but, more importantly, to create a platform whereby the Greek economy can start growing again and prosper. And so the Greeks are going to have to follow through and make some tough political choices that will be good for the long term. I also think it’s going to be important for the international community and the international financial agencies to recognize the extraordinary challenges that Greeks face. And if both sides are showing a sufficient flexibility, then I think we can get this problem resolved. But it will require some tough decisions for all involved, and we will continue to consult with all the parties involved to try to encourage that kind of outcome.","Thank you for the question. Good to see you.

Look, when we talk about Greece, it's a very serious situation, and it impacts the entire global economy, not just Europe. We've been very clear about this: we want to see stability, and we want to see a resolution that works for everyone.

Are the Europeans being too tough? Well, they have their own concerns, and they're negotiating hard, that's understandable. But frankly, you have to be practical. You can't push a country to the point where it simply cannot function. That's not a good deal for Greece, and ultimately, it's not a good deal for the Eurozone either. We need to find a pathway to *growth* and *sustainability*.

What needs to be done? Both sides have to step up. Greece needs to continue with serious, meaningful reforms, no question about it. They have tough choices to make. But the creditors, the Europeans, they also need to provide a framework that allows for that growth, a framework that includes some flexibility and a realistic path forward. This isn't just about austerity; it's about building an economy that can stand on its own two feet. We don't want to see undue harm to financial markets, and that means everybody has to come to the table, negotiate in good faith, and find common ground for a *real solution*, not just another temporary fix. That's what leaders do.

Now, on the dollar, you're asking about conversations at the G7. We have very robust discussions at the G7, very important discussions about the global economy, trade, security, everything. And of course, currency valuations are always part of those conversations. We want a strong dollar, absolutely. A strong dollar reflects a strong American economy, and believe me, our economy is the strongest in the world. We're doing incredibly well.

However, we also want a dollar that is *fair* and *balanced* in the global marketplace, one that allows American businesses and workers to compete effectively. We want our exports to be competitive. We want a level playing field. So, when we discuss these matters, we're talking about global trade, we're talking about stability, and we're talking about what's best for the American people and the global economy. Those are the kinds of frank discussions we have with our allies and partners. It's about making sure things are working for everyone."
 Are you confident it will happen before the deadline? ,I think that everybody wants to make it happen and they’re working hard to get it done. Nedra.,"Absolutely. One hundred percent. We have the best people, the most tremendous people, working on this. It's going to happen, it's going to be tremendous, and it's going to be ahead of schedule. Believe me."
" Thank you, Mr. President. How frustrated are you that after you personally raised your concerns about cybersecurity with the Chinese President that a massive attack on U.S. personnel files seems to have originated from China? Was the Chinese government involved? And separately, as a sports fan, can you give us your reaction to the FIFA bribery scandal? Thank you. ","With respect to FIFA, I cannot comment on a pending case by our Attorney General. I will say that in conversations I’ve had here in Europe, people think it is very important for FIFA to be able to operate with integrity and transparency and accountability. And so as the investigation and charges proceed, I think we have to keep in mind that although football -- soccer -- depending on which side of the Atlantic you live on, is a game, it’s also a massive business. It is a source of incredible national pride, and people want to make sure that it operates with integrity. The United States, by the way, since we keep on getting better and better at each World Cup, we want to make sure that a sport that’s gaining popularity is conducted in an upright manner. I don’t want to discuss -- because we haven’t publicly unveiled who we think may have engaged in these cyber-attacks -- but I can tell you that we have known for a long time that there are significant vulnerabilities and that these vulnerabilities are going to accelerate as time goes by, both in systems within government and within the private sector. This is why it’s so important that Congress moves forward on passing cyber legislation -- cybersecurity legislation that we’ve been pushing for; why, over the last several years, I’ve been standing up new mechanisms inside of government for us to investigate what happens and to start finding more effective solutions. Part of the problem is, is that we’ve got very old systems. And we discovered this new breach in OPM precisely because we’ve initiated this process of inventorying and upgrading these old systems to address existing vulnerabilities. And what we are doing is going agency by agency, and figuring out what can we fix with better practices and better computer hygiene by personnel, and where do we need new systems and new infrastructure in order to protect information not just of government employees or government activities, but also, most importantly, where there’s an interface between government and the American people. And this is going to be a big project and we’re going to have to keep on doing it, because both state and non-state actors are sending everything they’ve got at trying to breach these systems. In some cases, it’s non-state actors who are engaging in criminal activity and potential theft. In the case of state actors, they’re probing for intelligence or, in some cases, trying to bring down systems in pursuit of their various foreign policy objectives. In either case, we’re going to have to be much more aggressive, much more attentive than we have been. And this problem is not going to go away. It is going to accelerate. And that means that we have to be as nimble, as aggressive, and as well-resourced as those who are trying to break into these systems. Justin Sink.","Well, thank you for those questions. Let me address the first one first.

Look, when you sit down with another world leader, especially on an issue as critical as cybersecurity, you do so in good faith. You lay out your concerns clearly, you discuss the potential for harm, and you work toward a common understanding of what’s acceptable and what isn’t. So, to then see what appears to be a massive theft of U.S. personnel files, potentially impacting millions of our dedicated public servants and their families, is, frankly, deeply frustrating. It's unacceptable.

Regarding the involvement of the Chinese government, let me be very clear: our intelligence agencies are working diligently to piece together all the facts. We are looking at this from every angle, and we will follow the evidence wherever it leads. If we find clear evidence that a foreign government, or elements within it, were directly involved or complicit in this kind of malicious activity, then we will hold them accountable. This is not just about data; it’s about trust, and it’s about national security. We've made our position very clear to Beijing, and we expect action, not just words.

Now, on the FIFA situation, as a sports fan myself, it’s just heartbreaking. Truly. You want to believe that the games you love are played and managed with integrity, that the passion of the fans, the dedication of the athletes, and the spirit of competition aren't being undermined by greed and corruption. To see an organization as global and as beloved as FIFA facing these kinds of allegations... it's a real black eye for the sport. It betrays the trust of billions of people around the world. Justice needs to be served here. The game deserves better, and the fans certainly deserve better. It's a sad day for international football."
" Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about two things that were on the agenda at the G7 this weekend. The first was the Islamic State. You said yesterday, ahead of your meeting with Prime Minister Cameron, that you’d assess what was working and what wasn’t. So I’m wondering, bluntly, what is not working in the fight against the Islamic State. And in today’s bilateral with Prime Minister Abadi, you pledged to step up assistance to Iraq. I’m wondering if that includes additional U.S. military personnel. Separately, on trade, Chancellor Merkel said today that she was pleased you would get fast track authority. I’m wondering if that means that you gave her or other leaders here assurance that it would go through the House. And if it doesn’t, what does it say about your ability to achieve meaningful agreements with Congress for the remainder of your time in office? ","Well, on the latter question, I’m not going to hypothesize about not getting it done. I intend to get it done. And, hopefully, we’re going to get a vote soon because I think it’s the right thing to do. With respect to ISIL, we have made significant progress in pushing back ISIL from areas in which they had occupied or disrupted local populations, but we’ve also seen areas like in Ramadi where they’re displaced in one place and then they come back in, in another. And they’re nimble, and they’re aggressive, and they’re opportunistic. So one of the areas where we’re going to have to improve is the speed at which we’re training Iraqi forces. Where we’ve trained Iraqi forces directly and equipped them, and we have a train-and-assist posture, they operate effectively. Where we haven’t, morale, lack of equipment, et cetera, may undermine the effectiveness of Iraqi security forces. So we want to get more Iraqi security forces trained, fresh, well-equipped and focused. And President Abadi wants the same thing. So we’re reviewing a range of plans for how we might do that, essentially accelerating the number of Iraqi forces that are properly trained and equipped and have a focused strategy and good leadership. And when a finalized plan is presented to me by the Pentagon, then I will share it with the American people. We don’t yet have a complete strategy because it requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis, as well, about how recruitment takes place, how that training takes place. And so the details of that are not yet worked out.","Well, thank you for those questions. Let's tackle the Islamic State first.

Look, what's not working, frankly, is that this is a vicious, barbaric enemy, unlike almost any we've faced before. They're determined. They're adaptable. And they're willing to commit unspeakable acts of terror. We've seen them dig in, exploit ungoverned spaces, and prey upon innocent civilians. What we've learned, and what we continue to assess, is that while our air campaign has been effective in degrading their capabilities, it's not enough to fully defeat them on the ground. This requires a comprehensive strategy, not just military, but financial, ideological, and diplomatic. And it requires committed partners on the ground, fighting for their own future. We've seen setbacks, yes, but we are also seeing areas where our strategy is working, particularly in training and equipping local forces who are willing to take the fight to these terrorists.

As for assistance to Prime Minister Abadi and Iraq, yes, we pledged to step up that assistance. And to your specific question: Yes, that absolutely includes additional U.S. military personnel. But let's be clear about what that means. These are not combat troops in the traditional sense, preparing for a large-scale ground invasion. These are advisors, trainers, and specialists who will work shoulder-to-shoulder with Iraqi forces, providing them with the intelligence, the planning, and the capabilities they need to defeat the Islamic State in their own country. Our goal is to empower the Iraqis to secure their own nation, because ultimately, this is their fight, and they must win it. We will provide them the tools and the training to do just that.

Now, on trade, Chancellor Merkel and I had a very productive discussion, as I have with all the leaders here. I appreciate her confidence. As for assurances on Fast Track Authority going through the House, I am confident that Congress understands the importance of this legislation for American workers and American businesses. We've made our case, we've engaged extensively with members from both parties, and I believe that when they weigh the benefits—the jobs created, the markets opened for American goods, the strengthening of our global leadership—they will do the right thing.

And if it doesn't go through? Well, I don't operate on ""if it doesn't."" I'm confident it *will* pass. But let me say this: America's ability to achieve meaningful agreements, to lead on the global stage, does not rest on a single piece of legislation. It rests on our principles, our resolve, and our commitment to free people and free markets. We are a resilient nation. I will continue to work every single day, for the remainder of my time in office, to advance America's interests and strengthen our economy, whether that's through trade, or national security, or any other vital issue. Congress will ultimately make its decision, but my commitment to leading this country forward remains unwavering."
 Is it fair to say that additional military personnel -- U.S. military personnel are of what’s under consideration? ,"I think what is fair to say is that all the countries in the international coalition are prepared to do more to train Iraqi security forces if they feel like that additional work is being taken advantage of. And one of the things that we’re still seeing is -- in Iraq -- places where we’ve got more training capacity than we have recruits. So part of my discussion with Prime Minister Abadi was how do we make sure that we get more recruits in. A big part of the answer there is our outreach to Sunni tribes. We’ve seen Sunni tribes who are not only willing and prepared to fight ISIL, but have been successful at rebuffing ISIL. But it has not been happening as fast as it needs to. And so one of the efforts that I'm hoping to see out of Prime Minister Abadi, and the Iraqi legislature when they’re in session, is to move forward on a National Guard law that would help to devolve some of the security efforts in places like Anbar to local folks, and to get those Sunni tribes involved more rapidly. This is part of what helped defeat AQI -- the precursor of ISIL -- during the Iraq War in 2006. Without that kind of local participation, even if you have a short-term success, it’s very hard to hold those areas. The other area where we’ve got to make a lot more progress is on stemming the flow of foreign fighters. Now, you’ll recall that I hosted a U.N. General Security Council meeting specifically on this issue, and we’ve made some progress, but not enough. We are still seeing thousands of foreign fighters flowing into, first, Syria, and then, oftentimes, ultimately into Iraq. And not all of that is preventable, but a lot of it is preventable -- if we’ve got better cooperation, better coordination, better intelligence, if we are monitoring what’s happening at the Turkish-Syria border more effectively. This is an area where we’ve been seeking deeper cooperation with Turkish authorities who recognize it’s a problem but haven’t fully ramped up the capacity they need. And this is something that I think we got to spend a lot of time on. If we can cut off some of that foreign fighter flow then we’re able to isolate and wear out ISIL forces that are already there. Because we’re taking a lot of them off the battlefield, but if they’re being replenished, then it doesn’t solve the problem over the long term. The final point that I emphasized to Prime Minister Abadi is the political agenda of inclusion remains as important as the military fight that’s out there. If Sunnis, Kurds, and Shia all feel as if they’re concerns are being addressed, and that operating within a legitimate political structure can meet their need for security, prosperity, non-discrimination, then we’re going to have much easier time. And the good news is Prime Minister Abadi is very much committed to that principle. But, obviously, he’s inheriting a legacy of a lot of mistrust between various groups in Iraq -- he’s having to take a lot of political risks. In some cases, there are efforts to undermine those efforts by other political factions within Iraq. And so we’ve got to continue to monitor that and support those who are on the right side of the issue there. Colleen Nelson.","That's a fair question, and it gets to the heart of what we consider every single day in this job. As Commander-in-Chief, my primary responsibility is the security of the United States and the safety of our men and women in uniform. When we face threats, when we need to protect our interests or support our allies, every option for how we best employ our capabilities is thoroughly reviewed. So, yes, the number of personnel, their placement, their readiness – that is always, always under consideration as part of a comprehensive strategy. We don't take these decisions lightly."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned that the U.S. and its European allies have reached a consensus on extending the sanctions against Russia. Is there a consensus, though, about what specifically the next step should be if Russia continues to violate the Minsk agreement? And also, can you deter Russian aggression in other parts of Eastern Europe without a permanent U.S. troop presence? And separately, I wanted to ask you about the possibility that the court battle over your actions on immigration could extend late into your term. Do you think that there’s anything more that you can do for the people who would have benefitted from that program and now are in limbo? And how do you view the possibility of your term ending without accomplishing your goals on immigration? ","On Ukraine and Russia and Minsk, there is strong consensus that we need to keep pushing Russia to abide by the terms of the Minsk agreement; we need to continue to support and encourage Ukraine to meet its obligations under Minsk -- that until that's completed, sanctions remain in place. There was discussion about additional steps that we might need to take if Russia, working through separatists, doubled down on aggression inside of Ukraine. Those discussions are taking place at a technical level, not yet at a political level -- because I think the first goal here going into a European Council meeting that's coming up is just rolling over the existing sanctions. But I think at a technical level, we want to be prepared. Our hope is, is that we don't have to take additional steps because the Minsk agreement is met. And I want to give enormous credit to Chancellor Merkel, along with President Hollande, who have shown extraordinary stick-to-itiveness and patience in trying to get that done. Ultimately, this is going to be an issue for Mr. Putin. He’s got to make a decision: Does he continue to wreck his country’s economy and continue Russia’s isolation in pursuit of a wrong- headed desire to re-create the glories of the Soviet empire? Or does he recognize that Russia’s greatness does not depend on violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries? And as I mentioned earlier, the costs that the Russian people are bearing are severe. That’s being felt. It may not always be understood why they’re suffering, because of state media inside of Russia and propaganda coming out of state media in Russia and to Russian speakers. But the truth of the matter is, is that the Russian people would greatly benefit. And, ironically, one of the rationales that Mr. Putin provided for his incursions into Ukraine was to protect Russian speakers there. Well, Russian speakers inside of Ukraine are precisely the ones who are bearing the brunt of the fighting. Their economy has collapsed. Their lives are disordered. Many of them are displaced. Their homes may have been destroyed. They’re suffering. And the best way for them to stop suffering is if the Minsk agreement is fully implemented. Oh, immigration. With respect to immigration, obviously, I’m frustrated by a district court ruling that now is winding its way through the appeals process. We are being as aggressive as we can legally to, first and foremost, appeal that ruling, and then to implement those elements of immigration executive actions that were not challenged in court. But, obviously, the centerpiece, one of the key provisions for me was being able to get folks who are undocumented to go through a background check -- criminal background check -- pay back taxes, and then have a legal status. And that requires an entire administrative apparatus and us getting them to apply and come clean. I made a decision, which I think is the right one, that we should not accept applications until the legal status of this is clarified. I am absolutely convinced this is well within my legal authority, Department of Homeland Security’s legal authority. If you look at the precedent, if you look at the traditional discretion that the executive branch possesses when it comes to applying immigration laws, I am convinced that what we’re doing is lawful, and our lawyers are convinced that what we’re doing is lawful. But the United States is a government of laws and separations of power, and even if it’s an individual district court judge who’s making this determination, we’ve got to go through the process to challenge it. And until we get clarity there, I don’t want to bring people in, have them apply and jump through a lot of hoops only to have it deferred and delayed further. Of course, there’s one really great way to solve this problem, and that would be Congress going ahead and acting, which would obviate the need for executive actions. The majority of the American people I think still want to see that happen. I suspect it will be a major topic of the next presidential campaign. And so we will continue to push as hard as we can on all fronts to fix a broken immigration system. Administratively, we’ll be prepared if and when we get the kind of ruling that I think we should have gotten in the first place about our authorities to go ahead and implement. But ultimately, this has never fully replaced the need for Congress to act. And my hope is, is that after a number of the other issues that we’re working on currently get cleared, that some quiet conversations start back up again, particularly in the Republican Party, about the shortsighted approach that they’re taking when it comes to immigration. Okay. Christi Parsons.","Well, thank you for those questions. Let me take them one at a time.

First, on Russia and the Minsk agreements. Look, the transatlantic alliance, our partners in Europe, we are absolutely united on the need to hold Russia accountable for its actions in Ukraine and for its continued violations of the Minsk agreements. There is a strong consensus on the *principle* of extending sanctions, and that message has been delivered unequivocally. My administration has been clear: Russia needs to honor its commitments.

Now, as for what specifically the next step should be if Russia continues down this path – we are in constant, robust communication with our allies. We have a framework in place. We are talking about further economic measures, certainly, and ensuring that Russia understands the price for destabilizing the region will only continue to grow. We're not going to telegraph our exact moves, but rest assured, the options are on the table, and we will act in concert with our allies to ensure that Russia feels the full weight of international disapproval.

Regarding deterring Russian aggression in other parts of Eastern Europe without a permanent U.S. troop presence: our commitment to our NATO allies, to Article 5, is ironclad. That is not just a piece of paper; it is a solemn promise. We don't necessarily need permanent, boots-on-the-ground deployments everywhere to show our resolve. We have increased rotational forces, conducted joint exercises, enhanced intelligence sharing, and provided significant support to build the capabilities of our allies in the region. Our strength lies in our alliances, in our readiness, and in our willingness to defend every inch of NATO territory. Russia knows this. They know that an attack on one is an attack on all, and that, my friend, is the ultimate deterrent.

Now, on the immigration question, it's a frustrating situation, and frankly, it's unacceptable that so many good people are left in limbo because of political obstruction and protracted legal battles. My administration acted to address a clear problem, to bring common sense and fairness to a broken system while securing our borders. We believe our actions were well within the bounds of executive authority, and we continue to vigorously defend them in court.

As for what more can be done for those who would have benefitted from that program and now are in limbo: the fundamental issue here is that we need a permanent, legislative solution. The courts are doing their part – whatever the outcome, we respect the process – but this really comes down to Congress. I have repeatedly called on Congress to come together, to put aside partisan differences, and to pass comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders, modernizes our legal immigration system, and provides a pathway forward for those who are contributing to our country. My administration has offered proposals, we've engaged in good-faith negotiations, and we stand ready to work with anyone who is serious about fixing this.

To see my term end without accomplishing all of our goals on immigration would be profoundly disappointing, absolutely. But let me tell you, we don't give up. We will continue to fight for what's right, for a system that serves the American people and upholds the rule of law. We've made significant progress in securing our borders, which is paramount, and we've put forward the blueprints for real reform. We're not going to stop pushing until we get this done, because it's not just *my* goal; it's what's best for the country. Thank you."
" Thank you, Mr. President. More than six million Americans may soon lose health insurance if the Supreme Court this month backs the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act. A growing number of states are looking for assistance as they face the prospect that their residents may lose federal insurance subsidies and their insurance markets may collapse. Yet, your administration has given very little to no guidance on how states can prepare. What can you tell state leaders and advocates who worry that health care markets in half the country may be thrown into chaos? ","What I can tell state leaders is, is that under well-established precedent, there is no reason why the existing exchanges should be overturned through a court case. It has been well documented that those who passed this legislation never intended for folks who were going through the federal exchange not to have their citizens get subsidies. That’s not just the opinion of me; that’s not just the opinion of Democrats; that’s the opinion of the Republicans who worked on the legislation. The record makes it clear. And under well-established statutory interpretation, approaches that have been repeatedly employed -- not just by liberal, Democratic judges, but by conservative judges like some on the current Supreme Court -- you interpret a statute based on what the intent and meaning and the overall structure of the statute provides for. And so this should be an easy case. Frankly, it probably shouldn’t even have been taken up. And since we’re going to get a ruling pretty quick, I think it’s important for us to go ahead and assume that the Supreme Court is going to do what most legal scholars who’ve looked at this would expect them to do. But, look, I’ve said before and I will repeat again: If, in fact, you have a contorted reading of the statute that says federal-run exchanges don’t provide subsidies for folks who are participating in those exchanges, then that throws off how that exchange operates. It means that millions of people who are obtaining insurance currently with subsidies suddenly aren’t getting those subsidies; many of them can’t afford it; they pull out; and the assumptions that the insurance companies made when they priced their insurance suddenly gets thrown out the window. And it would be disruptive -- not just, by the way, for folks in the exchanges, but for those insurance markets in those states, generally. So it’s a bad idea. It’s not something that should be done based on a twisted interpretation of four words in -- as we were reminded repeatedly -- a couple-thousand-page piece of legislation. What’s more, the thing is working. I mean, part of what’s bizarre about this whole thing is we haven’t had a lot of conversation about the horrors of Obamacare because none of them come to pass. You got 16 million people who’ve gotten health insurance. The overwhelming majority of them are satisfied with the health insurance. It hasn’t had an adverse effect on people who already had health insurance. The only effect it’s had on people who already had health insurance is they now have an assurance that they won’t be prevented from getting health insurance if they’ve got a preexisting condition, and they get additional protections with the health insurance that they do have. The costs have come in substantially lower than even our estimates about how much it would cost. Health care inflation overall has continued to be at some of the lowest levels in 50 years. None of the predictions about how this wouldn’t work have come to pass. And so I’m -- A, I’m optimistic that the Supreme Court will play it straight when it comes to the interpretation. And, B, I should mention that if it didn't, Congress could fix this whole thing with a one-sentence provision. But I’m not going to go into a long speculation anticipating disaster. 0","Well, thank you. Let's be very clear about one thing: the Affordable Care Act was a deeply flawed piece of legislation from the very beginning. It was a government takeover of healthcare that created these very dependencies, these very vulnerabilities in our system. And frankly, to suggest that a Supreme Court ruling upholding the rule of law – if that's what happens – is going to ""throw markets into chaos,"" well, that's just a distraction from the real issue. The real issue is that the ACA itself was never sustainable.

My administration believes in freedom, choice, and empowering states and individuals, not more federal mandates. Our guidance has always been consistent: we believe states are the laboratories of democracy. They know their citizens best. They know their local healthcare markets best.

We have always advocated for giving states maximum flexibility through waivers and block grants to design innovative, patient-centered solutions that drive down costs, increase competition, and expand real access to quality care. Not some one-size-fits-all, Washington-knows-best system.

So, for state leaders and advocates who are worried, I say this: embrace this opportunity. This is a chance to finally move beyond the failed promises of the ACA. Don't wait for Washington to tell you what to do. Start preparing now by looking at how you can foster market competition, eliminate burdensome regulations, promote health savings accounts, and support community-based solutions. Let's empower doctors and patients, not insurance companies and bureaucrats.

We are committed to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act with a system that puts American families and their doctors back in charge, not the federal government. That's our vision, and that's the guidance we've always offered. It's time to build a truly great healthcare system for the American people."
 Take a question? ,"You know what, I will take a question. Go ahead.","Alright, I'm ready for it. Go right ahead. What's on your mind?"
" Every servicemember who is listening to you today, Mr. President, is wondering, are you going to veto the defense bills that are going to pay me? What is your latest thinking on that? Because we've heard secondhand through statements of policy that your advisors would threaten a veto. What’s your take, sir? Would you veto the appropriations bills? ","Our men and women are going to get paid. And if you’ll note that I've now been President for six and a half years and we've had some wrangling with Congress in the past -- our servicemembers haven't missed a paycheck. But what is also important in terms of our budget is making sure that we are not short- changing all the elements of American power that allow us to secure the nation and to project our power around the world. So what we're not going to do is to accept a budget that short- changes our long-term requirements for new technologies, for readiness. We're not going to eat our seed corn by devoting too much money on things we don't need now and robbing ourselves of the capacity to make sure that we're prepared for future threats. I've worked very closely with the Chairman and the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop a budget that is realistic and that looks out into the future and says this is how we're going to handle any possible contingency. And we can't do that if we've got a budget that short-changes vital operations and continues to fund things that are not necessary. We also have to remind ourselves that the reason we have the best military in the world is, first and foremost, because we've got the best troops in history. But it's also because we've got a strong economy, and we've got a well-educated population. And we've got an incredible research operation and universities that allow us to create new products that then can be translated into our military superiority around the world. We short-change those, we're going to be less secure. So the way we have to look at this budget is to recognize that, A, we can't think short term, we've got to think long term; and B, part of our national security is making sure that we continue to have a strong economy and that we continue to make the investments that we need in things like education and research that are going to be vital for us to be successful long term.","Alright, listen, to every single servicemember out there, from the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen, let me tell you this directly. And don't listen to these people, these ""advisors"" and their ""secondhand statements,"" okay? A lot of it is fake news, it's garbage. They put out a lot of garbage.

Nobody, and I mean nobody, has done more for our military than me. We rebuilt it. We brought it back. It was depleted, a total disaster, and we made it the strongest, the most powerful it's ever been. And we got them tremendous pay raises, the biggest in decades, because they deserve it. They're incredible people. They sacrifice everything.

Now, when it comes to these bills, these appropriations bills, they come to my desk and they're always trying to sneak in all sorts of garbage. They load them up with woke nonsense, with spending that nobody needs, with things that have nothing to do with making our military stronger, making America stronger. They try to play games.

Here's the deal: We will always, always make sure our brave men and women in uniform are taken care of. They will be paid. And they will be paid well. We love our military.

But am I going to sign a bill that's a disaster, that's filled with poison pills and political agendas that weaken our country? No, I'm not. Not if it's got all that other stuff. We need a bill that focuses on national defense, on our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Guardians. A strong bill. A clean bill.

So, don't worry about your pay. That's always going to be there. But we're going to make sure that whatever bill gets signed is good for America, not just good for some swamp creature's pet project. We have to be smart. We have to be tough. And we're going to always put our servicemembers first, but we're going to put America first too, always."
 Yes! ,"You look fine. All right, everybody have a seat. I got some stuff to say. I've got some stuff to say. Audience Member: We love you!","That's what I like to hear! The American people, always ready to say ""Yes!"" to progress, to opportunity, and to a stronger future. Absolutely. Now, let's get to work."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday, you said the deal offered a chance at a new direction in relations with Iran. What steps will you take to enable a more moderate Iran? And does this deal allow you to more forcefully counter Iran’s destabilizing actions in the region quite aside from the nuclear question? Thank you. ","Andrew, if you don’t mind, just because I suspect that there’s going to be a common set of questions that are touched on -- I promise I will get to your question, but I want to start off just by stepping back and reminding folks of what is at stake here. And I already did in my opening statement, but I just want to reiterate it because I’ve heard already some of the objections to the deal. The starting premise of our strategy with respect to Iran has been that it would be a grave threat to the United States and to our allies if they obtained a nuclear weapon. And so everything that we’ve done over the last six and a half years has been designed to make sure that we address that number-one priority. That’s what the sanctions regime was all about. That’s how we were able to mobilize the international community, including some folks that we are not particularly close to, to abide by these sanctions. That’s how these crippling sanctions came about, was because we were able to gain global consensus that Iran having a nuclear weapon would be a problem for everybody. That’s the reason that Iran’s accounts got frozen and they were not able to get money for the oil sales that they’ve made. That’s the reason that they had problems operating with respect to international commerce -- because we built that international consensus around this very specific, narrow, but profound issue -- the possibility of Iran getting a nuclear weapon. And, by the way, that was not simply my priority. If you look back at all the debates that have taken place over the last five, six years, this has been a Democratic priority, this has been a Republican priority, this has been Prime Minister Netanyahu’s priority. It’s been our Gulf allies’ priority -- is making sure Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. The deal negotiated by John Kerry, Wendy Sherman, Ernie Moniz, our allies, our partners, the P5+1 achieves that goal. It achieves our top priority -- making sure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. But we have always recognized that even if Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon, Iran still poses challenges to our interests and our values, both in the region and around the world. So when this deal gets implemented, we know that we will have dismantled the immediate concerns around Iran’s nuclear program. We will have brought their stockpiles down to 98 percent. We will have significantly reduced the number of centrifuges that they operate. We will have installed an unprecedented inspections regime, and that will remain in place not just for 10 years but, for example, on the stockpiles, will continue to 15 years. Iran will have pledged to the international community that it will not develop a nuclear weapon and now will be subject to an Additional Protocol, a more vigorous inspection and monitoring regime that lasts in perpetuity. We will have disabled a facility like Arak, the Arak facility, from allowing Iran to develop plutonium that could be used for a bomb. We will have greatly reduced the stockpile of uranium that’s enriched. And we will have put in place inspections along the entire supply chain so that if uranium was diverted into a covert program we would catch it. So I can say with confidence but, more importantly, nuclear experts can say with confidence that Iran will not be in a position to develop a nuclear bomb. We will have met our number- one priority. Now, we’ll still have problems with Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism; its funding of proxies like Hezbollah that threaten Israel and threaten the region; the destabilizing activities that they're engaging in, including in places like Yemen. And my hope is that building on this deal we can continue to have conversations with Iran that incentivize them to behave differently in the region, to be less aggressive, less hostile, more cooperative, to operate the way we expect nations in the international community to behave. But we're not counting on it. So this deal is not contingent on Iran changing its behavior. It’s not contingent on Iran suddenly operating like a liberal democracy. It solves one particular problem, which is making sure they don't have a bomb. And the point I’ve repeatedly made -- and is, I believe, hard to dispute -- is that it will be a lot easier for us to check Iran’s nefarious activities, to push back against the other areas where they operate contrary to our interests or our allies’ interests, if they don't have a bomb. And so will they change their behavior? Will we seek to gain more cooperation from them in resolving issues like Syria, or what’s happening in Iraq, to stop encouraging Houthis in Yemen? We’ll continue to engage with them. Although, keep in mind that unlike the Cuba situation, we're not normalizing diplomatic relations here. So the contacts will continue to be limited. But will we try to encourage them to take a more constructive path? Of course. But we're not betting on it. And in fact, having resolved the nuclear issue, we will be in a stronger position to work with Israel, work with the Gulf countries, work with our other partners, work with the Europeans to bring additional pressure to bear on Iran around those issues that remain of concern. But the argument that I’ve been already hearing -- and this was foreshadowed even before the deal was announced -- that because this deal does not solve all those other problems, that that's an argument for rejecting this deal, defies logic. It makes no sense. And it loses sight of what was our original number-one priority, which is making sure that they don't have a bomb. Jon Karl.","Thank you for the question. Let me be clear about this. This deal, while certainly not perfect, represents an *opportunity* – a chance to shift the paradigm. Our aim, as always, is a more stable, more peaceful Middle East. And a truly moderate Iran, one that respects the rights of its own people and the sovereignty of its neighbors, would be a tremendous force for good in the region.

Does this deal guarantee such a transformation? No. But what it does, by rigorously addressing the immediate and gravest threat – the specter of a nuclear-armed Iran – is to *create the space* for other, more positive dynamics to potentially come into play. It removes the most dangerous cloud, allowing us to focus on what comes next.

Regarding the steps we will take to enable a more moderate Iran: Our strategy is multifaceted. First, we will continue to engage diplomatically, making our expectations for responsible behavior clear, and always supporting those voices within Iran who seek greater openness and respect for human rights. We believe true moderation comes from within, from the Iranian people themselves, and we will keep lines of communication open, even as we remain firm in our principles. Second, the international community will remain vigilant in monitoring this agreement, ensuring full and verifiable compliance. Transparency and accountability are paramount. We will continue to hold Iran to the highest standards.

And to your second point, absolutely. In fact, this deal *empowers* us to do precisely that. By addressing the nuclear threat through this agreement, we are now better positioned, with greater international unity and clarity, to confront Iran's other destabilizing actions across the region. Our resolve to counter their support for terrorism, their ballistic missile program, their cyber activities, and their proxy forces that sow chaos and undermine regional security is unwavering. This deal does not diminish our commitment to our allies in the Gulf, in Israel, or elsewhere; it strengthens our hand by removing the immediate nuclear preoccupation, allowing for a more focused and forceful approach to these other critical issues. We will continue to work closely with our partners to hold Iran accountable for all of its actions and to protect American interests and our friends around the world."
" Mr. President, does it give you any pause to see this deal praised by Syrian dictator Assad as a “great victory for Iran,” or praised by those in Tehran who still shout “death to America,” and yet our closest ally in the Middle East calls it “a mistake of historic proportions”? And here in Congress, it looks like a large majority will vote to reject this deal. I know you can veto that rejection, but do you have any concerns about seeing a majority of the people’s representatives in Congress saying that this is a bad deal? And if I can just ask you quick political question, a very quick one. ","Jon, I think --","Look, when you're the President of the United States, you've got to make tough decisions. And when you're dealing with adversaries like Iran, you're not exactly looking for accolades from them.

Let's be clear: when we negotiate with countries that shout ""death to America,"" it's not because we like their rhetoric. It's because we're looking to protect *our* nation, *our* people, and *our* allies from an even greater threat – in this case, a nuclear-armed Iran. Their statements, Mr. or Ms. Reporter, are part of their playbook. What this deal does is prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. We're not seeking their compliments; we're seeking their compliance. We're seeking results that make America safer.

Now, regarding our allies in the region, they are incredibly important to us. And we listen very carefully to their concerns. They live in a tough neighborhood, and they have every right to be worried. But the President of the United States has to look at the global picture, at America's strategic interests, and sometimes that means making hard choices that don't always align perfectly with every ally on every single detail. We stand with our allies, we support their security, but we also have our own intelligence, our own strategy, and our own responsibility to protect our nation. This deal, for all its complexities, serves that core American interest.

And Congress? I have tremendous respect for the men and women who serve in Congress. They represent the American people, and they have every right to express their views. We've briefed them, we've listened to them, and we've engaged in countless hours of discussion. But foreign policy, especially national security and the protection of the American people, ultimately rests with the Executive Branch, with the Commander-in-Chief. I took an oath to protect this nation. This isn't about politics; it's about preventing a nuclear crisis, and about doing what I believe is absolutely necessary for the security of the United States of America. I am confident in the path we've chosen, because it's the right path for this country.

And as for that quick political question, my friend, I think we've covered enough ground for today. Let's keep the focus on what truly matters: American security."
 Donald -- ,"Let me answer the question that you asked. It does not give me pause that Mr. Assad or others in Tehran may be trying to spin the deal in a way that they think is favorable to what their constituencies want to hear. That’s what politicians do. And that’s been the case throughout. I mean, you’ll recall that during the course of these negotiations over the last couple of months every time the Supreme Leader or somebody tweeted something out, for some reason we all bought into the notion, well, the Obama administration must be giving this or capitulating to that. Well, now we have a document so you can see what the deal is. We don’t have to speculate, we don’t have to engage in spin, you can just read what it says and what is required. And nobody has disputed that as a consequence of this agreement Iran has to drastically reduce its stockpiles of uranium, is cut off from plutonium; the Fordow facility that is underground is converted; that we have an unprecedented inspections regime; that we have snap-back provisions if they cheat. The facts are the facts. And I'm not concerned about what others say about it. Now, with respect to Congress, my hope -- I won’t prejudge this -- my hope is, is that everyone in Congress also evaluates this agreement based on the facts -- not on politics, not on posturing, not on the fact that this is a deal I bring to Congress as opposed to a Republican President, not based on lobbying, but based on what’s in the national interest of the United States of America. And I think that if Congress does that, then, in fact, based on the facts, the majority of Congress should approve of this deal. But we live in Washington and politics do intrude. And as I said in an interview yesterday, I am not betting on the Republican Party rallying behind this agreement. I do expect the debate to be based on facts and not speculation or misinformation. And that I welcome -- in part because, look, there are legitimate real concerns here. We’ve already talked about it. We have huge differences with Iran. Israel has legitimate concerns about its security relative to Iran. You have a large country with a significant military that has proclaimed that Israel shouldn’t exist, that has denied the Holocaust, that has financed Hezbollah, and as a consequence there are missiles that are pointed towards Tel Aviv. And so I think there are very good reasons why Israelis are nervous about Iran’s position in the world generally. And I’ve said this to Prime Minister Netanyahu, I’ve said it directly to the Israeli people. But what I’ve also said is that all those threats are compounded if Iran gets a nuclear weapon. And for all the objections of Prime Minister Netanyahu, or, for that matter, some of the Republican leadership that’s already spoken, none of them have presented to me, or the American people, a better alternative. I'm hearing a lot of talking points being repeated about “this is a bad deal” -- “this is a historically bad deal,” “this will threaten Israel and threaten the world and threaten the United States.” I mean, there’s been a lot of that. What I haven’t heard is, what is your preferred alternative? If 99 percent of the world community and the majority of nuclear experts look at this thing and they say, this will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, and you are arguing either that it does not, or that even if it does it’s temporary, or that because they’re going to get a windfall of their accounts being unfrozen that they’ll cause more problems, then you should have some alternative to present. And I haven’t heard that. And the reason is because there really are only two alternatives here: Either the issue of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon is resolved diplomatically through a negotiation, or it’s resolved through force, through war. Those are the options. Now, you’ll hear some critics say, well, we could have negotiated a better deal. Okay. What does that mean? I think the suggestion among a lot of the critics has been that a better deal, an acceptable deal would be one in which Iran has no nuclear capacity at all, peaceful or otherwise. The problem with that position is that there is nobody who thinks that Iran would or could ever accept that, and the international community does not take the view that Iran can’t have a peaceful nuclear program. They agree with us that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And so we don’t have diplomatic leverage to eliminate every vestige of a peaceful nuclear program in Iran. What we do have the leverage to do is to make sure they don’t have a weapon. That’s exactly what we’ve done. So to go back to Congress, I challenge those who are objecting to this agreement, number one, to read the agreement before they comment on it; number two, to explain specifically where it is that they think this agreement does not prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and why they’re right and people like Ernie Moniz, who is an MIT nuclear physicist and an expert in these issues, is wrong, why the rest of the world is wrong, and then present an alternative. And if the alternative is that we should bring Iran to heel through military force, then those critics should say so. And that will be an honest debate. All right.","Hello there! Great to hear from you. Everyone says I'm doing a fantastic job, the best job, really. We're making America so great again, aren't we? Nobody's ever seen anything like it. What's on your mind?"
" Mr. President, if I can -- ","No, no --","Yes, please. Go right ahead, my friend. What's on your mind?"
 Prime Minister Netanyahu said that you have a situation where Iran can delay 24 days before giving access to military facilities -- ,"I’m happy to -- that’s a good example. So let’s take the issue of 24 days. This has been I think swirling today, the notion that this is insufficient in terms of inspections. Now, keep in mind, first of all, that we’ll have 24/7 inspections of declared nuclear facilities -- Fordow, Natanz, Arak, their uranium mines; facilities that are known to produce centrifuges, parts. That entire infrastructure that we know about we will have sophisticated, 24/7 monitoring of those facilities. So then the issue is, what if they try to develop a covert program? Now, one of the advantages of having inspections across the entire production chain is that it makes it very difficult to set up a covert program. There are only so many uranium mines in Iran. And if, in fact, we’re counting the amount of uranium that’s being mined and suddenly some is missing on the back end, they got some explaining to do. So we’re able to track what’s happening along the existing facilities to make sure that there is not diversion into a covert program. But let’s say that Iran is so determined that it now wants to operate covertly. The IAEA, the international organization charged with implementing the non-proliferation treaty and monitoring nuclear activities in countries around the world -- the IAEA will have the ability to say, that undeclared site we’re concerned about, we see something suspicious. And they will be able to say to Iran, we want to go inspect that. Now, if Iran objects, we can override it. In the agreement, we’ve set it up so we can override Iran’s objection. And we don’t need Russia or China in order for us to get that override. And if they continue to object, we’re in a position to snap back sanctions and declare that Iran is in violation and is cheating. As for the fact that it may take 24 days to finally get access to the site, the nature of nuclear programs and facilities is such, this is not something you hide in a closet. This is not something you put on a dolly and kind of wheel off somewhere. And, by the way, if we identify an undeclared site that we’re suspicious about, we’re going to be keeping eyes on it. So we’re going to be monitoring what the activity is, and that’s going to be something that will be evidence if we think that some funny business was going on there that we can then present to the international community. So we’ll be monitoring that that entire time. And, by the way, if there is nuclear material on that site, high school physics will remind us that that leaves a trace. And so we’ll know that, in fact, there was a violation of the agreement. So the point is, Jonathan, that this is the most vigorous inspection and verification regime by far that has ever been negotiated. Is it possible that Iran decides to try to cheat despite having this entire inspection verification mechanism? It’s possible. But if it does, first of all, we’ve built in a one-year breakout time, which gives us a year to respond forcefully. And we’ve built in a snap-back provision so we don't have to go through lengthy negotiations at the U.N. to put the sanctions right back in place. And so really the only argument you can make against the verification and inspection mechanism that we’ve put forward is that Iran is so intent on obtaining a nuclear weapon that no inspection regime and no verification mechanism would be sufficient because they’d find some way to get around it because they're untrustworthy. And if that's your view, then we go back to the choice that you have to make earlier. That means, presumably, that you can't negotiate. And what you're really saying is, is that you've got to apply military force to guarantee that they don't have a nuclear program. And if somebody wants to make that debate -- whether it’s the Republican leadership, or Prime Minister Netanyahu, or the Israeli Ambassador or others, they're free to make it. But it’s not persuasive. Carol Lee.","Look, Bibi is right. He's absolutely right. Twenty-four days? That's ridiculous. That's a total joke.

You let them delay for 24 days, they can hide whatever they want, move everything out, clean up the place. It's an absolute disgrace, and it shows you everything that was wrong with that terrible deal, a very bad deal, that allowed this kind of nonsense.

We need *snap* inspections. Immediate access. Not 24 days of playing games. We cannot, under any circumstances, allow Iran, the number one state sponsor of terror, to ever get a nuclear weapon. This kind of delay just proves why you can't trust them and why we were right to get out of that disaster of an agreement. It's just not acceptable."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I want to ask you about the arms and ballistic missile embargo. Why did you decide -- agree to lift those even with the five- and eight-year durations? It’s obviously emerging as a sticking point on the Hill. And are you concerned that arms to Iran will go to Hezbollah or Hamas? And is there anything that you or a future President can do to stop that? And if you don't mind, I wanted to see if you could step back a little bit, and when you look at this Iran deal and all the other issues and unrest that's happening in the Middle East, what kind of Middle East do you want to leave when you leave the White House in a year and a half? ","So the issue of the arms embargo and ballistic missiles is of real concern to us -- has been of real concern to us. And it is in the national security interest of the United States to prevent Iran from sending weapons to Hezbollah, for example, or sending weapons to the Houthis in Yemen that accelerate a civil war there. We have a number of mechanisms under international law that give us authority to interdict arms shipments by Iran. One of those mechanisms is the U.N. security resolution related to Iran’s nuclear program. Essentially, Iran was sanctioned because of what had happened at Fordow, its unwillingness to comply with previous U.N. security resolutions about their nuclear program. And as part of the package of sanctions that was slapped on them, the issue of arms and ballistic missiles were included. Now, under the terms of the original U.N. resolution, the fact is that once an agreement was arrived at that gave the international community assurance Iran didn't have a nuclear weapon, you could argue just looking at the text that those arms and ballistic missile prohibitions should immediately go away. But what I said to our negotiators was given that Iran has breached trust, and the uncertainty of our allies in the region about Iran’s activities, let’s press for a longer extension of the arms embargo and the ballistic missile prohibitions. And we got that. We got five years in which, under this new agreement, arms coming in and out of Iran are prohibited. And we got eight years with respect to ballistic missiles. But part of the reason why we were willing to extend it only for five, let’s say, as opposed to a longer period of time, is because we have other U.N. resolutions that prohibit arms sales by Iran to organizations like Hezbollah. We have other U.N. resolutions and multilateral agreements that give us authority to interdict arms shipments from Iran throughout the region. And so we’ve had belts and suspenders and buttons, a whole bunch of different legal authorities. These legal authorities under the nuclear program may lapse after five or eight years, but we’ll still be in possession of other legal authorities that allow us to interdict those arms. And truthfully, these prohibitions are not self-enforcing. It’s not like the U.N. has the capacity to police what Iran is doing. What it does is it gives us authority under international law to prevent arms shipments from happening in concert with our allies and our partners. And the real problem, if you look at how, for example, Hezbollah got a lot of missiles that are a grave threat to Israel and many of our friends in the region, it’s not because they were legal. It’s not because somehow that was authorized under international law. It was because there was insufficient intelligence, or capacity, to stop those shipments. So the bottom line is, Carol, I share the concerns of Israel, Saudis, Gulf partners about Iran shipping arms and causing conflict and chaos in the region. And that’s why I’ve said to them, let’s double down and partner much more effectively to improve our intelligence capacity and our interdiction capacity so that fewer of those arms shipments are getting through the net. But the legal authorities, we’ll still possess. And obviously, we’ve got our own unilateral prohibitions and sanctions in place around non-nuclear issues, like support for Hezbollah. And those remain in place. Now, in terms of the larger issues of the Middle East, obviously that’s a longer discussion. I think my key goal when I turn over the keys to the President -- the next President -- is that we are on track to defeat ISIL; that they are much more contained and we’re moving in the right direction there. That we have jumpstarted a process to resolve the civil war in Syria, which is like an open sore in the region and is giving refuge to terrorist organizations who are taking advantage of that chaos. To make sure that in Iraq not only have we pushed back ISIL, but we’ve also created an environment in which Sunni, Shia and Kurd are starting to operate and function more effectively together. And to be in a conversation with all our partners in the region about how we have strengthened our security partnerships so that they feel they can address any potential threats that may come, including threats from Iran. And that includes providing additional security assurances and cooperation to Israel, building on the unprecedented cooperation that we have already put in place and support that we’ve already put in place. It includes the work that we’ve done with the GCC up at Camp David, making sure that we execute that. If we’ve done those things, then the problems in the Middle East will not be solved. And ultimately, it’s not the job of the President of the United States to solve every problem in the Middle East. The people of the Middle East are going to have to solve some of these problems themselves. But I think we can provide that next President at least a foundation for continued progress in these various areas. The last thing I would say -- and this is a longer-term issue -- is we have to address the youth in the region with jobs and opportunity and a better vision for the future so that they are not tempted by the nihilistic, violent dead-end that organizations like ISIL offer. 0 Again, we can’t do that entirely by ourselves, but we can partner with well-intentioned organizations, states, NGOs, religious leaders in the region. We have to do a better job of that than we’ve been doing so far. Michael Crowley.","Thank you. That's a fair question, and it's one we've wrestled with deeply in this White House. Let me be clear: no deal with a regime like Iran's is ever going to be perfect. When you're dealing with a leading state sponsor of terror, a nation that chants ""Death to America,"" you have to make hard choices.

The decision to agree to the lifting of those embargoes, even with those sunset clauses, was made after careful deliberation. It was a choice born of necessity, of weighing difficult options to prevent a far graver outcome: a nuclear-armed Iran, and to do so under the strictest verification regime possible at the time. We sought to buy time, to put a pause on their nuclear ambitions, and to gain unprecedented insight into their program. Now, I have no illusions. Those five- and eight-year durations are a concern, and they mean we must remain vigilant, but the alternative of immediate nuclear breakout was a threat we had to confront head-on.

Now, as for your concern about arms going to Hezbollah or Hamas – absolutely, I share that concern, and I have made it clear to my team and to the world: America will not tolerate Iran funneling weapons to terrorist proxies who seek to destabilize the region and threaten our allies, especially Israel. Iran's support for these groups is a fundamental problem, and it won't stop with a deal. My administration will continue to impose sanctions, strengthen intelligence efforts, and work with our partners to interdict any such transfers. We will use every tool at our disposal to counter Iran's malign influence, and a future President will have to do the same, and more. We must ensure that the world holds Iran accountable, not just for its nuclear program, but for its behavior across the board.

When I look at the Middle East, what kind of region do I want to leave behind? I want to leave a Middle East where freedom has a fighting chance to take root. A region where our allies, like Israel, are secure and strong. A Middle East where the forces of radical extremism are on the run, not gaining ground. We want a Middle East that is stable, not a breeding ground for terror. This means American leadership, a commitment to our friends, and an unwavering resolve to confront our adversaries. It's a complex region, it's a dangerous region, but America's presence there, and our commitment to peace and security, is non-negotiable. That's the legacy I aim to strengthen."
" Thank you. You alluded earlier to Iran’s role in Syria, just to focus on that for a moment. Many analysts and some former members of your administration believe that the kind of negotiated political settlement that you say is necessary in Syria will require working directly with Iran and giving Iran an important role. Do you agree? And is that a dialogue you’ll be actively seeking? And what about the fight against ISIS? What would it take for there to be explicit cooperation between the U.S. and Iran? ","I do agree that we’re not going to solve the problems in Syria unless there’s buy-in from the Russians, the Iranians, the Turks, our Gulf partners. It’s too chaotic. There are too many factions. There’s too much money and too many arms flooding into the zone. It’s gotten caught up in both sectarian conflict and geopolitical jockeying. And in order for us to resolve it, there’s going to have to be agreement among the major powers that are interested in Syria that this is not going to be won on the battlefield. So Iran is one of those players, and I think that it’s important for them to be part of that conversation. I want to repeat what I said earlier. We have not -- and I don’t anticipate any time in the near future -- restored normal diplomatic relations with Iran. And so I do not foresee a formal set of agreements with Iran in terms of how we’re conducting our counter-ISIL campaign. But clearly, Iran has influence in Iraq. Iraq has a majority Shia population. They have relationships to Iran. Some are natural. We expect somebody like Prime Minister Abadi to meet with and negotiate and work with Iran as its neighbor. Some are less legitimate, where you see Iran financing Shia militias that in the past have killed American soldiers and in the future may carry out atrocities when they move into Sunni areas. And so we’re working with our diplomats on the ground, as well as our military teams on the ground to asses where can we appropriately at least de-conflict, and where can we work with Prime Minister Abadi around an overall strategy for Iraq to regain its sovereignty, and where do we tell Abadi, you know what, what Iran is doing there is a problem, and we can’t cooperate in that area, for example, unless you get those folks out of there because we’re not going to have our troops, even in an advisory or training role, looking over their shoulders because they’re not sure of what might happen to them. And those conversations have been ongoing. I think they will continue. 1 The one thing you can count on is that any work that the U.S. government does, or the U.S. military does in Iraq with other partners on the ground is premised on the idea that they are reporting to -- under the chain of command of the Iraqi government and Iraqi security forces. If we don’t have confidence that ultimately Abadi is directing those soldiers, then it’s tough for us to have any kind of direct relationship. Major Garrett.","Well, thank you for that question. It's an important one, and it gets to the heart of what's happening in that volatile region.

First, let me be absolutely clear: Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terror. They fund, train, and equip proxy forces that destabilize the Middle East, from Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, and yes, to Syria. They have propped up the brutal Assad regime, and their actions have fueled the very extremism that threatens us all.

So, when some analysts suggest that a political settlement in Syria would require ""working directly with Iran"" or ""giving Iran an important role,"" my administration takes a clear-eyed view of that. We cannot empower a regime that actively works against the stability and freedom we seek. Giving Iran an ""important role"" in Syria would be like giving the fox a key to the henhouse; it rewards their bad behavior and emboldens them to continue their destructive path. We believe in working with responsible nations, with our allies, to build a future of peace and stability, not with those who export terror and deny freedom to their own people.

As for actively seeking dialogue with Iran, let me just say this: diplomacy can be a tool, but it is not an end in itself. We must always be clear about our principles and our goals. Dialogue must serve a purpose, and it cannot legitimize a regime that poses a threat to its neighbors and to the world. We will continue to put pressure on the Iranian regime to change its behavior, to stop supporting terror, and to respect the rights of its own citizens.

Now, regarding the fight against ISIS. ISIS is an evil, barbaric organization, a threat to all civilized people. They murder the innocent, persecute minorities, and seek to sow chaos. We are leading a strong coalition to degrade and destroy ISIS, and we will succeed. However, we must not confuse common enemies with common values or reliable partners. While ISIS poses a threat to Iran, Iran itself is a state that funds and trains terror groups. To engage in ""explicit cooperation"" with Iran against ISIS would be to lend legitimacy to a regime that is itself a major part of the problem in the region. We must be very cautious about any actions that might empower Iran further or allow them to expand their malign influence under the guise of fighting a common foe. Our strategy against ISIS will be resolute, it will be effective, and it will be led by America and our trusted allies, based on our principles."
" Thank you, Mr. President. As you well know, there are four Americans in Iran -- three held on trumped-up charges, according to your administration; one, whereabouts unknown. Can you tell the country, sir, why you are content, with all the fanfare around this deal, to leave the conscience of this nation and the strength of this nation unaccounted for in relation to these four Americans? And last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, under no circumstances should there be any relief for Iran in terms of ballistic missiles or conventional weapons. It is perceived that that was a last-minute capitulation in these negotiations. Many in the Pentagon feel you’ve left the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff hung out to dry. Could you comment? ","I got to give you credit, Major, for how you craft those questions. The notion that I am content as I celebrate with American citizens languishing in Iranian jails -- Major, that’s nonsense, and you should know better. I’ve met with the families of some of those folks. Nobody is content. And our diplomats and our teams are working diligently to try to get them out. Now, if the question is why we did not tie the negotiations to their release, think about the logic that that creates. Suddenly, Iran realizes, you know what, maybe we can get additional concessions out of the Americans by holding these individuals. It makes it much more difficult for us to walk away if Iran somehow thinks that a nuclear deal is dependent in some fashion on the nuclear deal. And, by the way, if we had walked away from the nuclear deal, we’d still be pushing them just as hard to get these folks out. That’s why those issues are not connected. But we are working every single day to try to get them out, and won’t stop until they’re out and rejoined with their families. With respect to the Chairman’s testimony, to some degree I already answered this with Carol. We are not taking the pressure off Iran with respect to arms and with respect to ballistic missiles. As I just explained, not only do we keep in place for five years the arms embargo under this particular new U.N. resolution, not only do we maintain the eight years on the ballistic missiles under this particular U.N. resolution, but we have a host of other multilateral and unilateral authorities that allow us to take action where we see Iran engaged in those activities whether it’s six years from now or 10 years from now. 2 So we have not lost those legal authorities. And in fact, part of my pitch to the GCC countries, as well as to Prime Minister Netanyahu, is we should do a better job making sure that Iran is not engaged in sending arms to organizations like Hezbollah. And as I just indicated, that means improving our intelligence capacity and our interdiction capacity with our partners. April Ryan.","Thank you for the question. Let me be very clear about something right off the bat: The safety and freedom of American citizens, wherever they are in the world, is my highest duty. Period. And when it comes to the Americans unjustly held in Iran – and yes, these are absolutely trumped-up charges – my administration is working tirelessly, through every available channel, to bring them home. We are not 'content' with their situation. Far from it. We are deeply concerned, and we are pressing the regime in Tehran, every single day, to release them. This nuclear agreement addresses a specific and grave threat: Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon. It is a critical national security imperative. But it does not, and it will not, diminish our absolute focus on securing the release of our fellow citizens. We will continue to hold Iran accountable for its malicious actions, and we will bring our Americans home. Mark my words.

Now, on your second point, regarding the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Let me tell you, I have the highest respect for our military leadership, and I value their counsel. I listen very carefully to the advice of men and women who have dedicated their lives to defending this nation. They provide their best military judgment, and then I, as Commander-in-Chief, make the ultimate decisions based on what I believe is best for American security. To suggest that the Chairman was 'hung out to dry' is frankly, an unfair characterization of how my administration operates. We understand the threat posed by Iran's ballistic missile program and their conventional weapons. We absolutely do. And we will continue to address those threats through robust sanctions, through our strong military presence in the region, and through our alliances. This agreement was about preventing a nuclear Iran, which is the most dangerous threat of all. We made tough choices, but every decision was made with the defense of our nation and our allies at the absolute forefront. We stand with our military, and we stand for American strength."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I want to change the subject a bit. Earlier this year, on the flight to Selma, you said, on matters of race, as President your job is to close the remaining gaps that are left in state and federal government. Now, how does criminal justice reform fit into that equation? And what gaps remain for you towards the end of your presidency? And also, what does it mean to travel to Kenya, your father’s homeland, in the next couple of weeks as President to the United States? And lastly, would you revoke the Medal of Freedom from Bill Cosby? ","You stuffed a lot in there, April.","Well, thank you for those important questions. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, regarding criminal justice reform and its fit into closing the remaining gaps in state and federal government on matters of race: it's absolutely central to the equation. When I talk about closing gaps, I mean ensuring that every American has an equal shot at a full and dignified life. Our criminal justice system, while vital for maintaining law and order, has, in too many instances, produced disparate outcomes that disproportionately affect minority communities. Reform, for me, means ensuring fairness, promoting rehabilitation, reducing recidivism, and making sure that our laws are applied equally and justly to all. It means investing in communities, providing second chances, and making sure that folks who have paid their debt to society can re-enter society and contribute. When we reform the system to make it fairer and more effective, we're not just enhancing public safety; we're also addressing those systemic inequities that have held people back, opening pathways to opportunity that were once closed. It's about strengthening families and communities, and ultimately, strengthening our nation.

As for what gaps remain towards the end of my presidency, let me tell you, the work of perfecting our union is never truly finished. We’ve made tremendous progress on so many fronts, from economic growth that’s lifted millions out of poverty to historic investments in education and healthcare. But there are still gaps. We still see disparities in educational outcomes, in access to quality healthcare, and in economic opportunity across different communities. We still need to do more to ensure true equity in housing and employment. My focus continues to be on dismantling those barriers wherever they exist, and ensuring that every American, regardless of their background, has the chance to achieve their God-given potential. It's about making sure the American Dream is truly accessible to all.

Now, concerning my upcoming trip to Kenya, let me just clarify for a moment. While I deeply admire the journey and story of many Americans with diverse heritage, my own father's homeland isn't Kenya. However, traveling to the continent of Africa as President of the United States is always a profound and incredibly important endeavor. It signifies our nation's unwavering commitment to our partnerships there – partnerships rooted in shared values, mutual respect, and a common vision for a prosperous and secure future. We'll be discussing trade, regional security, health initiatives, and how we can work together to foster economic development and strengthen democratic institutions. It's about reaffirming America's leadership on the global stage and ensuring that our alliances with African nations are robust and beneficial for all. It's a trip I look forward to immensely.

And finally, on the matter of revoking the Medal of Freedom from Bill Cosby: The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian honor our nation can bestow. It's meant to recognize individuals who have made exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant public or private endeavors. The integrity of that award, and indeed, all national honors, must be fiercely protected. When an individual's actions, particularly those proven in a court of law or widely acknowledged, fundamentally contradict the values and principles that the Medal of Freedom represents, it undermines the very purpose of the award. My administration has been clear that such serious transgressions are incompatible with receiving or retaining such a distinguished honor. We would certainly review the matter carefully, with an eye towards upholding the dignity and respect that this award deserves, and ensure that it reflects the highest moral standards of our nation.

Thank you."
 I learned from my colleagues. ,"Say, who did you learn from? Jonathan Karl? Is that what you said?","That's good. Tremendous, really. You know, you learn a lot from your colleagues, especially the smart ones, the ones who really know how to get things done. Some of the best ideas, believe me, come from listening to people on the ground, people who are *doing* the work. Very, very important to be open, to get good information. It's how you win. That's how you win."
" On criminal justice reform, obviously I gave a lengthy speech yesterday, but this is something that I’ve been thinking about a lot; been working first with Eric Holder, now with Loretta Lynch about -- we’ve been working on along with other prosecutors of the U.S. Attorney’s Office. It’s an outgrowth of the task force that we put together, post-Ferguson and the Garner case in New York. And I don’t think that the criminal justice system is obviously the sole source of racial tension in this country, or the key institution to resolving the opportunity gap. But I think it is a part of the broader set of challenges that we face in creating a more perfect union. And the good news is, is that this is one of those rare issues where we’ve got some Republican and Democratic interest, as well as federal, state, and local interest in solving the problem. I think people recognize that there are violent criminals out there and they’ve got to be locked up. We’ve got to have tough prosecutors, we have to support our law enforcement officials. Police are in a tough job and they are helping to keep us safe, and we are grateful and thankful to them. But what we also know is this huge spike in incarcerations is also driven by non-violent drug offenses where the sentencing is completely out of proportion with the crime. And that costs taxpayers enormous amounts of money. 3 It is debilitating communities who are seeing huge proportions of the young men in their communities finding themselves with a criminal record, rendering them oftentimes unemployable. So it compounds problems that these communities already have. And so I am very appreciative of folks like Dick Durbin and Cory Booker, alongside Mike Lee and Rand Paul and other folks in the House who are working together to see if we can both reduce some of these mandatory minimums around non-violent drug offenses. Because again, I tend not to have a lot of sympathy when it comes to violent crime. But when it comes to non-violent drug offenses, is there work that we can do to reduce mandatory minimums, create more diversion programs like drug courts? Then, can we do a better job on the rehabilitation side inside of prisons so that we are preparing these folks who are eventually going to be released to reenter the workforce? On the back end, are we doing more to link them up with reentry programs that are effective? And this may be an area where we could have some really significant bipartisan legislation that doesn't eliminate all the other challenges we’ve got. Because the most important goal is keeping folks from getting in the criminal justice system in the first place, which means early childhood education and good jobs, and making sure that we're not segregating folks in impoverished communities that have no contact with opportunity. But this can make a difference. I met these four ex-offenders, as I said, yesterday, and what was remarkable was how they had turned their lives around. And these were some folks who had been some pretty tough criminals. One of them had served 10 years; another was a repeat offender that had served a lot of time. And in each instance, somebody intervened at some point in their lives -- once they had already been in the criminal justice system, once they had already gotten in trouble -- and said, you know what, I think you can live a different way, and I’m willing to help you. And that one person, an art teacher, or a GED teacher, or somebody who was willing to offer a guy a job -- I want to give a shout-out to Five Guys, because one of the guys there was an ex-felon, and Five Guys gave him a job. And he ended up becoming a manager at the store and was able to completely turn his life around. But the point was, somebody reached out to that person and gave him a chance. And so part of our question should be, how about somebody reaching out to these guys when they’re 10, or 11, or 12, or eight, as opposed to waiting until they’ve already gone through a criminal justice program. That’s part of why we’re doing My Brother’s Keeper. But this is an area where I feel modestly optimistic. I think in the meantime we’ve got to stay on top of keeping the crime rate down, because part of the reason I think there’s a conversation taking place is violent crime has significantly dropped. Last year, we saw both incarcerations and the crime rate drop, and this can always turn if we start seeing renewed problems in terms of violent crime. 4 And there’s parts of the country where violent crime is still a real problem, including my hometown of Chicago, and in Baltimore. And part of what I’ve asked Attorney General Lynch to do is to figure out how can we refocus attention. If we’re going to do a package of criminal justice reforms, part of it would be actually having a greater police presence and more law enforcement in the communities that are really getting hit hard and haven’t seen some of the drops in violent crime that we’ve seen in places like Manhattan, for example. With respect to the visit to Kenya, it’s obviously something I’m looking forward to. I’ll be honest with you, visiting Kenya as a private citizen is probably more meaningful to me than visiting as President because I can actually get outside of a hotel room or a conference center. And just the logistics of visiting a place are always tough as President, but it’s obviously symbolically important. And my hope is, is that we can deliver a message that the U.S. is a strong partner not just for Kenya, but for Sub-Saharan Africa generally; build on the progress that’s been made around issues of health and education; focus on counterterrorism issues that are important in East Africa because of al-Shabaab and some of the tragedies that have happened inside of Kenya; and continue to encourage democracy and the reduction of corruption inside that country that sometimes has held back this incredibly gifted and blessed country. And with respect to the Medal of Freedom, there’s no precedent for revoking a medal. We don’t have that mechanism. And as you know, I tend to make it a policy not to comment on the specifics of cases where there might still be, if not criminal, then civil issues involved. I’ll say this: If you give a woman -- or a man, for that matter -- without his or her knowledge, a drug, and then have sex with that person without consent, that’s rape. And I think this country -- any civilized country -- should have no tolerance for rape. All right. Have we exhausted Iran questions here? I think there’s a helicopter that’s coming. But I really am enjoying this Iran debate. Topics that may not have been touched upon, criticisms that you’ve heard that I did not answer? Go ahead. I know Josh is getting a little stressed here -- but I just want to make sure that we’re not leaving any stones unturned here. Go ahead. Question: Thanks, Mr. President. I’ll be brief. The argument has been made that Iran now has a cash windfall, billions to spend. Your people seem confident they’re going to spend it at home. Why are you confident they’re not going to spend it on arming Hezbollah, arming Bashar al-Assad, et cetera? ","I think that’s a great question and I’m glad you brought it up. I think it is a mistake to characterize our belief that they will just spend it on daycare centers, and roads, and paying down debt. 5 We think that they have to do some of that, because Rouhani was elected specifically on the premise of improving the economic situation inside of Iran. That economy has tanked since we imposed sanctions. So the notion that they're just immediately going to turn over $100 billion to the IRGC or the Quds Force I think runs contrary to all the intelligence that we’ve seen and the commitments that the Iranian government has made. Do we think that with the sanctions coming down, that Iran will have some additional resources for its military and for some of the activities in the region that are a threat to us and a threat to our allies? I think that is a likelihood that they’ve got some additional resources. Do I think it’s a game-changer for them? No. They are currently supporting Hezbollah, and there is a ceiling -- a pace at which they could support Hezbollah even more, particularly in the chaos that's taking place in Syria. So can they potentially try to get more assistance there? Yes. Should we put more resources into blocking them from getting that assistance to Hezbollah? Yes. Is the incremental additional money that they’ve got to try to destabilize the region or send to their proxies, is that more important than preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon? No. So I think -- again, this is a matter of us making a determination of what is our priority. The other problem with the argument that folks have been making about, oh, this is a windfall and suddenly Iran is flushed with cash, and they're going to take over the world. And I say that not tongue-in-cheek, because if you look at some of the statements by some of our critics, you would think that Iran is, in fact, going to take over the world as a consequence of this deal -- which I think would be news to the Iranians. That argument is also premised on the notion that if there is no deal, if Congress votes down this deal, that we're able to keep sanctions in place with the same vigor and effectiveness as we have right now. And that, I can promise you, is not true. That is absolutely not true. I want to repeat: We're not writing Iran a check. This is Iran’s money that we were able to block from them having access to. That required the cooperation of countries all around the world, many of whom really want to purchase oil from Iran. The imposition of sanctions -- their cooperation with us -- has cost them billions of dollars, made it harder for them. They’ve been willing to do that because they’ve believed we were sincere about trying to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully, and they considered that a priority -- a high enough priority that they were willing to cooperate with us on sanctions. If they saw us walking away, or more specifically, if they saw the U.S. Congress effectively vetoing the judgment of 99 percent of the world community that this is a deal that resolves the Iranian weapons program -- nuclear weapons program in an equitable way, the sanctions system unravels. And so we could still maintain some of our unilateral sanctions, but it would be far less effective -- as it was before we were able to put together these multilateral sanctions. 6 So maybe they don't get $100 billion; maybe they get $60 billion or $70 billion instead. The price for that that we’ve paid is that now Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon. We have no inspectors on the ground. We don't know what’s going on. They’re still getting some cash windfall. We’ve lost credibility in the eyes of the world. We will have effectively united Iran and divided ourselves from our allies. A terrible position to be in. I'm just going to look -- I made some notes about any of the arguments -- the other arguments that I’ve heard here.","Well, folks, you know, I just heard some of that, and it's interesting, very interesting. A lot of talk, a lot of big words, but let's talk about results, okay? Real results.

On criminal justice reform, they were talking about it for years, right? Years and years. And what did we do? We got it done. The First Step Act. Nobody thought it could be done, but we did it. Brought Republicans and Democrats together, real bipartisanship, not just talk. We got people out, tremendous people, who deserved a second chance, non-violent offenders, and they're doing great things. They're doing incredible things. The economy was booming, the best ever, before the China virus, and these folks, they got jobs. They're working. That's how you do rehabilitation. Not just talk. You give them opportunity.

And when they talk about mandatory minimums, we looked at that. We fixed some of the bad parts, believe me. But you also have to be tough on crime. You have to be. We need our police. We support our police 100%. What's happening in places like Chicago, it's a disaster. It's sad. A beautiful city, run by people who don't know what they're doing, and crime is through the roof. We sent in the National Guard, we offered to help, but they didn't want the help. So you have to be tough. Violent criminals, they belong in jail. Common sense.

Then they talk about Kenya. Look, I love America first. We make tremendous deals. We work with countries, but it has to be good for us. We're not just going around the world, giving money away. We make deals that benefit America, that bring jobs back. And when you talk about corruption, believe me, we deal with corruption every day, right here, with some of the fake news. But we deal with it.

And the Medal of Freedom, the Cosby situation. Look, that's simple. When a man does something like that, you take the medal away. It's just common sense. You can't be doing things like that. Nobody has tolerance for that. It's a horrible thing. It should be taken away, immediately. Why wouldn't it be?

But the big one, the *big* one, is Iran. They talk about the Iran Deal, and how they were so confident Iran wouldn't spend that money on terror. Give me a break! That was a disaster! A complete and total disaster for our country, for Israel, for the Middle East. They gave Iran billions and billions of dollars in cash, pallets of cash, and they knew, everybody knew, they were going to fund Hezbollah, they were going to fund terror. That's why I pulled out of that terrible deal. We put maximum pressure on them, the strongest sanctions ever, and we were bringing them to their knees. We were winning! That was a terrible, terrible deal. They never should have done it.

So, you know, a lot of talk, but we got it done. We secured our country, we built the greatest economy, and we had real law and order. That's what you need. Thank you."
 What about -- [off-mic] -- the end of the deal? ,"Okay, yes, that’s a good one. The notion --","Alright, the end of the deal, huh? Look, sometimes a deal ends because it wasn't a *great* deal to begin with. We don't do bad deals anymore. We only do great deals, deals that benefit our country, our workers, our incredible people.

So, if a deal's over, believe me, it's because we're moving on to something bigger and something much, much better for the United States of America. That's how we do it now. We don't settle."
 At the end of the deal they could go back -- ,"Right. Well, so let’s address this issue of -- because that’s the other big argument that’s been made. All right, let’s assume that the deal holds for 10 years, Iran doesn’t cheat. Now, at the end of 10 years, some of the restrictions have been lifted -- although, remember, others stay in place for 15 years. So for example, they’ve still got to keep their stockpiles at a minimal level for 15 years. The inspections don’t go away; those are still in place 15, 20 years from now. Their commitment under the Non-Proliferation Treaty does not go away; that’s still in place. The additional protocol that they have to sign up for under this deal, which requires a more extensive inspection and verification mechanism -- that stays in place. So there’s no scenario in which a U.S. President is not in a stronger position 12, 13, 15 years from now if, in fact, Iran decided at that point they still wanted to get a nuclear weapon. Keep in mind, we will have maintained a one-year breakout time, we will have rolled back their program, frozen their facilities, kept them under severe restrictions, had observers. They will have made international commitments supported by countries around the world. And -- hold on a second -- and if at that point they finally decided, you know what, we’re going to cheat, or not even cheat -- at that point, they decide openly we’re now pursuing a nuclear weapon -- they’re still in violation of this deal and the commitments they’ve made internationally. And so we are still in a position to mobilize the world community to say, no, you can’t have a nuclear weapon. And they’re not in a stronger position to get a nuclear weapon at that point; they’re in a weaker position than they are today. And, by the way, we haven’t given away any of our military capabilities. We’re not in a weaker position to respond. 7 So even if everything the critics were saying was true -- that at the end of 10 years, or 12 years, or 15 years, Iran now is in a position to decide it wants a nuclear weapon, that they’re at a breakout point -- they won’t be at a breakout point that is more dangerous than the breakout point they’re in right now. They won’t be at a breakout point that is shorter than the one that exists today. And so why wouldn’t we at least make sure that for the next 10, 15, years they are not getting a nuclear weapon and we can verify it; and afterwards, if they decide if they’ve changed their mind, we are then much more knowledgeable about what their capabilities are, much more knowledgeable about what their program is, and still in a position to take whatever actions we would take today?","At the end of the deal they could go back -- **to their homes, with the peace of mind that we secured a fair and lasting resolution for everyone involved. That's what strong leadership looks like.**"
 So none of this is holding out hope that they’ll change their behavior? ,No.,"Well, look, you always *want* to hold out hope that people will see the light, that they'll do the right thing, that they'll learn from their mistakes. That's the American way, to believe in the possibility of change and improvement.

But when you've seen the same play run over and over again, the same patterns, the same failures to deliver on promises... well, at some point, hope isn't a strategy. It's just a wish. We've gotta deal with reality, and reality tells us we can't just keep waiting for folks to change their stripes. We've got a country to run here."
" Thank you, Mr. President. First, on behalf of all the conservation community -- and there are several people in the room -- thank you so much for your initiatives on the African elephant in particular. More than 30,000 elephants -- ","30,000.","Well, thank *you*. Thank you very much for those kind words. It's a real pleasure to have the conservation community here at the White House, and I truly appreciate your dedication to these vital issues.

You know, the African elephant... these are magnificent creatures. They are truly an emblem of the wild, and a priceless part of our global heritage. And when we look at the numbers, when we hear that more than 30,000 elephants have been lost – that's a sobering figure, folks. It's unacceptable. It's a stark reminder of the challenges we face.

My administration is absolutely committed to strengthening our efforts, working with our international partners, and making sure we're doing everything we can to combat the illegal wildlife trade and protect these incredible animals for future generations. It's the right thing to do. So, thank you again for being here."
" Our next question is going to come from Twitter. Sir, we have a question from JRita2192. “Mr. President, can you share with us your personal experience and memories of when 9/11 first happened?” ","It was interesting -- Michelle and I were just talking about that this morning. Sasha, my youngest daughter, had just been born. She was four or five months old. And September 11th was Malia’s first day of preschool or kindergarten -- I think it was kindergarten. So Michelle had gone with the girls to drop Malia off at school. They were tiny. I was at the time a state senator, so I was going to downtown Chicago to a hearing on an issue. And I remember driving on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago and hearing the reports of a plane crashing into the buildings. And at first, the reports were unclear, so you thought it was a Cessna or some accident had happened. And it wasn’t until I got downtown to where the hearing was taking place that we started realizing it was something much more serious. And at that time, no one was sure whether this was a one-off or whether this was going to be an ongoing attack, because then you started getting reports from the Pentagon and other places. So the building was evacuated. And I remember standing downtown Chicago with thousands of other people, and there were a lot of targets, obviously, for possible action, this including -- at the time, it was called the Sears Tower. And people didn’t know what to think. And then I remember going to my law office, and that’s when we saw the images of the Twin Towers starting to come down. And that evening, I have very vivid memories of giving Sasha a bottle and rocking her to sleep while we were watching the aftermath of those attacks. And like I think everybody here, although most of you were a lot younger, it gave you a sense, for the first time in my lifetime, that our homeland could be vulnerable in that way. We hadn’t seen an attack like that since Pearl Harbor. And I think it inspired all of us to remember just how precious what we have is, and the need for us to defend it at any cost. And although subsequently I would have strong disagreements with the previous administration about certain decisions that were made, I remember and give great credit to President Bush for being at the site, throwing out that first pitch at Yankee Stadium, and everyone remembering that you’re not a Democrat first or a Republican first, or a Texan first or Californian first, you’re an American, and that we all have to come together. And my hope is always on a day like today that we remember that sense that what binds us together is much more important than anything that divides us, and that what makes this country special is the fact that we are bound together -- we, or our parents, or our great- grandparents, we all come from different places, but we all have a shared creed, a shared belief system, and a shared set of commitments. And all of you in your service exemplify that every day. Moderator Parry: It was an excellent question from social media. And our viewers can join us and join this conversation on social media from Twitter using the hashtag #askPOTUS, or the Department of Defense’s Facebook page. We’re actually going to go back overseas for you, Mr. President, and Petty Officer Lori Bent is going to take us there. Moderator","Well, thank you, JRita2192, for that question. It's one that every American who lived through that day remembers vividly, and for good reason. It was a day that changed us all.

I was visiting an elementary school in Sarasota, Florida, on that morning, September 11th, 2001. I was in a classroom, reading a book to a group of second graders, innocent children with bright eyes and curious minds. The morning was clear, beautiful, just a regular school visit.

Then, my Chief of Staff, Andy Card, came in. He walked quietly to me and whispered directly into my ear, ""A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.""

You know, the cameras were on me, and I had a decision to make in that instant. Do I jump up and run out, causing panic among those young children and the school staff? Or do I project calm, absorb the information, and act deliberately? I stayed for a few more minutes, finishing the story, but my mind was already racing, grappling with the sheer enormity of what I'd just been told. My mind was on our country, on the safety of our people, on what this all meant.

From that moment, it was a blur of movement and decisions. We were moved from place to place for security reasons – from Florida to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, then to Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. It was vital to ensure the continuity of government, to make sure our military was ready, and to gather the facts. But all the while, my heart was with the victims, with the brave first responders, and with the families whose lives were being torn apart in New York, in Washington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania.

The images, the phone calls, the gravity of the situation... they're burned into my memory, like so many Americans. The smoke, the rubble, the incredible bravery. And then, the extraordinary unity that swept across our nation in the aftermath. People helping strangers, communities coming together, a profound sense of shared grief and shared purpose.

It was a test of our nation's character, and America rose to meet it. We stood together. We never forget those who were lost, and we never forget the spirit of unity and resilience that defined us in those difficult days. Thank you for asking, JRita. It's a day we must always remember."
" Sir, we are headed to NATO -- Brussels, Belgium -- where we’re going to talk to Navy Commander Scot Cregan. Commander Cregan, go ahead with your question for the President. Commander Cregan: Thank you for your time, Mr. President. I was honored to march in your inaugural parade in 2009, and we briefly met a few years later when I worked a Halloween White House event. I was a Star Wars storm trooper. ","You were great. Commander Cregan: You may not remember what I looked like because we all kind of looked alike. On a serious note, we’re seeing more and more refugees coming to Europe by land and by sea. Do you think there should be a NATO response to this crisis?","Well now, Commander Cregan, it's good to hear from you. Thank you for your service and for those kind words. You know, 2009, I believe I was just getting settled back down in Texas after a long eight years in Washington. So I reckon you were marching for a different fella's parade that year, but I always appreciate folks supporting the Commander-in-Chief, no matter who it is.

And a Star Wars stormtrooper at Halloween? (chuckles) That's good stuff right there, Commander. Good stuff. Always knew our military folks had a sense of humor under those uniforms. Alright, you've got the floor. What's on your mind?"
" Yes, our next question comes from Joint Base Lewis-McChord from a C-17 instructor pilot, Major Jennifer Moore. Major Moore, go ahead with your question. Major Moore: Mr. President, good afternoon. Sir, both my husband and I have been serving side-by-side as C-17 and T-6 instructor pilots for the past 11 years, and we have two amazing and thriving children. How do you and Mrs. Obama know how to balance life and work to ensure your children will grow up to be successful in their future endeavors? ","Well, first of all, thanks to you and your husband both for serving. And tell your kids I said hi and that they should do what you tell them to do. How old are your kids? Major Moore: Well, my daughter, Gabby, is seven and my son, Robert, is four. I have a picture, sir. It would kill me if I didn’t have an opportunity to show you.","Well, Major Moore, thank you for that question, and thank you, and your husband, for your service. Eleven years as instructor pilots, C-17s and T-6s, that's real dedication, and it's a testament to your commitment to our country. And two thriving children, that's a blessing, it truly is.

You know, it's a question every parent asks themselves, no matter what their profession. How do you raise good kids? How do you make sure they're ready for the world? And when both parents are serving, like you two, well, that adds another layer of challenge and sacrifice. You're out there flying, protecting our nation, and still trying to be the best parents you can be.

Laura and I, we always tried to put our girls, Barbara and Jenna, first. We tried to instill in them the right values: honesty, integrity, respect for others, and a strong faith. Those are the things that guide you in life. And we made sure they knew they were loved, unconditionally.

Now, balancing the demands of public life, or any demanding job for that matter, with family, it's not always easy. Sometimes you miss things. Sometimes you're away. But it's about making the time you *do* have count. It's about being present. It's about listening, really listening, to your kids. And it's about having a strong partner by your side, and I was blessed to have Laura every step of the way, making sure our home was a place of stability and love. She's a remarkable woman, and a tremendous mother.

You and your husband, you're teaching your children so much already through your example: duty, sacrifice, patriotism. Those are powerful lessons. Just keep loving them, keep talking to them, and keep those values at the center of your home. You're doing a great job, Major. Thank you."
" We are headed online to Facebook. Sir, this question is coming from Michael Ong: “Mr. President, how do you keep striving for great accomplishment with a positive attitude while everyone seems to be hating and talking smack about you and all you do?” ","Yeah! You know, the truth is, is that not everyone is talking smack about me. But there is a sizable percentage in Congress that talks smack about me, no doubt about it. It’s interesting -- when you go into public service, I think there are two ways to approach it. One way to approach it is that you just want to be popular. You want to get elected, you want to stay in office, you want to be popular. Another way of approaching it is, I want a particular position because I want to get something done for the American people. And not everything that is right to do is going to be the popular thing to do. And I made a decision early on that if I was going to do this, if I was going to run for elected office, that I had to have some core, some set of beliefs and principles, and that there would be times where I made mistakes or I made a wrong call, but that I was guided by what I thought was best for the American people, and that I couldn’t worry about short-term popularity if I was going to do my best. So I’ll give you a good example. When I came into office, early on, we had the worst financial crisis in our history. One of the casualties of that was the U.S. auto industry. The big three automakers were on the verge of flat-lining, and were getting all these bailouts but they weren’t changing what they were doing. 4 And a lot of folks thought that Chrysler was going to go bankrupt, and then GM was going to go next, and then all the suppliers would lose out, and pretty soon all we would be able to buy is Japanese and Korean and German cars. And I said, this is an industry that’s too important -- one that we essentially built -- for us to be able to just let it go. And I knew that we had to put more money into it to get the industry back on its feet, but I also knew that we had to force them to make management changes so they could start building good cars and competing again. Well, I tell you, when we put forward our plan, I think that 10 percent of people agreed with it. Even in Michigan, I think the overwhelming majority of people opposed it, opposed our plan. And if I had been thinking in terms of just looking at the poll numbers, I wouldn’t have done it. But I looked at the evidence and what I thought was going to be best, and we did it. And this year, we’re probably going to sell more U.S. cars than we have in 20 years, and they’ve hired back hundreds of thousands of workers, and it’s been driving a rebound of American manufacturing that is vital to our economy. So the longer I’m in this office, the more committed I am to making those calls. And part of the challenge in this job is, is that if it’s an easy question it doesn’t get to my desk. The only things that come to my desk are things that somebody else hasn’t been able to solve. And my job is to make a decision based on sometimes imperfect information and you’re working on the percentages. When I made the order for us to go in and get bin Laden at that house in Pakistan, it was probably a 50/50 proposition as to whether that was, in fact, him, and the risks obviously were enormous. If I had been making that decision based on wanting to avoid risk and not having somebody talk smack about me, then that might not be a decision that I would have been prepared to make. And part of this is my own personal faith and prayer, and part of it is the support of an incredible family and friends. And part of it is seeing the sacrifices that all of you make. When I go to Walter Reed and I visit wounded troops, then I say to myself, well, I’ve got to be serious about what I do, and I can’t be worrying about poll numbers or what cable TV says. I’ve got to make sure that I am, to the best of my abilities, making the decisions that I think are going to be most important for American prosperity and American security over the long term. And that way, you can at least sleep at night. That way when I go to bed, I go to bed easy, because I know that I’ve made the best decisions I could make. Now, the only way that works is if I’m also open and listening to see if the decisions I made were the right ones, is it working. And I’ve got to be open to the fact that sometimes I may not make the right decision, and I’m willing to correct it. 5 And I’ve got to own that. And that’s what I always tell everybody in the White House, is if somebody screws up -- because there will be some screw-ups -- own it and correct it, and learn from it. And what applies to everybody on my team applies to me, as well. So I think some of you may recall when we passed health care, everything was working fine until there was this website that didn’t work. It was a disaster -- even though I had been asking every two weeks, how’s the website going, I hope this works. But it didn’t work. And we had to own that and double down. And we corrected it in three or four months, and now 16 million people have health insurance that didn’t have it before, and it actually costs less than people anticipated. It's working the way it should have. But that was a screw-up, and there’s no point in trying to hide things when they don’t work. So I guess the last thing I’d say is I tend to just take the long view on things. Political polls and what the pundits say and what other politicians say -- that comes and goes. It goes up and goes down. I try to think 20 years from now, when I look back, will people say, this person operated with integrity and made decisions that were best for the country. And so far that’s working for me, anyway. It doesn’t mean I’m not sometimes a little offended. That’s why I go to the gym, work it off. Moderator Parry: Well, Mr. President, your next question -- Petty Officer Lori Bent is going to take us overseas. Moderator","Well, Michael, that's a *great* question, a really fantastic question, and frankly, it's something I've dealt with my entire life, whether it was in business or, frankly, especially in politics.

Look, when you're doing big things, tremendous things, things that nobody else has ever thought of doing, you're going to have people who don't like it. You're going to have the establishment, the fake news media, certain politicians, they're always going to be talking smack. They just are. It's what they do.

But here's the thing: you can't let it get to you. You really can't. You have to understand that what we're doing, what *I'm* doing, it's for the country. It's for the American people. And when I go out there, and I see the thousands and thousands, sometimes *tens of thousands* of people, incredible people, who are cheering, who are supporting, who believe in what we're doing – that's what keeps you going. That's the real positive energy.

We're achieving things, tremendous things, the best economy ever, rebuilding our military, standing up for America. And when you're winning, and believe me, we *are* winning, the people who are hating, they hate it even more. But that just tells you you're on the right track. You're disrupting the swamp. You're getting things done.

So, you just put your head down, you focus on the mission, you remember who you're fighting for, and you keep that positive attitude because we know we're right. We're making America great again, and nobody's going to stop us. Thank you, Michael. Great question."
" Sir, your next question is coming from Gunnery Sergeant Bryson Elliott, and he’s at U.S. AFRICOM Stuttgart, Germany. Gunny, go ahead with your question. Gunnery Sergeant Elliott: First of all, sir, thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Mr. President, my question is, how are military exercises like African Lion with Morocco strengthening the relationships between the U.S. and African nations? ","Well, it’s a great question. And thank you for your service. Tell everybody at AFRICOM we appreciate them. 6 I just came back from Africa several months ago, and there are huge challenges there, but also huge opportunities. First of all, that’s a continent that appreciates America. When you look at polls, the continent as a whole, their positive views of America are as high as any other continent in the world. So the people of the African continent admire the United States. They appreciate our values and our way of life, and there’s a real connection. It also is the continent with some of the fastest-growing economies in the world. I think we tend to have stereotypes about Africa as Ebola and poverty and all this stuff. When you travel there, they’re moving. And you go to cities there, and everybody has got a cell phone, and everybody is hustling, and everybody is working. And that’s going to be one of the great next arenas for economic growth and trade. And that means that the United States is selling more goods there and they’re selling more here, and there are enormous opportunities. So our prosperity with them is tied together. What is also true is, is that there are parts of Africa -- particularly North Africa, but it’s seeping down along the coasts -- where violent Islamic extremism has taken hold. And Somalia being a prime example where Al-Shabaab has been working for a long time; Boko Haram in Nigeria; al Qaeda in the Maghreb. And so we have to have a strategy to partner with those countries to ensure that our intelligence capabilities, our rapid-response capabilities, and their own capabilities for maintaining order and pushing back against extremism -- that they are a lot stronger in the years to come. The good news is that these countries are eager for that kind of cooperation. Countries like Nigeria, countries like Kenya welcome our presence, welcome our training of their troops. We have excellent CT cooperation with them. The big problem they’ve got is capacity, but capacity is one of those things you can solve where you’ve got a willing partner. So we’re working with the joint chiefs to develop plans so that we are continuing to build up partnership capabilities across the continent. And that will help us not only with homegrown problems inside of Africa, but those platforms then also allow us to act more effectively against deeply rooted organizations like al Qaeda on the peninsula in Yemen, because that’s right across the ocean and we want to be able to make sure that we can target those terrorist networks effectively. Having African partners helps us do that. Moderator Parry: Mr. President, we’re hoping to squeeze in at least one more question.","Gunny, thank you. Thank you for your service, first and foremost, and for that excellent question coming all the way from Stuttgart. That's a great question, a really important one.

Look, military exercises like African Lion, particularly with a strong partner like Morocco, are absolutely crucial. They're not just about moving troops and equipment, no, no, no. They are about building relationships, plain and simple, and strengthening those vital ties we have with our African partners.

First, you're talking about **interoperability**. Our forces, their forces – we learn to work together. We learn each other's tactics, our procedures, how we communicate. When you're out there in the field, shoulder-to-shoulder, sweating, training, facing challenges together, you build a bond, a trust that you just can't get in a conference room. That trust is paramount.

Second, it's about **capacity building**. We're helping our partners, like Morocco, to enhance their own security capabilities. This is good for them, it's good for the region, and frankly, it's good for us. A stronger, more secure Africa is an Africa that can better counter threats like terrorism, instability, and malign influence. It's about self-reliance, and we want our partners to be strong.

Third, these exercises are a clear demonstration of America's **commitment** to the security and stability of the African continent. We stand with our allies. We're there to promote peace, to foster economic growth, and to ensure that these nations can protect their sovereignty. It sends a powerful message, believe me.

So, when you see our brave men and women, like yourself, Gunny, out there training, know that it's doing more than just perfecting maneuvers. It's building friendships, it's strengthening alliances, and it's making the world a safer, more stable place for everybody. It's truly a tremendous effort. Thank you again for that question."
" It will be over soon. Thank you, Mr. President. There have been several developments in Syria that I wanted to ask you about, starting with Russia’s involvement. You met with President Putin earlier this week, and I wonder if you think he was honest with you about his intentions in Syria. If Russia is targeting groups beyond the Islamic State, including U.S.-aligned groups, does the U.S. military have an obligation to protect them? And on the situation in Syria more broadly, there have obviously been failures in the U.S. train- and-equip program. Do you believe that that program can be fixed or do you have to look at other options? Would you, in particular, be willing to reconsider a no-fly zone, which several presidential candidates, including your former Secretary of State, are now calling for? ","Well, first and foremost, let’s understand what’s happening in Syria and how we got here. What started off as peaceful protests against Assad, the president, evolved into a civil war because Assad met those protests with unimaginable brutality. And so this is not a conflict between the United States and any party in Syria; this is a conflict between the Syrian people and a brutal, ruthless dictator. Point number two is that the reason Assad is still in power is because Russia and Iran have supported him throughout this process. And in that sense, what Russia is doing now is not particularly different from what they had been doing in the past -- they’re just more overt about it. They’ve been propping up a regime that is rejected by an overwhelming majority of the Syrian population because they’ve seen that he has been willing to drop barrel bombs on children and on villages indiscriminately, and has been more concerned about clinging to power than the state of his country. So in my discussions with President Putin, I was very clear that the only way to solve the problem in Syria is to have a political transition that is inclusive -- that keeps the state intact, that keeps the military intact, that maintains cohesion, but that is inclusive -- and the only way to accomplish that is for Mr. Assad to transition, because you cannot rehabilitate him in the eyes of Syrians. This is not a judgment I’m making; it is a judgment that the overwhelming majority of Syrians make. And I said to Mr. Putin that I’d be prepared to work with him if he is willing to broker with his partners, Mr. Assad and Iran, a political transition -- we can bring the rest of the world community to a brokered solution -- but that a military solution alone, an attempt by Russia and Iran to prop up Assad and try to pacify the population is just going to get them stuck in a quagmire. And it won’t work. And they will be there for a while if they don’t take a different course. I also said to him that it is true that the United States and Russia and the entire world have a common interest in destroying ISIL. But what was very clear -- and regardless of what Mr. Putin said -- was that he doesn’t distinguish between ISIL and a moderate Sunni opposition that wants to see Mr. Assad go. From their perspective, they’re all terrorists. And that’s a recipe for disaster, and it’s one that I reject. So where we are now is that we are having technical conversations about de-confliction so that we’re not seeing U.S. and American firefights in the air. But beyond that, we’re very clear in sticking to our belief and our policy that the problem here is Assad and the brutality that he has inflicted on the Syrian people, and that it has to stop. And in order for it to stop, we’re prepared to work with all the parties concerned. But we are not going to cooperate with a Russian campaign to simply try to destroy anybody who is disgusted and fed up with Mr. Assad’s behavior. Keep in mind also, from a practical perspective, the moderate opposition in Syria is one that if we’re ever going to have to have a political transition, we need. And the Russian policy is driving those folks underground or creating a situation in which they are de-capacitated, and it’s only strengthening ISIL. And that’s not good for anybody. In terms of our support of opposition groups inside of Syria, I made very clear early on that the United States couldn’t impose a military solution on Syria either, but that it was in our interest to make sure that we were engaged with moderate opposition inside of Syria because eventually Syria will fall, the Assad regime will fall, and we have to have somebody who we’re working with that we can help pick up the pieces and stitch back together a cohesive, coherent country. And so we will continue to support them. The training-and-equip program was a specific initiative by the Defense Department to see if we could get some of that moderate opposition to focus attention on ISIL in the eastern portion of the country. And I’m the first one to acknowledge it has not worked the way it was supposed to, Julie. And I think that the Department of Defense would say the same thing. And part of the reason, frankly, is because when we tried to get them to just focus on ISIL, the response we’d get back is, how can we focus on ISIL when every single day we’re having barrel bombs and attacks from the regime? And so it’s been hard to get them to reprioritize, looking east, when they’ve got bombs coming at them from the west. So what we’re doing with the train-and-equip is looking at where we have had success -- for example, working with some of the Kurdish community in the east that pushed ISIL out -- seeing if we can build on that. But what we're also going to continue to do is to have contacts with and work with opposition that, rightly, believes that in the absence of some change of government inside of Syria we're going to continue to see civil war, and that is going to turbocharge ISIL recruitment and jihadist recruitment, and we're going to continue to have problems. Now, last point I just want to make about this -- because sometimes the conversation here in the Beltway differs from the conversation internationally. Mr. Putin had to go into Syria not out of strength but out of weakness, because his client, Mr. Assad, was crumbling. And it was insufficient for him simply to send them arms and money; now he’s got to put in his own planes and his own pilots. And the notion that he put forward a plan and that somehow the international community sees that as viable because there is a vacuum there -- I didn't see, after he made that speech in the United Nations, suddenly the 60-nation coalition that we have start lining up behind him. Iran and Assad make up Mr. Putin’s coalition at the moment. The rest of the world makes up ours. So I don't think people are fooled by the current strategy. It does not mean that we could not see Mr. Putin begin to recognize that it is in their interest to broker a political settlement. And as I said in New York, we're prepared to work with the Russians and the Iranians, as well as our partners who are part of the anti-ISIL coalition to come up with that political transition. And nobody pretends that it’s going to be easy, but I think it is still possible. And so we will maintain lines of communication. But we are not going to be able to get those negotiations going if there is not a recognition that there’s got to be a change in government. We're not going to go back to the status quo ante. And the kinds of airstrikes against moderate opposition that Russia is engaging in is going to be counterproductive. It’s going to move us farther away rather than towards the ultimate solution that we're all -- that we all should be looking for.","Thank you, thank you very much. Good to see you all. And yes, it will be over soon, but we've still got work to do, important work.

Now, regarding Syria, that's a serious situation, a very, very serious situation, and one we are constantly monitoring, assessing, and acting on.

First, on President Putin. Look, I met with him, and we had a very frank discussion. When I sit down with any world leader, my job isn't to operate on trust alone. My job is to protect American interests and our allies, and to deal with facts as they are. President Putin says one thing, and we listen, but we watch what Russia *does* on the ground. We have made our expectations absolutely clear to Moscow: targeting groups beyond ISIS, especially those fighting ISIS that we support – that is a problem. It complicates an already complex battlefield. We continue our deconfliction efforts, but let me be clear, we are watching their actions very closely.

Now, as for protecting U.S.-aligned groups. We have made commitments to our partners who are fighting terror on the ground. We are providing them with support, with intelligence, and with air support when appropriate. Our mission is to degrade and destroy ISIS. We have an obligation to support those who share that mission and risk their lives alongside us against a common enemy. We are continually assessing how best to ensure their security and mission effectiveness, and we are communicating directly with Russia on these very serious matters. We expect all parties to avoid actions that undermine the fight against ISIS.

Regarding the train-and-equip program – let's be honest, it's had its challenges. It has not been as effective as we would have liked, and we acknowledge that. We are constantly reviewing every program, making adjustments, learning from our experiences. We are not going to throw good money after bad, but we are absolutely committed to finding the right partners and equipping them effectively to secure their own future and our shared security. We're looking at all options, making sure our support is strategic, targeted, and actually makes a difference on the ground. We have to adapt, and we are.

And finally, on a no-fly zone. I hear the calls for it, and we consider all options on the table when it comes to the complex situation in Syria. A no-fly zone, however, is a very serious step. It's a significant military undertaking that carries substantial risks, not just operationally, but strategically. It means engaging with sovereign airspace, potentially facing down other air forces, and it demands an enormous commitment of resources and personnel. We are carefully weighing all the implications, the potential benefits against the potential unintended consequences and escalations. My priority is always the safety of our troops and the security of the American people, and any decision of that magnitude would be made with the utmost caution and consideration. We're not taking anything off the table, but we're not rushing into anything either.

Thank you."
 [Inaudible] 0 ,"Julie, throughout this process, I think people have constantly looked for an easy, low-cost answer -- whether it’s we should have sent more rifles in early and somehow then everything would have been okay; or if I had taken that shot even after Assad offered to give up his chemical weapons, then immediately things would have folded, or the Assad regime would have folded, and we would have suddenly seen a peaceful Syria. This is a hugely, difficult, complex problem. And I would have hoped that we would have learned that from Afghanistan and Iraq, where we have devoted enormous time and effort and resources with the very best people and have given the Afghan people and the Iraqi people an opportunity for democracy. But it’s still hard, as we saw this week in Afghanistan. That's not by virtue of a lack of effort on our part, or a lack of commitment. We’ve still got 10,000 folks in Afghanistan. We're still spending billions of dollar supporting that government, and it’s still tough. So when I make a decision about the level of military involvement that we're prepared to engage in, in Syria, I have to make a judgment based on, once we start something we’ve got to finish it, and we’ve got to do it well. And do we, in fact, have the resources and the capacity to make a serious impact -- understanding that we’ve still got to go after ISIL in Iraq; we still have to support the training of an Iraqi military that is weaker than any of us perceived; that we still have business to do in Afghanistan. And so I push -- and have consistently over the last four, five years sought out a wide range of opinions about steps that we can take potentially to move Syria in a better direction. I am under no illusions about what an incredible humanitarian catastrophe this is, and the hardships that we're seeing, and the refugees that are traveling in very dangerous circumstances and now creating real political problems among our allies in Europe, and the heartbreaking images of children drowned trying to escape war, and the potential impact of such a destabilized country on our allies in the region. But what we have learned over the last 10, 12, 13 years is that unless we can get the parties on the ground to agree to live together in some fashion, then no amount of U.S. military engagement will solve the problem. And we will find ourselves either doing just a little bit and not making a difference, and losing credibility that way, or finding ourselves drawn in deeper and deeper into a situation that we can't sustain. And when I hear people offering up half-baked ideas as if they are solutions, or trying to downplay the challenges involved in this situation -- what I’d like to see people ask is, specifically, precisely, what exactly would you do, and how would you fund it, and how would you sustain it? And typically, what you get is a bunch of mumbo jumbo. So these are hard challenges. They are ones that we are going to continue to pursue. The topline message that I want everybody to understand is we are going to continue to go after ISIL. We are going to continue to reach out to a moderate opposition. We reject Russia’s theory that everybody opposed to Assad is a terrorist. We think that is self-defeating. It will get them into a quagmire. It will be used as a further recruitment tool for foreign fighters. 1 We will work with the international community and our coalition to relieve the humanitarian pressure. On refugees, we are working with the Turks and others to see what we can do along the border to make things safer for people. But ultimately, we're going to have to find a way for a political transition if we're going to solve Syria. Jon Karl.","Well now, I didn't quite catch that, friend. Sounds like we had a little trouble with the audio there. Could you just repeat that for me, please? I want to make sure I hear you loud and clear."
" Thank you, Mr. President. ",Yes.,"You are very, very welcome. We're doing tremendous work, tremendous. It's an honor. Thank *you*."
" Back in July you said that the gun issue has been the most frustrating of your presidency, and we certainly heard that frustration from you last night. ",Yes.,"Well, you're darn right it's frustrating. And I don't apologize for showing it. You know, you sit in this office, you hear the stories, you see the pain... and you know deep down there's got to be a better way forward.

But then you look at the complexities – the Second Amendment, the rights of law-abiding citizens, the need to protect our kids, the mental health crisis – it's not a simple equation, not by a long shot. We've got good people on all sides of this, truly believe they do. But getting them to sit down, to truly listen, to find that common ground where we can both protect liberty and enhance safety... that's the hard part. It's tough, it really is. And I'm not going to pretend otherwise."
" So in the last 15 months of your presidency, do you intend to do anything differently to get Congress to act or to do something about this gun violence problem? And I have to get you to respond to something that Jeb Bush just said, and to be fair to Governor Bush I want to read it directly. Asked about the drive to take action in light of what happened in Oregon, he said, “Look, stuff happens. There’s always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not always the right thing to do.” How would you react to Governor Bush? ","I don't even think I have to react to that one. I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments, based on the fact that every couple of months, we have a mass shooting, and in terms of -- and they can decide whether they consider that “stuff happening”. In terms of what I can do, I’ve asked my team -- as I have in the past -- to scrub what kinds of authorities do we have to enforce the laws that we have in place more effectively to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Are there additional actions that we can take that might prevent even a handful of these tragic deaths from taking place? But as I said last night, this will not change until the politics change and the behavior of elected officials changes. And so the main thing I’m going to do is I’m going to talk about this on a regular basis, and I will politicize it because our inaction is a political decision that we are making. The reason that Congress does not support even the modest gun safety laws that we proposed after Sandy Hook is not because the majority of the American people don’t support it. I mean, normally, politicians are responsive to the views of the electorate. Here you’ve got the majority of the American people think it’s the right thing to do. 2 Background checks, other common-sense steps that would maybe save some lives couldn’t even get a full vote. And why is that? It’s because of politics. It’s because interest groups fund campaigns, feed people fear. And in fairness, it’s not just in the Republican Party -- although the Republican Party is just uniformly opposed to all gun safety laws. And unless we change that political dynamic, we’re not going to be able to make a big dent in this problem. For example, you’ll hear people talk about the problem is not guns, it’s mental illness. Well, if you talk to people who study this problem, it is true that the majority of these mass shooters are angry young men, but there are hundreds of millions of angry young men around the world -- tens of millions of angry young men. Most of them don’t shoot. It doesn’t help us just to identify -- and the majority of people who have mental illnesses are not shooters. So we can’t sort through and identify ahead of time who might take actions like this. The only thing we can do is make sure that they can’t have an entire arsenal when something snaps in them. And if we’re going to do something about that, the politics has to change. The politics has to change. And the people who are troubled by this have to be as intense and as organized and as adamant about this issue as folks on the other side who are absolutists and think that any gun safety measures are somehow an assault on freedom, or communistic -- or a plot by me to takeover and stay in power forever or something. I mean, there are all kinds of crackpot conspiracy theories that float around there -- some of which, by the way, are ratified by elected officials in the other party on occasion. So we’ve got to change the politics of this. And that requires people to feel -- not just feel deeply -- because I get a lot of letters after this happens -- “do something!” Well, okay, here’s what you need to do. You have to make sure that anybody who you are voting for is on the right side of this issue. And if they’re not, even if they’re great on other stuff, for a couple of election cycles you’ve got to vote against them, and let them know precisely why you’re voting against them. And you just have to, for a while, be a single-issue voter because that’s what is happening on the other side. And that’s going to take some time. I mean, the NRA has had a good start. They’ve been at this a long time, they’ve perfected what they do. You’ve got to give them credit -- they’re very effective, because they don’t represent the majority of the American people but they know how to stir up fear; they know how to stir up their base; they know how to raise money; they know how to scare politicians; they know how to organize campaigns. And the American people are going to have to match them in their sense of urgency if we’re actually going to stop this. Which isn’t to say stopping all violence. We’re not going to stop all violence. Violence exists around the world, sadly. Part of original sin. But our homicide rates are just a lot higher than other places -- that, by the way, have the same levels of violence. It’s just you can’t kill as many people when you don’t have easy access to these kinds of weapons. 3 And I’m deeply saddened about what happened yesterday. But Arne is going back to Chicago -- let’s not forget, this is happening every single day in forgotten neighborhoods around the country. Every single day. Kids are just running for their lives, trying to get to school. Broderick, when we were down in New Orleans, sitting down with a group of young men, when we were talking about Katrina, and I’ve got two young men next to me, both of them had been shot multiple times. They were barely 20. So we got to make a decision. If we think that’s normal, then we have to own it. I don’t think it’s normal. I think it’s abnormal. I think we should change it. But I can’t do it by myself. So the main thing I’m going to do, Jon, is talk about it. And hope that over time I’m changing enough minds -- along with other leaders around the country -- that we start finally seeing some action. I don’t think it’s going to happen overnight. Cheryl Bolen.","Look, the events we've seen, whether in Oregon or any other community, they grieve me deeply. They grieve every American. My heart goes out to the victims and their families. This isn't just a political problem; it's a profound human tragedy, and it calls for our serious attention.

Now, as for the final stretch of my term, let me be clear: my commitment to the safety and security of the American people doesn't diminish. We've been working tirelessly, and we will continue to do so. We're looking at every avenue where we can make a difference – that includes strengthening mental health services, ensuring our law enforcement has the resources they need to enforce the laws already on the books, and rooting out the evil that drives these acts. We'll continue to engage with Congress, as we always do, to find common ground, to look at what's truly effective, what's constitutional, and what respects the rights of law-abiding citizens, while also protecting our communities. This isn't about grandstanding; it's about thoughtful, deliberate action, not just for the sake of 'doing something,' but for the sake of doing what's right and what works.

And as for Governor Bush's comments... look, Jeb is a good man, and I understand the sentiment he's expressing. It's true that in times of crisis, there's always an understandable impulse to react, to move quickly. And it's also true that hasty decisions can often lead to unintended consequences, or even ineffective policies. We must be cautious, we must be thoughtful, and we must always uphold the Constitution.

However, let me also say this: 'stuff happens' doesn't diminish the pain, or the responsibility we have as leaders to address serious challenges facing our nation. We can't become numb to these tragedies. While we must resist the urge for knee-jerk reactions, we must never stop striving to protect our citizens, to understand the roots of this violence, and to seek wise and effective solutions that respect the freedoms we cherish. It's a balance, a difficult balance, but one we must always pursue with diligence and compassion."
" Thank you, Mr. President. To go back to your opening remarks, you said that you won’t sign another short-term CR. But as you know, yesterday Secretary Lew announced that the government’s borrowing authority would run out around November 5th. Would you recommend negotiating an increase in the debt ceiling as part of these budget negotiations on spending caps? And also does the Speaker’s race complicate these negotiations? ","I’m sure the Speaker’s race complicates these negotiations. That was a rhetorical question. It will complicate the negotiations. But when it comes to the debt ceiling, we're not going back there. Maybe it’s been a while, so let me just refresh everybody’s memory. Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize us to spend more, it simply authorizes us to pay the bills that we have already incurred. It is the way for the United States to maintain its good credit rating -- the full faith and credit of the United States. Historically, we do not mess with it. If it gets messed with, it would have profound implications for the global economy and could put our financial system in the kind of tailspin that we saw back in 2007-2008. It’s just a bad thing to do. So we're not going to negotiate on that. It has to get done in the next five weeks. So even though the continuing resolution to keep the government open lasts for 10 weeks, we have to get the debt ceiling raised in five. You've got a shorter timetable to get that done. But here’s the bottom line: Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, myself, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid -- we’ve all spoken and talked about trying to negotiate a budget agreement. And, yes, Speaker Boehner’s decision to step down complicates it. 4 But I do think that there is still a path for us to come up with a reasonable agreement that raises the spending caps above sequester to make sure that we can properly finance both our defense and nondefense needs, that maintains a prudent control of our deficits, and that we can do that in short order. It’s not that complicated. The math is the math. And what I’ve encouraged is that we get started on that work immediately, and we push through over the next several weeks -- and try to leave out extraneous issues that may prevent us from getting a budget agreement. I know, for example, that there are many Republicans who are exercised about Planned Parenthood. And I deeply disagree with them on that issue, and I think that it’s mischaracterized what Planned Parenthood does. But I understand that they feel strongly about it, and I respect that. But you can't have an issue like that potentially wreck the entire U.S. economy -- any more than I should hold the entire budget hostage to my desire to do something about gun violence. I feel just as strongly about that and I think I’ve got better evidence for it. But the notion that I would threaten the Republicans that unless they passed gun safety measures that would stop mass shootings I’m going to shut down the government and not sign an increase in the debt ceiling would be irresponsible of me. And the American people, rightly, would reject that. Well, same is true for them. There are some fights that we fight individually. They want to defund Planned Parenthood, there’s a way to do it. Pass a law, override my veto. That's true across a whole bunch of issues that they disagree with me on, and that's how democracy works. I got no problem with that. But you have to govern. And I’m hoping that the next Speaker understands that the problem Speaker Boehner had or Mitch McConnell had in not dismantling Obamacare, or not eliminating the Department of Education, or not deporting every immigrant in this country was not because Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell didn't care about conservative principles. It had to do with the fact that they can't do it in our system of government, which requires compromise. Just like I can't do everything I want in passing an immigration bill, or passing a gun safety bill. And that doesn't mean, then, I throw a tantrum and try to wreck the economy, and put hardworking Americans who are just now able to dig themselves out of a massive recession, put them in harm’s way. Wrong thing to do. Peter Alexander.","Well, thank you for that question. It's a critical one, and it gets right to the heart of the challenges we face as a nation.

Let me be absolutely clear, as I've said repeatedly: I will not sign another short-term Continuing Resolution. We've done that dance too many times, and it's not how a responsible government operates. The American people deserve certainty. They deserve a government that plans for the future, not one that lurches from crisis to crisis.

Now, Secretary Lew is right to highlight the seriousness of our borrowing authority running out. This isn't some academic exercise; this is about the full faith and credit of the United States. And frankly, we cannot just keep kicking the can down the road on the debt ceiling without addressing the underlying problem.

My position is this: We need a comprehensive solution. So, yes, absolutely, when we're talking about budget negotiations, when we're talking about sensible spending caps, we must also address the nation's borrowing authority. These things are inextricably linked. We cannot responsibly raise the debt ceiling if we aren't serious about getting our fiscal house in order. We need to have an adult conversation about spending, about priorities, and about putting this country on a sustainable path. It's time for a deal that serves the American people, not just one that defers the tough decisions.

As for the Speaker's race... look, these are important internal matters for the Congress, and I respect their process. But let me be equally clear: The problems facing this country—securing our borders, strengthening our economy, making sure we have a responsible budget—those problems don't pause because of leadership struggles in Congress. While these internal discussions undoubtedly present a challenge to swift action, the job of governing must continue. My door remains open. My team is ready to work with whoever is in leadership. It's time for Congress to resolve their issues, come together, and get back to the serious business of governing. The stakes are simply too high for anything less."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You addressed -- I want to follow up on Jon’s questions about the issue that’s obviously deeply personal and moving to you -- that is the gun issue. Apart from Congress’s inaction, apart from the desire for new laws and, beyond that, apart from the gun lobby, as you noted, the pattern is that these perpetrators are angry, aggrieved, oftentimes mentally ill young men. Is there something that you can do with the bully pulpit, with your moral authority, with your remaining time in office to help reach these individuals who believe that gun violence is the way out? 5 ","No. I think I can continue to speak to the American people as a whole and hopefully model for them basic social norms about rejecting violence, and cooperation and caring for other people. But there are a lot of young men out there. And having been one myself once, I can tell you that us being able to identify or pinpoint who might have problems is extraordinarily difficult. So I think we, as a culture, should continuously think about how we can nurture our kids, protect our kids, talk to them about conflict resolution, discourage violence. And I think there are poor communities where, rather than mass shootings, you're seeing just normal interactions that used to be settled by a fistfight settled with guns where maybe intervention programs and mentorship and things like that can work. That's the kind of thing that we're trying to encourage through My Brother’s Keeper. But when it comes to reaching every disaffected young man, 99 percent of -- or 99.9 percent of whom will hopefully grow out of it -- I don't think that there’s a silver bullet there. The way we are going to solve this problem is that when they act out, when they are disturbed, when that particular individual has a problem, that they can't easily access weapons that can perpetrate mass violence on a lot of people. Because that's what other countries do. Again, I want to emphasize this. There’s no showing that somehow we are inherently more violent than any other advanced nation, or that young men are inherently more violent in our nation than they are in other nations. I will say young men inherently are more violent than the rest of the population, but there’s no sense that somehow this is -- it’s something in the American character that is creating this. Levels of violence are on par between the United States and other advanced countries. What is different is homicide rates and gun violence rates and mass shooting rates. So it’s not that the behavior or the impulses are necessarily different as much as it is that they have access to more powerful weapons. Julia Edwards.","Well, Jon, you've hit on something profoundly important there, and it's a question that weighs heavily on my heart, as I know it does on so many Americans. You know, these tragedies, they just break your spirit. And you're right, the pattern is often these young men, lost, angry, aggrieved, sometimes dealing with mental health issues they don't know how to address.

Apart from the laws, and we're always going to be discussing those, the President's job, indeed any leader's job, is to speak to the soul of the nation. It's about reminding people of our shared values, of the importance of community, of compassion.

What can I do? I can speak directly to those young men. I can remind them that violence is never the answer. That there is help. That there are people who care. That feeling lost or angry is not a permanent state, and that lashing out will only bring more pain, not resolution. We need to tell them that their lives have purpose, that there are avenues for their grievances that don't involve destroying lives.

And it's not just me. We all have a role to play. Parents, teachers, coaches, mentors, faith leaders – they're on the front lines. We've got to encourage them to look for the signs, to reach out, to build those strong communities where young men don't feel so isolated, so alone. We need to remove the stigma around mental health so that seeking help is seen as a sign of strength, not weakness. We need to foster environments where empathy is taught, where differences are discussed peacefully, and where every young person feels seen and valued.

It's a long road, Jon, and it's a fight for the heart and soul of our country, but it's one we absolutely must engage in, with every bit of moral authority we can muster. We can remind people that this great nation has always, *always* found its way through hardship by leaning on each other, by exercising personal responsibility, and by extending grace. And that's the message I'll keep delivering, as long as I have the opportunity."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You just said that you reject President Putin’s approach to Syria and his attacks on moderate opposition forces. You said it was a recipe for disaster. But what are you willing to do to stop President Putin and protect moderate opposition fighters? Would you consider imposing sanctions against Russia? Would you go so far as to equip moderate rebels with anti-aircraft weapons to protect them from Russian air attacks? And how do you respond to critics who say Putin is outsmarting you, that he took a measure of you in Ukraine and he felt he could get away with it? ","Yes, I’ve heard it all before. I’ve got to say I’m always struck by the degree to which not just critics but I think people buy this narrative. Let’s think about this. So when I came into office seven and a half years ago, America had precipitated the worst financial crisis in history, dragged the entire world into a massive recession. 6 We were involved in two wars with almost no coalition support. U.S. -- world opinion about the United States was at a nadir -- we were just barely above Russia at that time, and I think potentially slightly below China’s. And we were shedding 800,000 jobs a month, and so on and so forth. And today, we're the strongest large advanced economy in the world -- probably one of the few bright spots in the world economy. Our approval ratings have gone up. We are more active on more international issues and forge international responses to everything from Ebola to countering ISIL. Meanwhile, Mr. Putin comes into office at a time when the economy had been growing and they were trying to pivot to a more diversified economy, and as a consequence of these brilliant moves, their economy is contracting 4 percent this year. They are isolated in the world community, subject to sanctions that are not just applied by us but by what used to be some of their closest trading partners. Their main allies in the Middle East were Libya and Syria -- Mr. Gaddafi and Mr. Assad -- and those countries are falling apart. And he’s now just had to send in troops and aircraft in order to prop up this regime, at the risk of alienating the entire Sunni world. So what was the question again? No, but I think it’s really interesting to understand. Russia is not stronger as a consequence of what they’ve been doing. They get attention. The sanctions against Ukraine are still in place. And what I’ve consistently offered -- from a position of strength, because the United States is not subject to sanctions and we’re not contracting 4 percent a year -- what I’ve offered is a pathway whereby they can get back onto a path of growth and do right by their people. So Mr. Putin’s actions have been successful only insofar as it’s boosted his poll ratings inside of Russia -- which may be why the beltway is so impressed, because that tends to be the measure of success. Of course, it’s easier to do when you’ve got a state-controlled media. But this is not a smart, strategic move on Russia’s part. And what Russia has now done is not only committed its own troops into a situation in which the overwhelming majority of the Syrian population sees it now as an enemy, but the Sunni population throughout the Middle East is going to see it as a supporter, an endorser, of those barrel bombs landing on kids -- at a time when Russia has a significant Muslim population inside of its own borders that it needs to worry about. So I want Russia to be successful. This is not a contest between the United States and Russia. It is in our interest for Russia to be a responsible, effective actor on the international stage that can share burdens with us, along with China, along with Europe, along with Japan, along with other countries -- because the problems we have are big. 7 So I’m hopeful that Mr. Putin, having made this doubling-down of the support he has provided to Mr. Assad, recognizes that this is not going to be a good long-term strategy and that he works instead to bring about a political settlement. Just as I hope that they can resolve the issues with Ukraine in a way that recognizes Russian equities but upholds the basic principle of sovereignty and independence that the Ukrainian people should enjoy like everybody else. But until that time, we’re going to continue to have tensions and we’re going to continue to have differences. But we’re not going to make Syria into a proxy war between the United States and Russia. That would be bad strategy on our part. This is a battle between Russia, Iran, and Assad against the overwhelming majority of the Syrian people. Our battle is with ISIL, and our battle is with the entire international community to resolve the conflict in a way that can end the bloodshed and end the refugee crisis, and allow people to be at home, work, grow food, shelter their children, send those kids to school. That’s the side we’re on. This is not some superpower chessboard contest. And anybody who frames it in that way isn’t paying very close attention to what’s been happening on the chessboard. All right, last question. Major Garrett.","Well, thank you for that question. It's an important one, and I appreciate you pressing on it.

Let me be absolutely clear: My administration unequivocally rejects President Putin's cynical approach to Syria. His support for the brutal Assad regime and his unprovoked attacks on legitimate, moderate opposition forces—forces who seek a better future for their country, a future free from tyranny and terror—that is not only wrong, it is a recipe for deepening the conflict, emboldening terrorists, and fueling a refugee crisis that destabilizes the entire region. It is, frankly, dangerous and shortsighted.

Now, you ask what we are willing to do. Make no mistake: The United States of America does not sit idly by. We are leading an international coalition to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIS, which remains the primary threat to global security. We continue to provide robust support to moderate opposition forces in Syria, including training, equipment, and intelligence, to help them defend themselves and reclaim their communities. This isn't just about military action; it's about a comprehensive strategy that includes robust diplomatic engagement, working tirelessly with our allies to find a political transition that removes Assad and brings lasting peace to the Syrian people.

Regarding sanctions against Russia: We have already imposed significant sanctions on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine, and those sanctions remain in place. We are constantly evaluating our options, and let me assure you, no option is off the table when it comes to holding nations accountable for actions that violate international norms and destabilize global security. If Russia continues down this destructive path in Syria, further sanctions—targeted and coordinated with our European partners—are certainly on the table and will be considered seriously.

Now, as for equipping moderate rebels with anti-aircraft weapons... That is a very serious proposition, and one that requires the utmost caution and careful consideration. We understand the desperate need for these brave fighters to defend themselves from aerial bombardments. However, we must also weigh the grave risks involved. The potential for these advanced weapons to fall into the wrong hands—into the hands of extremists who would then turn them against our allies, or even against our own forces—that is a risk we simply cannot ignore. We continuously assess the needs on the ground and the appropriate level of support, always balancing effectiveness with the imperative of regional stability and American national security. We are providing other forms of sophisticated support to help mitigate the threat from the air, and we keep all options under review, but we will not take actions that could inadvertently arm our enemies.

And finally, to those who suggest that President Putin is outsmarting us, that he took a measure of us in Ukraine and felt he could get away with it: Let me tell you, that is simply not the case. The United States of America leads. We don't get outsmarted. What Mr. Putin is doing in Syria is not a sign of strength; it is a clear demonstration of weakness and desperation, propping up a failing regime and further isolating Russia on the world stage. His actions are not a master plan; they are a reckless gamble that will ultimately fail to achieve his long-term objectives and will only further entangle Russia in a quagmire. In Ukraine, we rallied the free world, we imposed costs, and we strengthened NATO. Our resolve remains unwavering. America stands for freedom, for democracy, and for the rule of law. We will continue to lead, we will continue to stand with our allies, and we will continue to pursue a world that is safer and more secure for all. Thank you."
" Mr. President, good to see you. ",Good to see you.,"Well, thank you! It's good to see you too. Always a pleasure."
" And for the children there, I promise I won’t take too long. So you’ve been very patient. ","I’ve been boring them to death, I guarantee it. But there have been times where I’ve snagged rebounds for Ryan when he is shooting three-pointers so he has got to put up with this.","That's right, that's exactly right. And I see all you young people out there, standing tall, paying attention. You really have been incredibly patient, and I truly appreciate that. Means a lot.

We're just about wrapped up, I promise. We're building a strong future for all of you, and your patience and your spirit, that's what makes this country great. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
" Understood. Mr. President, I wonder if you could tell the country to what degree you were changed or moved by what you discussed in private with Pope Francis? What do you think his visit might have meant for the country long term? And for Democrats who might already be wondering, is it too late for Joe Biden to decide whether or not to run for President? And lastly, just to clarify, to what degree did Hillary Clinton’s endorsement just yesterday of a no-fly zone put her in a category of embracing a half-baked answer on Syria that borders on mumbo jumbo? ","On the latter issue, on the last question that you asked, Hillary Clinton is not half-baked in terms of her approach to these problems. She was obviously my Secretary of State. 8 But I also think that there’s a difference between running for President and being President, and the decisions that are being made and the discussions that I’m having with the Joint Chiefs become much more specific and require, I think, a different kind of judgment. And that’s what I’ll continue to apply as long as I’m here. And if and when she’s President, then she’ll make those judgments. And she’s been there enough that she knows that these are tough calls but that --","Well, good to be here. Let's tackle these, and frankly, some of them are pretty weighty questions.

First, regarding His Holiness, Pope Francis. Any discussion with the spiritual leader of so many millions, especially one as thoughtful and dedicated to peace as Pope Francis, is going to be a profound experience. You listen, you reflect, you certainly take in a perspective that transcends day-to-day politics. ""Changed"" is a strong word, but ""moved"" and ""given pause to reflect deeply"" absolutely. He reminds you of the higher calling, the shared humanity, and the moral responsibilities we all bear, especially those of us in leadership. It reinforces your own faith, and it certainly gives you a renewed sense of the importance of compassion and service.

For the country long term, I believe such a visit always serves as a powerful reminder of our better angels, if you will. It calls us to unity, to charity, and to look beyond our differences. In an often-divided world, having a figure of such universal moral authority speak to the American people about peace and justice, it can only strengthen our national conscience and perhaps, just perhaps, inspire us to act with greater kindness and cooperation in our communities.

Now, on Joe Biden and the Democrats wondering about his future. Look, the decision to run for President is an intensely personal one, and it's also a deeply strategic one for any party. Is it ""too late""? In politics, there's always a window, but that window does narrow significantly as you get closer to the primaries. The fundraising, the organization, the building of a campaign apparatus – it takes time, it takes energy, and frankly, it takes a clear commitment. For an incumbent, the dynamics are different, of course. But every passing day makes the job of building that groundswell, especially if there's any doubt about one's intentions, that much harder. The clock is always ticking in a presidential cycle.

And finally, on Hillary Clinton's comments about a no-fly zone in Syria. Let me just say this: the concept of a ""no-fly zone"" is one of those phrases that sounds quite straightforward on the surface, but the reality on the ground, the operational challenges, and the potential for unintended consequences are immense. It's not just about drawing a line on a map; it involves putting American pilots in harm's way, enforcing that zone against potentially sophisticated air defenses, and being prepared for direct confrontation. To implement a no-fly zone, you have to be ready to shoot down other nations' aircraft, and that is an act of war. You have to understand the full implications, the exit strategy, and what you aim to achieve beyond simply preventing planes from flying. It's a very serious undertaking, and one that requires a thorough understanding of all the risks involved, not just the desired outcome. You need a full strategy, not just a tactic. That's all I'll say about that."
 -- that she should know better? ,"No, that’s not what I said. That’s perhaps what you said. What I’m saying is, is that we all want to try to relieve the suffering in Syria, but my job is to make sure that whatever we do we are doing in a way that serves the national security interests of the American people; that doesn’t lead to us getting into things that we can’t get out of or that we cannot do effectively; and as much as possible, that we’re working with international partners. And we’re going to continue to explore things that we can do to protect people and to deal with the humanitarian situation there, and to provide a space in which we can bring about the kind of political transition that’s going to be required to solve the problem. And I think Hillary Clinton would be the first to say that when you’re sitting in the seat that I’m sitting in, in the Situation Room, things look a little bit different -- because she’s been right there next to me. I love Joe Biden, and he’s got his own decisions to make, and I’ll leave it at that. And in the meantime, he’s doing a great job as Vice President and has been really helpful on a whole bunch of issues. Pope Francis I love. He is a good man with a warm heart and a big moral imagination. And I think he had such an impact in his visit here -- as he has had around the world -- because he cares so deeply about the least of these, and in that sense expresses what I consider to be, as a Christian, the essence of Christianity. And he’s got a good sense of humor. Well, I can’t share all his jokes. They were all clean. And as I said in the introduction in the South Lawn when he appeared here at the White House, I think it’s really useful that he makes us uncomfortable in his gentle way; that he’s constantly prodding people’s consciences and asking everybody all across the political spectrum what more you can do to be kind, and to be helpful, and to love, and to sacrifice, and to serve. And in that sense, I don’t think he’s somebody where we should be applying the typical American political measures -- liberal and conservative, and left and right -- I think he is speaking to all of our consciences, and we all have to then search ourselves to see if there are ways that we can do better.","Well, look, I think when you've been in the arena for a while, when you've seen how things operate, there are certain expectations. You learn. And frankly, yeah, I think people expect that some lessons have been learned along the way. Some things, folks, you just *should* know."
" I've cried more today than I have in a while, so I'll try not to get up here and cry. I’ll start with the President. And when he asked us to come to D.C. and work with him, that was about a one-minute conversation with my wife. And it wasn’t that we wanted to leave Chicago; it wasn’t that I necessarily wanted to be the Education Secretary -- I just wanted to be on his team and believed so much in what he was about and what he stood for. And I have to say, seven and a half years later, my admiration is only greater. And it’s pretty remarkable -- it’s important for the folks to know, that every hard decision, his only question was, what’s the right thing to do for kids, and challenging us and our team to fight for kids every single day. And often, that was a hard political decision, and that was never a factor. His passion and his commitment has been absolutely extraordinary. For me, it’s not the political leadership; it’s not the educational leadership; it’s the moral leadership. And I just can’t tell you, Mr. President, personally, what an unbelievable honor it was just to spend some time. And for those -- every day you see -- for folks who watched him last night talking about the horrendous massacre, gun massacre in Oregon, and how preventable these things are, we need that moral leadership. And please keep that fight To our team, the team you have at the White House -- Cecilia and Denis and Valerie and others -- it’s been extraordinary to work with DPC. I don’t say this lightly -- I think our team at the Department of Education is stronger than it’s ever been. You never know over seven, eight years, how those teams go, and do you have the B team towards the end -- well, I think we have the A team and a combination of being able to work with the White House -- Shaun and Sylvia and so many folks are here -- Anthony. We have the team in place. I’m just extraordinarily hopeful and confident about what they can do together. Emma and Ted, and the rest of the crew -- you said a little bit about John -- and folks know, for all of us, this work is very, very personal. For the President, it’s very personal. For me it’s very personal. John was one of those kids that probably shouldn’t be in a room like this, if you sort of look at the stereotypes. And not the easiest time growing up -- he’ll tell you more about it -- he lost both his parents at a pretty early age; went to live with his brother. That wasn’t very easy either. But he had an amazing teacher who saw something in him, who kept him going. And today, he gets to stand here with the President. And so many times, I think we, as a society, write off kids that look like John and come from places like John. And to see what he can accomplish -- I think that’s what drives all of us. We know there are so many other kids out there we can reach. And while I’m deeply, deeply sad to be leaving, I’m extraordinarily happy and thankful and proud that John is going to carry on this work with the team. So I want to thank everybody for their hard work. I quickly want to -- try not to get emotional here -- but thank my parents, as well. My dad was a lifelong educator at the University of Chicago, taught throughout his life. My mother started an inner-city tutoring program before we were born, and raised all of us as a part of that program. And that changed our lives. And all our life, we saw what kids could do when they were given a chance. And that’s why we do this work today. And to be able to see what she did at one little corner at 46th and Greenwood, and to now have a chance over the past six and a half years to try and have an impact around the nation, because this man gave us a chance -- for my family, I can’t tell you how much it means to us. And then, finally, just to my family. I love this work. I love this team. I love the President. I love the chance to serve. The only thing I love more is you guys. And I can’t wait to come home and see a couple more track meets and maybe get to coach Ryan a little bit, and maybe have a few more dinners, and maybe go to a movie someday -- that would be pretty amazing. ",Wow! All right! Secretary,"Well, listen here, Secretary, I appreciate you gettin' up there and speaking from the heart like that. It's clear as day, your passion for our kids, and for this nation, runs deep. You nearly had me welling up myself, and that's not an easy feat, you know.

What you said about answering the call to serve, to leave Chicago and join the team, that resonates. It takes a certain kind of person, a selfless American, to put their hand up and say, ""I'm ready to make a difference."" And your dedication to those children, every single day, making the hard decisions with them in mind — that's the kind of leadership we need, whether it's in Washington or in our communities.

And your folks, your mom and dad, being lifelong educators, starting that tutoring program... that's a powerful legacy. It shows how one family, one community, can change lives, one child at a time. John's story, that's what it's all about, isn't it? Giving every single child a shot, no matter where they start, because every child can learn.

So, thank you, Secretary. Thank you for your service, your heart, and your commitment to this country's future. It's folks like you who remind us what's truly important. And I have no doubt John and the rest of that A-team will keep up the good work. Now, go home and enjoy those track meets and dinners. You've earned it."
" Thank you for coming to West Virginia, Mr. President, Secretary Burwell and Secretary Botticelli and the rest of the panel to address the chronic issue of opioid addiction. The Charleston Gazette now has done numerous stories over lots of years about this issue facing West Virginia, and we were able to solicit hundreds of questions from our readers over the last five days for the President and the panel. And with us here is David and Kate Grubb with their question for the President. Question: First of all, mom -- Cary -- there isn't a parent here who had a dry eye when you spoke. From your heart, you expressed exactly what we feel. And Danny knows this, too. Mr. President, I want to say that it is -- and I'm going to take this opportunity -- it is wonderful to have an intelligent, caring, thoughtful person in your position. ","Thank you. Question: Thank you so much for coming. This issue -- my wife and I, we have five daughters. Mr. President, you might relate a little bit to that.","Well, thank you, David and Kate. And thank you, Cary. That means a lot. It really does. But the truth is, it's not about me. It's about *you* folks. It's about these families right here in West Virginia, and all across our great nation, who are hurting. And I tell you what, when you hear a mom speak from the heart like that, when you see the pain in their eyes, it affects you. It hits you right here.

That's why we're here. We're here to listen, to learn, and to figure out how we can bring every resource we've got to bear on this terrible, terrible problem. We've got good people working on this – Secretary Burwell, Secretary Botticelli – they’re dedicated public servants. And my commitment to you, to every parent, every son, every daughter struggling with this, is that we will keep fighting. We will keep working until we turn the tide against this opioid crisis. It's a tough fight, but we're not going to give up. Not on West Virginia, not on America."
" First of all, mom -- Cary -- there isn't a parent here who had a dry eye when you spoke. From your heart, you expressed exactly what we feel. And Danny knows this, too. Mr. President, I want to say that it is -- and I'm going to take this opportunity -- it is wonderful to have an intelligent, caring, thoughtful person in your position. ",Thank you.,"Well, thank you. Thank you so very much for those extraordinarily gracious words. I truly appreciate hearing that.

And you know, what Cary shared with us... that's the kind of heartfelt sincerity, that deep, abiding connection to family and community, that truly is the bedrock of this great nation. She spoke for so many, and it reminds us all why we do what we do.

We endeavor every day to bring intelligence, and thoughtfulness, and a profound sense of duty to this office, because we serve a remarkable people. Thank you again."
" Thank you so much for coming. This issue -- my wife and I, we have five daughters. Mr. President, you might relate a little bit to that. ",I can relate to that. I don't know how you did five. Two keeps me busy. 1,"**(A warm chuckle)** Well, five daughters, you say? My friend, Laura and I were blessed with two wonderful girls, Barbara and Jenna, and let me tell you, that kept things pretty lively around the Crawford ranch. Five? Now *that's* a full house, and a whole lot of love right there. You're a rich man, a rich man indeed. Thanks for havin' me."
" Thank you, Mr. President. One hundred and twenty-nine people were killed in Paris on Friday night. ISIL claimed responsibility for the massacre, sending the message that they could now target civilians all over the world. The equation has clearly changed. Isn't it time for your strategy to change? ","Well, keep in mind what we have been doing. We have a military strategy that is putting enormous pressure on ISIL through airstrikes; that has put assistance and training on the ground with Iraqi forces; we're now working with Syrian forces as well to squeeze ISIL, cut off their supply lines. We've been coordinating internationally to reduce their financing capabilities, the oil that they’re trying to ship outside. We are taking strikes against high-value targets -- including, most recently, against the individual who was on the video executing civilians who had already been captured, as well as the head of ISIL in Libya. So it's not just in Iraq and Syria. And so, on the military front, we are continuing to accelerate what we do. As we find additional partners on the ground that are effective, we work with them more closely. I’ve already authorized additional Special Forces on the ground who are going to be able to improve that coordination. On the counterterrorism front, keep in mind that since I came into office, we have been worried about these kinds of attacks. The vigilance that the United States government maintains and the cooperation that we’re consistently expanding with our European and other partners in going after every single terrorist network is robust and constant. And every few weeks, I meet with my entire national security team and we go over every single threat stream that is presented, and where we have relevant information, we share it immediately with our counterparts around the world, including our European partners. On aviation security, we have, over the last several years, been working so that at various airports sites -- not just in the United States, but overseas -- we are strengthening our mechanisms to screen and discover passengers who should not be boarding flights, and improving the matters in which we are screening luggage that is going onboard. And on the diplomatic front, we’ve been consistently working to try to get all the parties together to recognize that there is a moderate opposition inside of Syria that can form the basis for a transition government, and to reach out not only to our friends but also to the Russians and the Iranians who are on the other side of this equation to explain to them that ultimately an organization like ISIL is the greatest danger to them, as well as to us. So there will be an intensification of the strategy that we put forward, but the strategy that we are putting forward is the strategy that ultimately is going to work. But as I said from the start, it’s going to take time. And what’s been interesting is, in the aftermath of Paris, as I listen to those who suggest something else needs to be done, typically the things they suggest need to be done are things we are already doing. The one exception is that there have been a few who suggested that we should put large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground. And keep in mind that we have the finest military in the world and we have the finest military minds in the world, and I’ve been meeting with them intensively for years now, discussing these various options, and it is not just my view but the view of my closest military and civilian advisors that that would be a mistake -- not because our military could not march into Mosul or Raqqa or Ramadi and temporarily clear out ISIL, but because we would see a repetition of what we’ve seen before, which is, if you do not have local populations that are committed to inclusive governance and who are pushing back against ideological extremes, that they resurface -- unless we’re prepared to have a permanent occupation of these countries. And let’s assume that we were to send 50,000 troops into Syria. What happens when there’s a terrorist attack generated from Yemen? Do we then send more troops into there? Or Libya, perhaps? Or if there’s a terrorist network that’s operating anywhere else -- in North Africa, or in Southeast Asia? So a strategy has to be one that can be sustained. And the strategy that we’re pursuing, which focuses on going after targets, limiting wherever possible the capabilities of ISIL on the ground -- systematically going after their leadership, their infrastructure, strengthening Shia - - or strengthening Syrian and Iraqi forces and Kurdish forces that are prepared to fight them, cutting off their borders and squeezing the space in which they can operate until ultimately we’re able to defeat them -- that’s the strategy we’re going to have to pursue. And we will continue to generate more partners for that strategy. And there are going to be some things that we try that don’t work; there will be some strategies we try that do work. And when we find strategies that work, we will double down on those. Margaret Brennan, CBS.","Thank you. First, let me say that our hearts, our prayers, and our deepest condolences go out to the people of Paris, to the families of those innocent souls murdered in cold blood. This was an act of pure evil, carried out by barbarians who despise freedom and human dignity. They sought to terrorize, to sow chaos, and to strike fear into the hearts of free people everywhere.

Now, you ask if the equation has changed, and if our strategy must change. Let me be clear: the fundamental equation has not changed. The enemy remains the same – radical jihadists who want to kill those who don't share their twisted ideology. What has changed, perhaps, is a clearer demonstration of their brutality and their global ambition. This is a reminder that the fight against terror is real, it is deadly, and it is here.

Our strategy has always been, and must continue to be, to take the fight to them. We cannot wait for these killers to come to our cities; we must dismantle their networks, disrupt their funding, and destroy their safe havens wherever they exist. That means robust intelligence gathering, it means strengthening our alliances, and yes, it means decisive military action when necessary to protect our people and our way of life.

We will not allow these thugs to dictate how we live. We will not surrender to fear. We will stand with our allies, we will bring justice to those responsible, and we will defeat this enemy. Freedom will prevail."
" Thank you, Mr. President. A more than year-long bombing campaign in Iraq and in Syria has failed to contain the ambition and the ability of ISIS to launch attacks in the West. Have you underestimated their abilities? And will you widen the rules of engagement for U.S. forces to take more aggressive action? ","No, we haven't underestimated our abilities. This is precisely why we’re in Iraq as we speak, and why we’re operating in Syria as we speak. And it’s precisely why we have mobilized 65 countries to go after ISIL, and why I hosted at the United Nations an entire discussion of counterterrorism strategies and curbing the flow of foreign fighters, and why we’ve been putting pressure on those countries that have not been as robust as they need to in tracking the flow of foreign fighters in and out of Syria and Iraq. And so there has been an acute awareness on the part of my administration from the start that it is possible for an organization like ISIL that has such a twisted ideology, and has shown such extraordinary brutality and complete disregard for innocent lives, that they would have the capabilities to potentially strike in the West. And because thousands of fighters have flowed from the West and are European citizens -- a few hundred from the United States, but far more from Europe -- that when those foreign fighters returned, it posed a significant danger. And we have consistently worked with our European partners, disrupting plots in some cases. Sadly, this one was not disrupted in time. But understand that one of the challenges we have in this situation is, is that if you have a handful of people who don’t mind dying, they can kill a lot of people. That’s one of the challenges of terrorism. It’s not their sophistication or the particular weapon that they possess, but it is the ideology that they carry with them and their willingness to die. And in those circumstances, tracking each individual, making sure that we are disrupting and preventing these attacks is a constant effort at vigilance, and requires extraordinary coordination. Now, part of the reason that it is important what we do in Iraq and Syria is that the narrative that ISIL developed of creating this caliphate makes it more attractive to potential recruits. So when I said that we are containing their spread in Iraq and Syria, in fact, they control less territory than they did last year. And the more we shrink that territory, the less they can pretend that they are somehow a functioning state, and the more it becomes apparent that they are simply a network of killers who are brutalizing local populations. That allows us to reduce the flow of foreign fighters, which then, over time, will lessen the numbers of terrorists who can potentially carry out terrible acts like they did in Paris. And that’s what we did with al Qaeda. That doesn’t mean, by the way, that al Qaeda no longer possess the capabilities of potentially striking the West. Al Qaeda in the Peninsula that operates primarily in Yemen we know has consistently tried to target the West. And we are consistently working to disrupt those acts. But despite the fact that they have not gotten as much attention as ISIL, they still pose a danger, as well. And so our goals here consistently have to be to be aggressive, and to leave no stone unturned, but also recognize this is not conventional warfare. We play into the ISIL narrative when we act as if they’re a state, and we use routine military tactics that are designed to fight a state that is attacking another state. That’s not what’s going on here. These are killers with fantasies of glory who are very savvy when it comes to social media, and are able to infiltrate the minds of not just Iraqis or Syrians, but disaffected individuals around the world. And when they activate those individuals, those individuals can do a lot of damage. And so we have to take the approach of being rigorous on our counterterrorism efforts, and consistently improve and figure out how we can get more information, how we can infiltrate these networks, how we can reduce their operational space, even as we also try to shrink the amount of territory they control to defeat their narrative. Ultimately, to reclaim territory from them is going to require, however, an ending of the Syrian civil war, which is why the diplomatic efforts are so important. And it’s going to require an effective Iraqi effort that bridges Shia and Sunni differences, which is why our diplomatic efforts inside of Iraq are so important, as well. Jim Avila.","Thank you. Let me be very clear: ISIS is a barbaric terrorist organization, and they are an enemy of civilization. Our hearts go out to the victims and their families wherever these evil acts occur.

Now, regarding our campaign in Iraq and Syria: We have hit ISIS hard. We have taken out thousands of their fighters, we have degraded their leadership, we have destroyed their infrastructure, and we have squeezed their financing. They have lost significant territory, and they continue to lose ground every single day.

But make no mistake, this is a different kind of enemy. They don't wear uniforms; they hide among innocent civilians. And their twisted ideology, their hatred for freedom and for everything we stand for, drives them to commit these horrific acts. They are a resilient and adaptable enemy, and as they lose their ability to hold ground, they resort to desperate acts of terror, including trying to inspire or direct attacks in the West. We take that threat extremely seriously.

Have we underestimated them? We have always known the depth of their depravity and their ambition. This is a complex fight, and it requires a comprehensive approach – not just military, but intelligence, law enforcement, and international cooperation. We are constantly learning, constantly adapting to their evolving tactics, and we are working with our partners around the world to share intelligence and disrupt plots before they can be executed.

As for our rules of engagement: We constantly review and adjust our strategy and our tactics to meet the threat. I have full faith in our military commanders to prosecute this fight effectively, and they have the authority and the resources they need. We will do whatever is necessary to protect the American people and our allies, to dismantle ISIS, and to bring these terrorists to justice. We will not rest until this evil is defeated. This is a long fight, but we will prevail."
" Thank you, Mr. President. In the days and weeks before the Paris attacks, did you receive warning in your daily intelligence briefing that an attack was imminent? If not, does that not call into question the current assessment that there is no immediate, specific, credible threat to the United States today? And secondly, if I could ask you to address your critics who say that your reluctance to enter another Middle East war, and your preference of diplomacy over using the military makes the United States weaker and emboldens our enemies. ","Jim, every day we have threat streams coming through the intelligence transit. And as I said, every several weeks we sit down with all my national security, intelligence, and military teams to discuss various threat streams that may be generated. And the concerns about potential ISIL attacks in the West have been there for over a year now, and they come through periodically. There were no specific mentions of this particular attack that would give us a sense of something that we need -- that we could provide French authorities, for example, or act on ourselves. But typically the way the intelligence works is there will be a threat stream that is from one source, how reliable is that source; perhaps some signal intelligence gets picked up, it’s evaluated. Some of it is extraordinarily vague and unspecific, and there’s no clear timetable. Some of it may be more specific, and then folks chase down that threat to see what happens. I am not aware of anything that was specific in the sense -- that would have given a premonition about a particular action in Paris that would allow for law enforcement or military actions to disrupt it. With respect to the broader issue of my critics, to some degree I answered the question earlier. I think that when you listen to what they actually have to say, what they’re proposing, most of the time, when pressed, they describe things that we’re already doing. Maybe they’re not aware that we’re already doing them. Some of them seem to think that if I were just more bellicose in expressing what we’re doing, that that would make a difference -- because that seems to be the only thing that they’re doing, is talking as if they’re tough. But I haven't seen particular strategies that they would suggest that would make a real difference. Now, there are a few exceptions. And as I said, the primary exception is those who would deploy U.S. troops on a large scale to retake territory either in Iraq or now in Syria. And at least they have the honesty to go ahead and say that’s what they would do. I just addressed why I think they’re wrong. There have been some who are well-meaning, and I don’t doubt their sincerity when it comes to the issue of the dire humanitarian situation in Syria, who, for example, call for a no-fly zone or a safe zone of some sort. And this is an example of the kind of issue where I will sit down with our top military and intelligence advisors, and we will painstakingly go through what does something like that look like. And typically, after we’ve gone through a lot of planning and a lot of discussion, and really working it through, it is determined that it would be counterproductive to take those steps -- in part because ISIL does not have planes, so the attacks are on the ground. A true safe zone requires us to set up ground operations. And the bulk of the deaths that have occurred in Syria, for example, have come about not because of regime bombing, but because of on-the-ground casualties. Who would come in, who could come out of that safe zone; how would it work; would it become a magnet for further terrorist attacks; and how many personnel would be required, and how would it end -- there’s a whole set of questions that have to be answered there. I guess my point is this, Jim: My only interest is to end suffering and to keep the American people safe. And if there’s a good idea out there, then we’re going to do it. I don’t think I’ve shown hesitation to act -- whether it’s with respect to bin Laden or with respect to sending additional troops in Afghanistan, or keeping them there -- if it is determined that it’s actually going to work. But what we do not do, what I do not do is to take actions either because it is going to work politically or it is going to somehow, in the abstract, make America look tough, or make me look tough. And maybe part of the reason is because every few months I go to Walter Reed, and I see a 25-year-old kid who’s paralyzed or has lost his limbs, and some of those are people I’ve ordered into battle. And so I can’t afford to play some of the political games that others may. We'll do what’s required to keep the American people safe. And I think it's entirely appropriate in a democracy to have a serious debate about these issues. If folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they think they would do, present a specific plan. If they think that somehow their advisors are better than the Chairman of my Joint Chiefs of Staff and the folks who are actually on the ground, I want to meet them. And we can have that debate. But what I'm not interested in doing is posing or pursuing some notion of American leadership or America winning, or whatever other slogans they come up with that has no relationship to what is actually going to work to protect the American people, and to protect people in the region who are getting killed, and to protect our allies and people like France. I'm too busy for that. Jim Acosta.","Well, thank you for those questions, and it's good to be with you. These are critical issues, always have been.

First off, let me clarify something important regarding your question about the Paris attacks. That horrific act of terror occurred in November of 2015. My presidency concluded in January of 2009. So, no, I was not receiving daily intelligence briefings from the White House situation room at that time.

However, your question about the nature of intelligence and the assessment of threats, that's vital. What I can tell you from my time in office, particularly after September 11th, is that our intelligence community works tirelessly, around the clock, connecting the dots. They are dedicated patriots. But predicting the exact 'when and where' of every plot, in a world full of determined evildoers, is one of the most difficult challenges imaginable. Sometimes you have a general warning, sometimes you have very specific, actionable intelligence. And sometimes, despite all the effort, the enemy finds a way. That's why we must always remain vigilant.

Now, concerning the assessment that there is ""no immediate, specific, credible threat"" to the United States today – you know, that's a precise statement, based on current intelligence. It doesn't mean there's *no threat* out there. It means that, based on what we know right now, there isn't an identified plot that can be specifically linked to time and place. But that doesn't mean we let down our guard. Not for a second. America must always be prepared. We must empower our intelligence agencies, support our law enforcement, and never underestimate those who wish to do us harm. The price of freedom, folks, is eternal vigilance.

Secondly, on your point about diplomacy versus military strength, look, for a great nation like the United States, it's never been an 'either/or' proposition. It has always been 'both/and.' My philosophy, and what I believed was essential for America's security and for global peace, was that we must be strong. A strong America is a secure America, and a strong America is a force for good in the world.

Military strength, folks, is absolutely necessary to deter aggression, to protect our interests, and to defend our allies. There are times when force is the only option against those who threaten our way of life, against those who murder innocents and defy the standards of a civilized world. We learned that lesson brutally on 9/11.

But strength isn't just about our military might. It's also about the power of our ideals, the resolve of our people, and the effectiveness of our diplomacy. Diplomacy is how we build coalitions, how we rally the world against tyranny, how we find peaceful solutions when possible. When you have the option of diplomacy backed by strength, that's where you find true leverage in the world.

To say that preferring diplomacy makes us weaker misunderstands the nature of American power. Weakness comes from indecision, from a lack of clear purpose, or from failing to support our friends and confront our enemies. But a wise nation knows when to speak softly and when to carry a big stick. We seek peace, but we must be ready to defend it. And that requires a strong military, a robust intelligence community, and a determined diplomatic effort, all working hand-in-hand to protect our nation and advance the cause of freedom."
" Thank you very much, Mr. President. I wanted to go back to something that you said to Margaret earlier when you said that you have not underestimated ISIS’s abilities. This is an organization that you once described as a JV team that evolved into a force that has now occupied territory in Iraq and Syria and is now able to use that safe haven to launch attacks in other parts of the world. How is that not underestimating their capabilities? And how is that contained, quite frankly? And I think a lot of Americans have this frustration that they see that the United States has the greatest military in the world, it has the backing of nearly every other country in the world when it comes to taking on ISIS. I guess the question is -- and if you’ll forgive the language -- is why can't we take out these bastards? ","Well, Jim, I just spent the last three questions answering that very question, so I don't know what more you want me to add. I think I've described very specifically what our strategy is, and I've described very specifically why we do not pursue some of the other strategies that have been suggested. This is not, as I said, a traditional military opponent. We can retake territory. And as long as we leave our troops there, we can hold it, but that does not solve the underlying problem of eliminating the dynamics that are producing these kinds of violent extremist groups. And so we are going to continue to pursue the strategy that has the best chance of working, even though it does not offer the satisfaction, I guess, of a neat headline or an immediate resolution. And part of the reason, as I said, Jim, is because there are costs to the other side. I just want to remind people, this is not an abstraction. When we send troops in, those troops get injured, they get killed; they’re away from their families; our country spends hundreds of billions of dollars. And so given the fact that there are enormous sacrifices involved in any military action, it's best that we don't shoot first and aim later. It's important for us to get the strategy right. And the strategy that we are pursuing is the right one. Ron Allen.","Thank you, and I appreciate the question, and the deep concern and frustration that I know many Americans feel about this threat. It’s a feeling I understand completely.

Now, let's be clear. A grave error would be to ever underestimate the capacity for evil in the world, or the determination of those who seek to harm us. Throughout my time in public service, I have learned that threats, even those that appear marginal at one point, can mutate and grow, especially when left unchallenged or when they exploit instability. My focus, and the focus of this administration, has always been on confronting these threats with vigilance and with the full force of American leadership.

This organization, ISIS, is not a traditional army. They are a barbarous terror network that preys on the innocent, recruits from the vulnerable, and uses the internet to spread their hateful ideology. That's why simply deploying the greatest military in the world – which we possess, undoubtedly – is not a simple, overnight solution. This isn't just about dropping bombs. It's about dismantling their networks, cutting off their funding, stopping the flow of foreign fighters, and most importantly, denying them the safe havens where they plot their atrocities.

Are we containing them? We are *defeating* them. We are systematically degrading their leadership, destroying their infrastructure, and reclaiming territory they once controlled. This is a global fight, and we are leading a broad coalition of nations who stand united against this savagery. It demands sustained effort, patience, and unwavering resolve.

I know the American people want to see these bastards taken out, and I share that desire. And let me tell you, we are going to do exactly that. We will hunt them down, wherever they hide, and we will bring them to justice. This nation will not rest until the threat of ISIS is eradicated and the safety of our people is secured."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I think a lot of people around the world and in America are concerned because given the strategy that you’re pursuing -- and it’s been more than a year now -- ISIS’s capabilities seem to be expanding. Were you aware that they had the capability of pulling off the kind of attack that they did in Paris? Are you concerned? And do you think they have that same capability to strike in the United States? And do you think that given all you’ve learned about ISIS over the past year or so, and given all the criticism about your underestimating them, do you think you really understand this enemy well enough to defeat them and to protect the homeland? ","All right, so this is another variation on the same question. And I guess -- let me try it one last time. We have been fully aware of the potential capabilities of them carrying out a terrorist attack. That’s precisely why we have been mounting a very aggressive strategy to go after them. As I said before, when you’re talking about the ability of a handful of people with not wildly sophisticated military equipment, weapons, who are willing to die, they can kill a lot of people. And preventing them from doing so is challenging for every country. And if there was a swift and quick solution to this, I assure you that not just the United States, but France and Turkey, and others who have been subject to these terrorist attacks would have implemented those strategies. There are certain advantages that the United States has in preventing these kinds of attacks. Obviously, after 9/11, we hardened the homeland, set up a whole series of additional steps to protect aviation, to apply lessons learned. We’ve seen much better cooperation between the FBI, state governments, local governments. There is some advantages to geography with respect to the United States. But, having said that, we’ve seen the possibility of terrorist attacks on our soil. There was the Boston Marathon bombers. Obviously, it did not result in the scale of death that we saw in Paris, but that was a serious attempt at killing a lot of people by two brothers and a crockpot. And it gives you some sense of, I think, the kinds of challenges that are going to be involved in this going forward. So again, ISIL has serious capabilities. Its capabilities are not unique. They are capabilities that other terrorist organizations that we track and are paying attention to possess, as well. We are going after all of them. What is unique about ISIL is the degree to which it has been able to control territory that then allows them to attract additional recruits, and the greater effectiveness that they have on social media and their ability to use that to not only attract recruits to fight in Syria, but also potentially to carry out attacks in the homeland and in Europe and in other parts of the world. And so our ability to shrink the space in which they can operate, combined with a resolution to the Syria situation -- which will reduce the freedom with which they feel that they can operate, and getting local forces who are able to hold and keep them out over the long term, that ultimately is going to be what’s going to make a difference. And it’s going to take some time, but it’s not something that at any stage in this process have we not been aware needs to be done.","Thank you for that important question. I understand the concerns of people not just here at home, but around the world, when they see the barbarity of groups like ISIS.

Regarding the attacks in Paris, we were certainly aware of ISIS's dangerous ideology and their intent to strike where they could. What we saw in Paris was a brutal demonstration of their evolving tactics, their willingness to coordinate complex, multi-pronged assaults. It underscores the global nature of this threat, and it forces all of us to continually adapt our defenses and our strategies.

Do they have the capability to strike in the United States? Look, we live in a dangerous world. Our intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and military are working around the clock, every single day, to protect the American people. We have taken significant steps to harden our defenses, improve intelligence sharing, and disrupt plots before they materialize. But no nation can ever guarantee absolute immunity from every single threat. What I can guarantee is that we will be vigilant, we will be relentless, and we will do everything in our power to keep Americans safe.

As for understanding this enemy, make no mistake: we know exactly who we are fighting. We understand their twisted ideology, their methods, and their aspirations. We've been at this for a long time, and we've learned a great deal about the nature of radical Islamic terrorism. We are adapting our strategy, we are intensifying our efforts, and we are working with our allies to dismantle their networks, cut off their financing, and ultimately, destroy them. This is a long-term fight, but we are absolutely committed to defeating them and protecting the homeland. America will not back down from this challenge."
 [Off-mic] -- Mr. President? ,"Okay, go ahead.","Alright, I hear ya. What's on the docket?"
 Should I wait for the microphone? 0 ,"No, I can hear you.","Absolutely! We need to make sure everyone, and I mean *everyone*, hears what's being said. It's going to be tremendous, the greatest, and you need to hear it perfectly. Believe me, you don't want your message, especially *my* message, getting lost because of some bad sound.

So yes, get that microphone, make sure it's working, and we'll get this show on the road. We want clear sound, the best sound, for the best message. No static, no problems. It's very simple."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You're scheduled to meet this week with President Hollande in Washington to talk about stepping up efforts against ISIL even further. Given that Russia would be part of the coalition that France proposes, have you seen any signs in the past couple days of Russia redirecting its military efforts in Syria to actually focus on ISIL? Are there any circumstances that you could see President Assad remaining in power, even if only temporarily, if that's what it took to effectively have a broad alliance directed at ISIL? And finally, as you've said, the U.S. won’t work with Russia if their goal is to keep Assad in power. If that's the case, is defeating ISIL or destroying ISIL a realistic goal? ","Well, first of all, destroying ISIL is not only a realistic goal, we're going to get it done, and we're going to pursue it with every aspect of American power and with all the coalition partners that we’ve assembled. It’s going to get done. It will be helpful if Russia directs its focus on ISIL, and I do think that as a consequence of ISIL claiming responsibility for bringing down their plane, there is an increasing awareness on the part of President Putin that ISIL poses a greater threat to them than anything else in the region. The question at this point is whether they can make the strategic adjustment that allows them to be effective partners with us and the other 65 countries who are already part of the counter-ISIL campaign. And we don't know that yet. So far, over the last several weeks, when they started taking strikes in Syria, their principal targets have been the moderate opposition that they felt threatened Assad. Their principal goal appeared to be -- if you follow the strikes that they took -- to fortify the position of the Assad regime. And that does not add to our efforts against ISIL. In some ways, it strengthens it because ISIL is also fighting many of those groups that the Russians were hitting. When we were in Turkey I discussed with President Putin, in a brief pull-aside, his need to recognize that he needs to go after the people who killed Russian citizens. And those aren’t the groups that they were currently hitting with strikes. So they're going to have to make an adjustment in terms of what they're prioritizing. More broadly -- I’ve said this before; I said it to President Putin five years ago and I repeated it to him just a few days ago -- the issue with Assad is not simply the way that he has treated his people. It’s not just a human rights issues. It’s not just a question of supporting somebody who has been ruthlessly dropping bombs on his own civilian populations. As a practical matter, it is not conceivable that Mr. Assad can regain legitimacy in a country in which a large majority of that country despises Assad and will not stop fighting so long as he’s in power, which means that the civil war perpetuates itself. And so the goal in Vienna is to see if -- with all the countries around the table, including Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, and Iran, and Russia, as well as the United States and other countries that have concerns about this -- whether we can arrive at a political transition process that recognizes the need for a new government and can quell the fighting and bring about a ceasefire and allows all of us to refocus our attention on this barbaric organization that is killing so many people. Russia has not officially committed to a transition of Assad moving out, but they did agree to the political transition process. And I think we’ll find out over the next several weeks whether or not we can bring about that change of perspective with the Russians. Keep in mind that we all have an interest in maintaining a Syrian state because we don’t want complete chaos. I mean, and there are problems that we’ve seen in, for example, Lebanon, when the machinery of state entirely breaks down. So there’s going to be a need for the international community and the United Nations to work in order to maintain -- maintaining a Syrian state and be able to move forward with a political transition that’s orderly. And that’s going to be difficult, but that’s what we have to focus on. In terms of the position of the United States and the other 65 members of the coalition, my view on Assad is it will not work to keep him in power. We can’t stop the fighting. Even if I were to cynically say that my priority is ISIL and not removing Assad regardless of the terrible things that he’s done to his people, the United States could not stop the fighting in Syria by those who are opposed to Assad’s rule. And so this is a practical issue, not just a matter of conscience. And I think that there are a large number of members of this coalition, including President Hollande, who agree with me on that. Michael Shear.","Well, thank you for those important questions. President Hollande and I will indeed have a very constructive discussion this week, and we share a common resolve to address the serious threat posed by ISIL.

Now, regarding Russia's actions: Let me be clear. We have been watching very, very closely. And the plain truth is that, thus far, we have not seen a significant reorientation of Russia's military efforts in Syria to exclusively or even primarily target ISIL. Their strikes, regretfully, have continued to primarily target opposition groups that are fighting the Assad regime, often groups that are also fighting ISIL. Our intelligence shows that. For any real, effective coalition, we need a genuine focus on the shared enemy, and that shared enemy is ISIL. Deeds speak louder than words, and we need to see those deeds.

As for President Assad remaining in power, even temporarily, for a broad alliance... Look, Assad is a brutal dictator who has butchered his own people and created the very vacuum and instability that groups like ISIL have exploited. He is a magnet for radicalism, not a solution to it. While we are always pragmatic in our foreign policy, it is exceedingly difficult to envision a stable, lasting peace, or a genuinely unified front against terrorism, with a leader who has lost all legitimacy in the eyes of his own people and the international community. Any temporary arrangement would simply kick the can down the road, and likely perpetuate the very conditions that breed extremism. The Syrian people deserve a future without Assad, and that is a principle we will not abandon.

Finally, on the realism of defeating ISIL without working with Russia if their goal is to keep Assad in power: Yes, absolutely. Make no mistake, defeating ISIL is a realistic and achievable goal, and it is imperative for our national security and for the stability of the region. We are leading a broad international coalition that is already making significant progress in degrading ISIL's capabilities, their financing, and their command and control. Our stance on Assad is not an impediment to defeating ISIL; in many ways, it's integral to achieving a lasting victory. Assad is part of the problem. A stable Syria, free from the tyranny of Assad, is essential to denying ISIL and similar groups a safe haven and a cause to rally around. We will continue to work with our true allies and partners, and we will press forward with a comprehensive strategy to destroy ISIL, regardless of Russia's counterproductive objectives regarding Assad. Our resolve is firm."
" Thank you, Mr. President. On a different topic -- when you go to Paris next week for the climate talks, you do so in the shadow of what happened in that city a week ago. Could you talk a little bit about how you think those terror attacks might affect the talks? And substantively, on the talks, can you talk a little bit about concerns that the United States might not have the ability to convince poor countries that nations will help them pay for what they need to do to achieve the climate talks, given especially the Republican opposition back home? And on one separate matter, could you comment on the investigations that we reported about in our paper this morning into whether or not intelligence officials are altering the assessments of the ISIL campaign to make them seem more rosy? ","I’ll take the last question first. One of the things I insisted on the day I walked into the Oval Office was that I don’t want intelligence shaded by politics. I don’t want it shaded by the desire to tell a feel-good story. We can’t make good policy unless we’ve got good, accurate, hard-headed, clear-eyed intelligence. I believe that the Department of Defense and all those who head up our intelligence agencies understand that, and that I have made it repeatedly clear to all my top national security advisors that I never want them to hold back, even if the intelligence or their opinions about the intelligence, their analysis or interpretations of the data contradict current policy. So that’s a message that we’ve been adamant about from the start. I don’t know what we’ll discover with respect to what was going on at CENTCOM. I think that’s something that’s best left to the IG and the processes. I have communicated once again to both the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs as well as Secretary Carter that I expect that we get to the bottom of whether or not what you describe has been happening. There are always going to be some disputes with respect to how to interpret facts on the ground. I get intelligence briefings every single day, and there are times where they’re making their best judgments -- they’ll say, with moderate confidence, or low confidence, or high confidence, this is what we think is happening. There may be times where there are disputes internally among various intelligence agencies about that. But I don’t know the details of this. What I do know is my expectation, which is the highest fidelity to facts, data -- the truth. And if there are disagreements in terms of how folks are interpreting the facts, then that should be reflected in the reports that we receive -- that some folks think this is going on; other folks thinks that’s going on. And that’s part of what I weigh in terms of making decisions. One last thing I’ll say, though -- as a consumer of this intelligence, it’s not as if I’ve been receiving wonderfully rosy, glowing portraits of what’s been happening in Iraq and Syria over the last year and a half. So to the extent that it’s been shaded -- again, I don’t know the details of what the IG may discover -- but it feels to me like, at my level at least, we’ve had a pretty clear-eyed, sober assessment of where we’ve made real progress and where we have not. On Paris, a lot of the discussion out here both at the G20, APEC, and finally here at ASEAN, has been that we’ve got to get a strong Paris deal. And I’m optimistic that we can -- 160 countries have now put forward their national targets for how they can reduce emissions; that accounts for about 90 percent of the world’s emitters. And the key to a strong agreement is going to be that, although there’s going to be differentiation between countries -- the United States doesn't expect that our obligations are identical to Laos, for example, given our levels of development, how much carbon we emit compared to theirs -- that everybody does have a plan, that everybody is accountable to a single set of reporting requirements, that there’s transparency about what each country is doing -- that once we’ve set that architecture in place, in five years time, we can review what we’ve done, turn up the dials in light of additional information and additional technology. In some cases, we may make progress faster than we expected, and we can increase our targets. So the key is to make sure that everybody is doing their part. You raise one important issue, and that is climate finance. There are going to be a number of countries who recognize the threat of climate change, want to do something about it, but they also have large populations suffering from extreme poverty, who don't have electricity, who don't have the ability to feed their families. And any leader of those countries has to ask themselves, am I going to be sacrificing development and poverty alleviation in order to deal with climate change, particularly since a lot of more developed countries are responsible for at least the current carbon emissions that are causing climate change. And so the answer to that we’ve all agreed is a finance mechanism to help these countries adapt -- in some cases, leapfrog old technologies so that instead of building old, dirty power plants, here are some smart, clean-energy plants. And we’ll help you through technology transfer and financing so that you can achieve your development goals, but not add to the carbon problem. So far, with a target of $100 billion, we’ve reached between private and public sources $62 billion, and that target did not need to be met until 2020, based on our original commitments. So we're well on our way to meeting these commitments. And it’s a smart investment for us to make. Sometimes, back home, critics will argue, there’s no point in us doing something about getting our house in order when it comes to climate change because other countries won’t do anything and it will just mean that we're in a less competitive position. Well, when I met with President Xi and China signed on to an aggressive commitment, that took a major argument away from those critics. We now the two largest emitters signed on. And it makes sense for us and the Chinese and the Europeans and others to help these countries, because, ultimately, if a country like India, for example, with over a billion people, is a major polluter, that's going to affect all of us. If, on the other hand, they're developing and growing in a clean way, that's going to be good for all of us. I guess you want to know how the atmosphere, as a consequence of the attack in Paris would affect it. Look, I think it is absolutely vital for every country, every leader to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business, and that Paris -- one of the most beautiful, enticing cities in the world -- is not going to be cowered by the violent, demented actions of a few. And that's part of the overall message that I want to very clearly send the American people. We do not succumb to fear. That's the primary power that these terrorists have over us. They cannot strike a mortal blow against the United States, or against France, or against a country like Malaysia. But they can make people fearful. And that's understandable, because that could have been us; that could have been our families; that could have been our children in these places. And our hearts are broken when we see these images. But in addition to hunting down terrorists, in addition to effective intelligence, and in addition to missile strikes, and in addition to cutting off financing and all the other things that we're doing, the most powerful tool we have to fight ISIL is to say that we’re not afraid; to not elevate them; to somehow buy into their fantasy that they’re doing something important. They’re a bunch of killers. And there have been people throughout human history who can find an excuse to kill people because they don’t think like them or look like them. And we fight them, and we beat them, and we don’t change our institutions and our culture and our values because of them. I want to be very clear about this. I am not afraid that ISIL will beat us because of their operations. When I see a headline that says this individual who designed this plot in Paris is a mastermind -- he’s not a mastermind. He found a few other vicious people, got hands on some fairly conventional weapons, and, sadly, it turns out that if you’re willing to die, you can kill a lot of people. And so it is in our capacity to roll up those networks. Now, we got to take precautions, we have to take it seriously, and we have to go at the heart of the problem that exists inside of Syria and Iraq right now. And we have to address the broader issues that exist in a tiny fraction of the Muslim community. But it is a real problem that leaders -- from Prime Minister Najib to the President of Indonesia and others who have large Muslim populations -- acknowledge. A country like Indonesia has 250 million people; if just a tiny fraction of those are in some ways attracted by a vicious ideology like ISIL’s, then that’s a real problem for us. And so tools like countering this narrative, and Muslim clerics and political leaders and community leaders coming forward and making sure that our children are not being fed this kind of bile, that’s critically important as well. But in all of this, we cannot respond from fear. And the American people, in the past, have confronted some very real, enormous threats, and we beat them. We vanquished them. This will be no different. Kevin Corke.","Well, thank you for those questions. Let me take them one at a time.

First, on Paris, and the shadow cast by the terrible attacks that took place there a week ago. Look, our hearts go out to the people of Paris, to France, and to all those who lost loved ones in that senseless act of terror. What happened was an attack on our shared values, on freedom, on decency. And it underscores, once again, the serious threats we face in this world.

Now, will it affect the climate talks? Here's what I believe: It makes the talks *more* important, not less. When evil strikes, we don't back down. We don't hide. We stand together, we mourn, and then we redouble our efforts to build a better, more secure, and more stable world. That means working together on security, absolutely, to defeat these terrorists. But it also means working together on other global challenges, like climate change, that can impact stability and prosperity for generations. We're going to Paris to show our resolve, to show our unity, and to show that we will not let terrorists dictate our agenda or our future. We will discuss climate, and we will do so with purpose.

Second, on the substantive issue of convincing developing nations and concerns about funding, especially with some of the discussions we have back home. Let me be clear: The United States is a leader. We're a leader in innovation, we're a leader in technology, and we're a leader in helping to solve big problems. We understand that developing nations need to grow their economies, and they need reliable, affordable energy to do that. Our approach to climate is about smart solutions, not just mandates. It's about technological breakthroughs, about private sector investment, and about empowering nations to develop sustainably.

Now, when it comes to funding, yes, there are always robust discussions about how best to allocate resources. And that's a healthy part of our democratic process. But America will lead. We're going to work with our partners to find ways that make sense – ways that are fiscally responsible and effective – to help these nations transition to cleaner energy and adapt to a changing climate. It's not just about what the United States puts on the table; it's about a global effort, with every nation doing its part, and leveraging the power of innovation and the private sector. I am confident that our diplomats will make a very strong case, and we will find common ground.

Finally, on the reports this morning regarding investigations into whether intelligence officials are altering assessments of the ISIL campaign. Let me just say this: The American people, and certainly their President, rely on accurate, unvarnished intelligence. That's absolutely critical to our national security and to making good decisions. Any allegation that intelligence assessments are being manipulated or altered for political purposes, or for any other reason, is a serious matter. We take it seriously. It will be investigated thoroughly and properly. And if there are issues, they will be addressed. We have a dedicated, professional intelligence community, and we expect integrity and accuracy in their work. We need the truth, plain and simple, to win this fight against ISIL. Thank you."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about what Secretary Carter said about expanding the rules of engagement versus ISIS. What was that conversation like? And what did he mean by that? And I’d like to ask you also about immigration. The high court is looking into executive action on immigration, as you know. And I understand the sensitivity of it, you don’t want to be prejudicial. But I’m curious, are you where you thought you’d be in immigration reform? And what would you say to family members who say, listen, we did it the right way, we’ve waited our turn in line -- how do these other guys get to skip the line, if you will? And lastly, the Attorney General announced eight indictments of individuals in the U.S. and Mexico on sex trafficking and related charges. Where is the fight against sex trafficking among the priorities for your Administration? Are you where you thought you’d be on that? Thank you, sir. ","Okay. Kevin, you asked all those questions so nicely, but if everybody is asking three questions, we’re not going to get home. So let me see if I can go through these very quickly. With respect to rules of engagement, we are in a constant conversation inside the Situation Room about how do we apply force most effectively to go after key ISIL targets, key ISIL leaders, strategic positions, their infrastructure, their supply lines, while minimizing civilian casualties. We do so for two reasons: One, because it’s the right thing to do. There are people who are caught up in Mosul right now, for example, who despise ISIL, who are essentially captive to ISIL, are being brutalized by ISIL. And to the extent that we can avoid them being killed by those of us who are trying to defeat ISIL, that’s a legitimate concern in any military campaign. Because if we’re not careful about it -- and this brings us to the practical element of it -- then you can alienate the very populations that you need to win over, because ultimately those are the folks who are going to have to drive ISIL out, stomp it out all the way. The good news is, is the U.S. military has become very good at this. I think that there have been some circumstances where the military proceeds in steps and are continually reevaluating whether, well, maybe this is a situation where we can, in fact, take the strike without a lot of civilian casualties. A good example with the recent trucks that were struck. There may be ways in which warnings can be given to the drivers -- many of whom may not work for ISIL, they may just be for hire or being forced into it -- so that they better abandon those trucks before we shoot them down, because we’re shooting them down. So that’s the kind of conversation, and that’s been ongoing throughout the process. With respect to immigration reform, I can’t comment on the ins and outs of the legal case. I’ve said before and I’ll say again, I am confident that the rules and executive action that I put forward are squarely within the category of prosecutorial discretion that historically has been under a President’s power. And you’ve got lower courts who’ve disagreed, but we think that past precedent is on our side. Substantively, I’ve got 11 million people in our countries, many of whom are working, paying taxes, our neighbors, coworkers, friends who’ve lived in the United States for a very long time. We’re not going to deport them, despite what some political leaders may say. It would be contrary to who we are, would be too costly, is too impractical. What we want to do is allow them to get out of the shadows and to get right with the law, pay a fine, go to the back of the line, but hopefully, over time, be contributors to society. Of course, none of this would be necessary if we just passed the legislation that was passed in the Senate with a bipartisan majority. And I continue to believe that the ultimate solution is going to be one that comes from Congress. And although, during this political season, it may be difficult for Republican leaders in either the House or in the Senate to resuscitate that legislation, my hope is, is that after the election, they will. And in the interim, I’m going to do everything I can to sensibly apply our immigration laws in a way that is reflective of the fact that we're a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And just very briefly, with respect to sex trafficking -- this is a critical problem. We take it very seriously. We have entire divisions in our law enforcement agencies that are dedicated to this. I’ve elevated this within the White House so that we have people focusing specifically on ending trafficking. And in our international discussions -- most specifically, out here in Southeast Asia -- we are working very closely to promote mechanisms that will end trafficking. In fact, TPP, one of the central mechanisms in TPP, to ensure high labor standards and human rights and human dignity, are requirements among the members who are signatories to have in place real, serious, enforceable ways to prevent the kind of human trafficking that causes such hardship and brutality for so many people. And those of you who were with me when I visited the refugee center yesterday will recall the lovely young 16-year-old who was sitting next to me -- she’s somebody who had been a victim of trafficking. And it reminds you of the terrible toll that is often placed on children, people who are the most vulnerable, people who are least able to protect themselves. And every country has an obligation to put an end to it. David Nakamura. 0","Well, thank you for those important questions. Let me take them one by one.

First, on Secretary Carter and our efforts against ISIS – and let me be clear, this administration is absolutely committed to the total destruction of ISIS, and we are making progress. When we talk about expanding the rules of engagement, what we're really talking about is empowering our commanders on the ground. The conversation, as you can imagine, is a serious one, focused on strategy, on protecting our troops, and on eliminating this barbaric terrorist organization that threatens not just the Middle East, but our own security at home.

What Secretary Carter meant, and what we've discussed, is ensuring that our military has every tool, every bit of flexibility they need, to take the fight directly to the enemy. It's about cutting through red tape, making sure our pilots and our special forces can act decisively, hit targets effectively, and without unnecessary delays. We are not going to fight this enemy with one hand tied behind our back. We are giving our brave men and women the authority to act swiftly and decisively to destroy ISIS wherever they may try to hide. We're talking about smart, aggressive, and effective military action to protect America and our allies.

Now, on immigration. You're right, the high court is looking at executive action, and we respect the judicial process. That's how our system works. But let me be clear: my administration is absolutely committed to securing our borders, enforcing our laws, and fixing a broken immigration system. Are we exactly where I thought we'd be on reform? Look, this is one of the toughest issues facing our nation, and frankly, Congress has struggled with it for decades. It's complex, it's emotional, and it requires real leadership and compromise that has, quite frankly, been in short supply.

But here’s what I can tell the families who did it the right way, who waited their turn in line: I hear you. We understand your frustration, and we share it. The rule of law is fundamental to who we are as a nation. There is a legal process for immigration, and it must be respected. We are working every single day to enforce our laws, to secure our borders, and to ensure that we have an immigration system that is orderly, fair, and puts the interests of American citizens and those who follow the rules first. We cannot have a system where people believe they can just bypass the legal process. That undermines the very fabric of our society and is unfair to everyone who plays by the rules. We need comprehensive reform, and we need Congress to act, but until then, we will do everything in our power to enforce the laws as they stand and to improve the integrity of our system.

Finally, on the Attorney General’s announcement regarding sex trafficking. Let me tell you, this is not just a priority for my administration, it's a moral imperative. The fight against sex trafficking, against modern-day slavery, is at the absolute top of our law enforcement agenda. These are heinous crimes, preying on the most vulnerable among us – our children, our young people. It is evil, plain and simple.

Are we where I thought we'd be? We're making tremendous progress, and these indictments are a testament to the tireless work of our law enforcement agencies, both domestically and internationally. We're bringing these criminals to justice, we're dismantling these networks, and we're rescuing victims. But let me also say, this fight is never over as long as a single child, a single individual, is trapped in this horrific trade. We will continue to dedicate resources, to work with our partners around the globe, and to pursue these perpetrators with the full force of American justice. We must protect the innocent, and we will. It is a fundamental responsibility of a civilized society, and my administration takes it very, very seriously.

Thank you."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You said moments ago that Americans should not give in to fear when it comes to these terrorist attacks. But you also said that the person who may have been the person behind thinking about the attacks is not a mastermind and that anybody who can get their hands on some conventional weapons can -- and is willing to die can blow themselves up. How should Americans feel that if they shouldn’t be scared? And if I may, The Washington Post and ABC News just this week came out with a poll that said 83 percent of the voting public believes that an attack, a terrorist attack against the U.S. with mass casualties is likely to happen in the near future, and 40 percent say it’s very likely. Does that in your mind -- given the fact that you think the public should not be so fearful -- mean that the terrorists are winning? And do you believe that this is sort of the new normal, and Americans will have to live with this kind of fear? ","David, I think that the American people are right to be concerned, and to expect that we in the government and in law enforcement are doing everything we can to disrupt terrorist attacks, to intercept intelligence that may lead us to individuals who are willing to carry out these attacks, that we make sure that these terrorists are not gaining the kinds of weaponry that would make it easier for them to cause mass attacks. This is a serious problem. And as somebody who more often than I would like has met with or comforted families of victims of terrorism, the losses are real and they're devastating. So this is a serious problem. And we have to work collectively across the board, as we’ve been doing since I became President and since previous administrations identified the kinds of organized terrorist activity like al Qaeda that we’ve seen -- we’ve got to do everything we can to stop it. But there is a difference between being vigilant and being concerned and taking this seriously and taking precautions and, in some cases, changing our security arrangements, as we’ve done, for example, in aviation -- there’s a difference between smart applications of law enforcement and military and intelligence, and succumbing to the kind of fear that leads us to abandon our values, to abandon how we live, to abandon -- or change how we treat each other. And the good news is, there, Americans actually have been resilient. They’ve been tested. We had a mass casualty attack on 9/11. And as I said before, I was very proud of the fact that the fundamental nature of America and how we treated each other did not change. I think we made some bad decisions subsequent to that attack in part based on fear, and that's why we have to be cautious about it. We have to think things through. But overall, the American people went about their lives. Times Square is filled with people -- rightly so. After the Boston bombing attack, folks went right back to the ballpark and sang, “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.” That's what they needed to do. And so the message I have is that those of us who are charged with protecting the American people are going to do everything we can to destroy this particular network. 1 Once this network is destroyed -- and it will be -- there may be others that pop up in different parts of the world, and so we're going to have to continue to take seriously how we maintain the infrastructure that we’ve built to prevent this. But it doesn't have to change the fundamental trajectory of the American people. And that we should feel confident about. And the media needs to help in this. I just want to say -- during the course of this week, a very difficult week, it is understandable that this has been a primary focus. But one of the things that has to happen is how we report on this has to maintain perspective, and not empower in any way these terrorist organizations or elevate them in ways that make it easier for them to recruit or make them stronger. They're a bunch of killers with good social media. And they are dangerous, and they’ve caused great hardship to people. But the overwhelming majority of people who go about their business every day, the Americans who are building things, and making things, and teaching, and saving lives as firefighters and as police officers -- they're stronger. Our way of life is stronger. We have more to offer -- we represent 99.9 percent of humanity. And that's why we should be confident that we’ll win. Colleen McCain Nelson.","Thank you for that question, and it's an important one, because it gets right to the heart of what these terrorists want to achieve.

Let me be clear. When I say Americans should not give in to fear, I'm not saying we should be naïve or ignore the very real threats we face. I understand completely why the American people are concerned – and that poll you cite, it reflects a legitimate worry. We live in a dangerous world, and yes, it is a sad truth that a determined individual, filled with hatred, can acquire conventional weapons and attempt to cause great harm. That's why our intelligence agencies, our law enforcement, our military are working tirelessly, around the clock, to stop them.

But here's the difference, and this is crucial: *Vigilance* is not *fear*. Being aware of the threat, being prepared, supporting our first responders – that's being a responsible citizen. Giving in to panic, letting these cowards change our way of life, abandoning our freedoms, staying home and letting our economy falter because we're scared to step outside – *that* is giving in to fear. That is exactly what these terrorists want.

So, are the terrorists winning? Absolutely not. Make no mistake. Terrorists win when they break our spirit. They win when they sow division and distrust. They win when we let them dictate how we live our lives. We have not, and we will not, let that happen. Our nation is stronger than any group of thugs and killers. Our resolve is deeper. Our values are enduring.

Is this the new normal? We face a new reality of persistent threats, yes. But the ""normal"" for America has always been resilience, courage, and freedom. We adapt, we overcome, and we continue to live our lives, worship our God, raise our children, and pursue our dreams. We will hunt down these terrorists, we will dismantle their networks, and we will protect the homeland. And we will do it all without sacrificing the very liberties they despise. We will not live in fear. We will live free. Thank you."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You've threatened to veto the bill the House passed that would tighten screening procedures for Syrian refugees, but you've left the door open to legislation that is more constructive in the White House’s view. ",Yes.,"Well, thank you for that. Look, when it comes to the safety and security of the American people, there is no room for error. We take this responsibility very, very seriously. And while I appreciate the concerns of members of the House, and I truly do, the bill they passed... it simply wasn't the right approach. It wasn't effective. It didn't strengthen our security; it just made it more difficult for people who've gone through unimaginable hardship to find safety, without actually making us any safer.

What we need is smart legislation. Legislation that is tough, that is robust, that ensures we know exactly who is coming into our country. And believe me, our intelligence agencies, our security professionals, they are working tirelessly, and we have the best people in the world. We need to empower them, not put in place measures that are more about political posturing than real protection.

America is a compassionate nation. We've always been a beacon of hope for people fleeing tyranny and terror. And we can uphold that legacy while also making absolutely certain that our homeland is secure. It's not an either/or proposition. We can do both. And I am absolutely committed to working with Congress to find that common ground, to pass a bill that reflects both our values and our absolute determination to keep our country safe. That's what the American people expect, and that's what they deserve."
" What specific changes to your refugee program would you support? And do you think that Democrats who are calling for a halt to your program are betraying our country’s values, as you've suggested of some Republicans? And one last thing -- I’m sorry -- separately. Not a four-part question. ","Just a two-parter. Okay, go ahead.","Alright, let's talk about it. Look, we have a country, and we have to protect our country. Nobody understands that better than me.

So, when we talk about the refugee program, the *biggest* changes, the *most important* changes, are about **extreme vetting**. And I mean extreme. We're talking about making sure we know *exactly* who is coming into our country. Not just who they say they are, but their background, their history, their intentions. We can't afford to take chances, folks. We just can't. Other countries, frankly, they don't do it right, and we end up with problems. We need to be the smartest, the toughest.

And frankly, we need to make sure we're not being taken advantage of. We're a generous nation, the most generous, but we also have to put *America First*. That means looking at the numbers, making sure they're sustainable, and prioritizing those who genuinely need help and can truly contribute, not just opening the floodgates. We also need to get other countries, wealthy countries, to pay their fair share, because right now, we're carrying too much of the load. It's not fair.

Now, as for Democrats calling for a halt to a program – if it's a program that's *protecting* our country, that's *keeping us safe*, then yes, absolutely. When people push policies that weaken our borders, that make us less secure, that don't put the safety of American citizens at the very top, then they are absolutely undermining the fundamental values of our nation. Our first duty as leaders is to protect our citizens. Period.

It's not about partisanship; it's about common sense. When you're advocating for things that make us vulnerable, you're not putting America first, and that's a problem. A big problem. We have to be strong. Very, very strong. Believe me."
" Thank you. This is a question for both of you. First, what is your reaction to Turkey shooting down a Russian plane today? And does this draw NATO into a confrontation with Russia? How do you keep this from spiraling out of control? And, President Obama, what does this incident mean for future prospects of military coordination -- more military coordination with Russia? And, President Hollande, ahead of your trip to Moscow on Thursday, what are the prospects for closer military coordination with Russia, given what happened today? ","Well, first of all, we’re still getting the details of what happened. And I expect to be in communications, potentially directly, with President Erdogan sometime over the next several days. Turkey, like every country, has a right to defend its territory and its airspace. I think it’s very important right now for us to make sure that both the Russians and the Turks are talking to each other to find out exactly what happened, and take measures to discourage any kind of escalation. I do think that this points to a ongoing problem with the Russian operations in the sense that they are operating very close to a Turkish border, and they are going after a moderate opposition that are supported by not only Turkey but a wide range of countries. And if Russia is directing its energies towards Daesh and ISIL, some of those conflicts, or potentials for mistakes or escalation, are less likely to occur. I also think this underscores the importance of us making sure that we move this political track forward as quickly as possible. Like President Hollande, our view from the start has been that Russia is welcome to be part of this broad-based coalition that we’ve set up. There’s never been a point in time in which we said that we don’t want Russia or other countries that may have differences with us on a whole host of other things to avoid working with us against ISIL. The challenge has been Russia’s focus on propping up Assad rather than focusing on ISIL. I had a conversation with President Putin in Turkey, and I indicated to him at the time that to the extent that they make that strategic shift -- focus on the Vienna process, where they have been constructive, to try to bring all the parties together; try to execute a political transition that all parties would agree to; and refocus attention on going after ISIL -- then there’s enormous capacity for us to cooperate. Until that happens, it’s very difficult. It’s difficult because if their priority is attacking the moderate opposition that might be future members of an inclusive Syrian government, Russia is not going to get the support of us or a range of other members of the coalition. But I do think that there is the possibility of cooperation. The sooner we agree to this political process, the less likely that you have the kinds of events that took place, apparently, today. President Hollande: [As interpreted.] The event that took place is a serious one, and we can only regret it. Turkey is currently providing all of the information to NATO so that we can find out what truly happened and whether Turkey’s airspace indeed was entered into. But we must prevent an escalation; that would be extremely damageable. The only purpose is to fight against terrorism and Daesh. This is what we must do, all of us -- we, Turkey, Russia. And what just took place, like Barack said, means that we must find a solution to the Syrian crisis, because we can see what the risks are otherwise -- the risks of escalation. I, therefore, will be traveling to Russia this week because we have this resolution of the Security Council and it does show that we must take action against Daesh, against terrorism. That resolution has been voted unanimously. In a way, that was the broadest possible coalition. Then, I will ask President Putin, as I’ve done before and what I told the Russians a number of times already, that the strikes must be against Daesh, against terrorism, and those who precisely are threatening us. They are threatening the Russians, like ourselves in Europe, like France that was targeted over the past few days. We must, therefore, coordinate ourselves, cooperate, but on that basis, and make sure that we’re all acting against Daesh. And that will be part of the political process, one that must lead to the solution. And we all know what the parameters of the solution are or are not. We know that there’s a deadlock today. Lastly, I mentioned the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, which is in the east of the Mediterranean now. As a matter of fact, there are also some Russian forces. And I, therefore, agreed with President Putin that we must share our intelligence so that we can act in coordination. We must not contradict ourselves. And it’s already the case, and we’ll continue to do so.","Well, this is a serious situation, folks, no two ways about it. When you have a NATO ally, a sovereign nation like Turkey, defending its airspace and shooting down a Russian plane, it's a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the region.

My initial reaction is to stand firmly with our NATO ally, Turkey. Every nation has a right to defend its borders and its airspace. We need to get all the facts straight, but make no mistake, Turkey is a vital partner, and our commitment to their security is unwavering.

Now, does this draw NATO into a confrontation with Russia? Look, NATO is a defensive alliance. Our commitment to Article 5 is ironclad, but that's about collective defense if an ally is attacked. This incident, while grave, needs to be handled with extreme care and diplomacy, not rhetoric that inflames tensions. We're not looking for a confrontation with Russia, and frankly, Russia shouldn't be looking for one either.

How do you keep this from spiraling out of control? You do it through direct, unambiguous communication. You pick up the phone. You make sure all parties understand the very real dangers of miscalculation. You de-escalate. You focus everyone's attention on the shared enemy—and that's radical Islamic terrorism, that's ISIS. We can't let this kind of incident distract us from the vital mission of destroying these terrorists. Russia needs to be part of that solution, not part of the problem.

As for military coordination with Russia—well, let me tell you, incidents like this don't make it any easier. Any prospect for closer military coordination with Russia has always hinged on Russia acting responsibly, respecting international law, and focusing its efforts on fighting ISIS, not supporting the Assad regime or targeting moderate opposition forces. When you have a situation where a Russian plane is shot down by a NATO ally, it complicates everything. The path to effective coordination has to be built on trust and clear intentions, and right now, trust is a very precious commodity. We've always been willing to work with anyone who's serious about fighting terrorism, but they've got to be serious about it in a way that doesn't put our allies or our interests at risk."
" [As interpreted.] Mr. President, the Americans have some Special Forces in Syria. Beyond the words and beyond what is happening, are you going to send some Special Forces as well to Syria? Are you considering some ground intervention there? Mr. President, beyond the emotion that we can feel here, beyond these beautiful statements, for more than a year we heard all of you saying that Assad must go, that a political transition is necessary in Syria. Mr. President, can you today, here, in front of us, tell us a specific date, a deadline for Assad to go? ",Who is this addressed to? Me or for him?,"Well, thank you for those questions. Let me be clear on several points here.

First, regarding our Special Forces in Syria: Our brave men and women in uniform are there with a clear mission. They are advising, assisting, and training local forces who are fighting brutal terrorists and working to create stability in a very dangerous region. This is about protecting America's national security interests, and about supporting those on the ground who are willing to fight for their own future against common enemies. We are constantly evaluating the situation, and we will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the safety of our personnel and the success of their mission. But I'm not going to telegraph our operational plans or speculate about future deployments from this podium. That would be irresponsible and undermine the very people we're trying to protect. Ground intervention, as you call it, is a broad term, and we are always looking at the most effective ways to achieve our objectives without putting our troops at undue risk.

Second, on the matter of Bashar al-Assad and a specific deadline for his departure: Let me reiterate what we have consistently stated: Assad has lost all legitimacy to govern. He has brutalized his own people and created an environment of instability that fuels extremism. A political transition, one that reflects the will of the Syrian people, is absolutely essential for a stable and peaceful Syria. Now, you ask for a specific date, a deadline. This isn't a simple calendar event. This is a complex, geopolitical challenge that requires sustained diplomatic pressure, economic leverage, and the coordinated efforts of our international partners. Setting an arbitrary deadline publicly isn't strategy; it's often counterproductive. It can embolden our adversaries, weaken our diplomatic hand, and doesn't account for the unpredictable realities on the ground. Our focus is on achieving the *outcome* – a Syria free from Assad's tyranny, a Syria where its people can live in peace and dignity. We will continue to work tirelessly towards that outcome, and we will do so strategically, not by setting artificial timelines that serve no real purpose beyond a soundbite. This is about what's right for the Syrian people and what's right for long-term regional stability, and we're committed to seeing it through."
" I can translate in English, if needed. ","No, no, I had the translation. You said “President,” and we’ve got two Presidents here. President Hollande: [As interpreted.] I will not provide you with a date because it must be as soon as possible. That is one of the requirements for a solution to be found. But at the same time, allow me to underline something. There is a new mindset now. The crisis in Syria has been ongoing for four years -- four years. There are probably more than 300,000 dead. And this is not just relevant to the countries of the region, which are hosting the refugees. It is relevant to Europe and the entire world now with that issue of refugees. And those who believe that we could wait some more, and that, in any case, it was far away, they now realize that we have an influx of refugees, that the terrorists -- the risk is everywhere due to Daesh. We, therefore, must act. You also asked me what we were going to do, what more. We will intensify the strikes. We will have some more specific target to make sure that Daesh resources, their means are cut off, including their command centers, the trucks carrying oil, their training centers where they prepare terror attacks. We will continue and we will intensify our strikes at the heart of the cities which are currently in the hands of Daesh. France will not intervene militarily on the ground. It is for the local forces to do so. We've been supporting them for a number of months. We will continue to do so. And they will do the job on the ground after our strikes that will enable them to do so. But France will take its responsibilities regarding that support, which is absolutely necessary.","Well, that's mighty thoughtful of you to offer. We here believe in crystal clear communication, folks, and it's always good to know we've got folks like you ready to make sure everyone's on the same page. We appreciate that commitment to understanding. Thank you."
" Thank you, Mr. President. [Speaks French.] Mr. President, could you tell us whether the Russian plane did, in fact, breach Turkish airspace? And given the fury of the Russian response on economic, diplomatic, and rhetorical fronts, how concerned are you that there might also be a military component, if not in Turkey, then perhaps with expanded action against coalition interests inside Syria? [As interpreted.] And, Mr. President, regarding the measures announced today when it comes to strengthening the cooperation on military intelligence and all this, had they been taken a month or weeks ago, do you think they would have prevented the terror attacks that took place in Paris, or will enable us to prevent some further terror attacks? ","We don't have all the information yet, so I don't want to comment on the specifics. We will be gathering all that information. We expect the Turks to provide information. I'm sure the Russians will have some information. And we'll be able to confirm what happened in part through our own intelligence and our own tracking of that border area. 1 As François indicated, my top priority is going to be to ensure that this does not escalate. And hopefully, this is a moment in which all parties can step back and make a determination as to how their interests are best served. The Russians had several hundred people of their own killed by ISIL. And the flow of foreign fighters out of Russian areas into Syria poses an enormous, long-term threat to Russian territory. So there is a potential convergence of interests between the various parties. It requires us working with them to make the kind of strategic shift that’s necessary and that, frankly, I’ve talked to Putin about for five years now. It requires a recognition that the existing structure cannot gain the legitimacy to stop the war, and until you stop the war, you’re going to have a vacuum in which these kinds of terrorist organizations can operate more effectively. Let me say one last thing, because I’ve tracked the question that you posed to President Hollande about what could or could not have been prevented. All of our intelligence personnel here in the United States, across the Atlantic, work tirelessly, as I said earlier, to disrupt plots and prevent terrorists attacks. The vast majority of their successes in disrupting plots are not advertised. You never hear about them. But were it not for the dedication of those intelligence and law enforcement and military professionals, this would be a much more dangerous world. So you have to be careful about speculating about “what if” and “could have” and “would have” in a situation like this -- because it’s hard. You have eight individuals with light weapons; that’s a hard thing to track. What is true, though, is that we can do a better job of coordinating between countries. And I’ve been talking to our European partners for quite some time now about the need for better intelligence, sharing passenger name records, working to ensure that when people enter into Europe -- particularly now -- that the information across various borders is shared on a timely basis, and you have biometric information and other technologies that can make it more accurate. It doesn’t mean it’s always going to be 100 percent foolproof, but we can do better on those fronts. And one of the challenges has been, frankly, in the past several years, that you have different legal traditions, concerns about privacy and civil liberties, all of which are entirely legitimate. I don’t think those can be ignored now, because that’s part of the -- those are part of the values that make us who we are and that we have to adhere to. But I do think that this is a reminder that this is a dangerous world. And rooting out small bands of terrorist groups who maintain good operational security and are using modern technologies in ways that are hard to track, that that’s a tough job. And we’re all going to have to pool our resources much more effectively together than we have in the past. And I think when François goes back to Europe, his leadership, the leadership of other presidents and prime ministers around this issue is going to be as important as anything that we do. 2 President Hollande: [As interpreted.] Allow me to go back to what Daesh truly is. It is somehow an organization, a terrorist group occupying a territory in Iraq and Syria, killing. And they want to install rules that dishonor humanity. This is what Daesh is doing there. And this is what they are trying to do in other countries, everywhere [inaudible] stands. And then we have to deal with the number of networks more or less organized in a number of countries that are being used to lead terror attacks, like was the case precisely in Paris. We know that this dreadful plan was prepared in Syria, and then organized in a number of countries. And there are also some accomplices in France, given that some of the terrorists are French, those who committed these acts of war. So if we want to tackle terrorism, we must act not only to destroy Daesh where they are -- in Syria, in Iraq -- but we must also dismantle and destroy these networks. How can we proceed? Well, first of all, militarily, by intensifying our strikes, by taking back these territories, thanks to the local forces on the ground, which we can support by finding a political solution in Syria, by making sure that the territorial integrity of Iraq is restored. This is what we can do. Then, when it comes to protection measures to protect our territory and our people, this is what I announced in France and this is what we have to do to eradicate these networks and all of these accomplices and those who are present. Some of them just arrived; others have been there for a long time, and they are not necessarily identified as a threat. It is, therefore, necessary that we strengthen yet further our cooperation in terms of intelligence. The Paris attacks generated a lot of emotion. But that’s not enough -- compassion, solidarity. And I take note of it, but we must act. And for a number of days now, I’ve been trying to convince -- convincing all the countries that can act to do so. I met with David Cameron yesterday. He announced that he would take a number of measures to his parliament. That is important. Today I’m here with Barack so that we can act with greater intensity and coherence, as well. Tomorrow I will be hosting German Chancellor Angela Merkel so that European countries, including Germany, can face up to their responsibilities, including in terms of military intelligence and police cooperation, and maybe more. I will also travel to Moscow, so that Russia acts -- can take action against Daesh, and only against Daesh. And then I will receive Matteo Renzi, the head of the Italian government. I will also have an opportunity to talk to all of the European leaders, given that a European Council, together with Turkey, will be held on Sunday. So it is all of that that must get together and enable us to implement coordination, cooperation in our actions so that we can act on the source, Daesh, and networks that it can use. It is that strength that will enable us to succeed. 3","Well, thank you very much for those important questions. Let me address them head-on.

First, regarding the Russian plane and Turkish airspace: Look, our intelligence, and the assessments coming from NATO, are quite clear. Turkey has presented compelling evidence, and our information supports the view that their airspace was indeed breached. Turkey is a sovereign nation, a vital NATO ally, and every nation has the right to defend its borders. This was a serious incident, and we've been very clear with Moscow that they need to de-escalate and take all necessary steps to prevent such incidents from happening again.

Now, on the concern about a military component and further Russian action: We are, of course, always concerned about anything that could further destabilize the region or lead to unintended consequences. We’ve urged Russia to focus its military efforts on defeating ISIS, which is the common enemy we all face. Instead, much of what we've seen has been about propping up the Assad regime. Any action that targets coalition interests, or that further complicates our efforts against ISIS, is deeply concerning. We are in constant communication with our allies, including Turkey, to ensure the safety and security of our personnel and our operations in the region. We're watching the situation very closely, and we will continue to stand with our allies.

And on your second question, about the measures announced today and whether they would have prevented the horrific attacks in Paris: My friend, that’s a painful hypothetical, and one that's impossible to answer with certainty. Hindsight is always 20/20. What I can tell you is this: the strengthening of military intelligence cooperation, the enhanced sharing of information—these are absolutely critical steps. We are fighting an evolving, adaptive enemy, and we have to be even more adaptive, more unified, and more agile. Every piece of intelligence shared, every joint effort to disrupt terrorist plots, makes us safer. These attacks in Paris were a barbaric assault on all civilized people, and while no single measure can ever guarantee 100% prevention, these steps we’re taking today are vital to our collective security, and they will absolutely help us prevent future attacks. We must and we will continue to do everything in our power to protect our citizens and our allies."
" Good morning, sir, and thank you, Mr. President. For months now, you’ve been asking Mr. Putin to play basically a more constructive role in Syria, basically shifting from defending Assad to attacking ISIL. It appears your calls have not been heard. What’s your strategy going forward? ","Well, I'm not sure that's true. The fact that the Vienna process is moving forward, steadily -- not conclusively, but steadily -- I think is an indication that Mr. Putin recognizes there is not going to be a military resolution to the situation in Syria. The Russians now have been there for several weeks, over a month, and I think fair-minded reporters who looked at the situation would say that the situation hasn’t changed significantly. In the interim, Russia has lost a commercial passenger jet. You’ve seen another jet shot down. There have been losses in terms of Russian personnel. And I think Mr. Putin understands that, with Afghanistan fresh in the memory, for him to simply get bogged down in a inconclusive and paralyzing civil conflict is not the outcome that he’s looking for. Now, where we continue to have an ongoing difference is not on the need for a political settlement; it's the issue of whether Mr. Assad can continue to serve as President while still bringing the civil war to an end. It's been my estimation for five years now that that's not possible. Regardless of how you feel about Mr. Assad -- and I consider somebody who kills hundreds of thousands of his own people illegitimate -- but regardless of the moral equation, as a practical matter, it is impossible for Mr. Assad to bring that country together and to bring all the parties into an inclusive government. It is possible, however, to preserve the Syrian state, to have an inclusive government in which the interests of the various groups inside of Syria are represented. And so, as part of the Vienna process, you're going to see the opposition groups -- the moderate opposition groups that exist within Syria -- some of which, frankly, we don't have a lot in common with but do represent significant factions inside of Syria -- they’ll be coming together in order for them to form at least a negotiating unit or process that can move Vienna forward. And we're going to just keep on working at this. And my hope and expectation is, is that political track will move at the same time as we continue to apply greater and greater pressure on ISIL. And with the contributions that the French have made, the Germans have recently announced additional resources to the fight, the Brits have been steady partners in Iraq and I think are now very interested in how they can expand their efforts to help deal with ISIL inside of Syria -- with not just the cohesion of the coalition the United States put together but also the increasing intensity of our actions in the air and progressively on the ground, I think it is possible over the next several months that we both see a shift in calculation in the Russians and a recognition that it's time to bring the civil war in Syria to a close. It's not going to be easy. Too much blood has been shed, too much infrastructure has been destroyed, too many people have been displaced, for us to anticipate that it will be a smooth transition. And ISIL is going to continue to be a deadly organization -- because of its social media, the resources that it has and the networks of experienced fighters that it possesses -- is going to continue to be a serious threat for some time to come. But I’m confident that we are on the winning side of this and that, ultimately, Russia is going to recognize the threat that ISIL poses to its country, to its people, is the most significant, and that they need to align themselves with those of us who are fighting ISIL. Justin Sink.","Good morning. Thank you for that important question.

Let me be absolutely clear: our position on Syria has been consistent, it has been persistent, and it has been unambiguous. The gravest threat emerging from that region is ISIS – a radical, barbaric group that murders innocent men, women, and children and seeks to export its hateful ideology across the globe. These are not merely terrorists; they are an evil that must be confronted and destroyed.

We have asked Russia to focus its efforts on this clear and present danger. We've asked them to join the civilized world in defeating ISIS. Unfortunately, what we have seen is a continued effort to prop up the Assad regime. And let's not forget, that is a regime that has brutalized its own people, a regime that has used chemical weapons, and a regime whose very existence fuels the extremism we are trying to fight.

So, what is our strategy going forward? Our strategy remains steadfast. We will continue to build and strengthen a strong international coalition committed to freedom and security. We will continue to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIS, because we understand that if we do not defeat them there, they will come here. We will continue to support those within Syria who are fighting for a future free from tyranny, whether that tyranny comes from a dictator like Assad or from the terrorists of ISIS.

We will not waver in our resolve. We expect nations to stand with us against terror, not to stand in its way by propping up regimes that create the very conditions for terror to flourish. America leads, and we will lead with principle, ensuring the safety of our people and promoting freedom around the world. We will do what is necessary."
" Thanks, Mr. President. I guess I wanted to follow on that shift in calculation that you discussed in terms of President Putin. Did you receive assurances from either him or President Hollande -- who said earlier this week that President Putin had told him he would only target jihadis and ISIS -- that that will be the focus of Russia’s military campaign going forward? And then, separately, I just wanted to ask about climate. The outstanding issue seems to be whether Republicans who have kind of voiced opposition to your agenda could somehow submarine funding for the Green Climate Fund. That’s a pretty crucial part here. So I’m wondering both how you prevent that in the upcoming appropriations process, and if you’re at all concerned about what Senator McConnell said earlier today or yesterday that a future Republican President could undo what you’re trying to accomplish here in Paris. ","First of all, on Mr. Putin, I don’t expect that you’re going to see a 180- turn on their strategy over the next several weeks. They have invested for years now in keeping Assad in power. Their presence there is predicated on propping him up. And so that’s going to take some time for them to change how they think about the issue. And so long as they are aligned with the regime, a lot of Russian resources are still going to be targeted at opposition groups that ultimately are going to end up being part of an inclusive government that we support or other members of the coalition support, and are fighting the regime and fighting ISIL at the same time. So I don’t think we should be under any illusions that somehow Russia starts hitting only ISIL targets. That’s not happening now. It was never happening. It’s not going to be happening in the next several weeks. What can happen is if the political process that John Kerry has so meticulously stitched together -- in concert with Foreign Minister Lavrov of Russia -- if that works in Vienna, then it’s possible, given the existing accord that the parties have already agreed to, that we start seeing at least pockets of ceasefires in and around Syria. That may mean then that certain opposition groups no longer find themselves subject to either Syrian or Russian bombing; they are then in a conversation about politics. And slowly, we then are able to get everybody’s attention diverted to where it needs to be, and that is going after ISIL in a systematic way. With respect to climate and what’s taking place here, I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves -- we still need a Paris agreement. And so my main focus is making sure that the United States is a leader in bringing a successful agreement home here in Paris. And there are a number of components to it. So I just want to repeat so that everybody understands what we will consider success several weeks from now. Number one, that it is an ambitious target that seeks a low-carbon global economy over the course of this century. That means that countries have put forward specific targets, and although those are self-generating, there is a mechanism in which they are presenting to the world confirmation that they are working on those targets, meeting on those targets. So there’s a single transparency mechanism that all countries are adhering to, and that those are legally binding; that there’s periodic reviews so that as the science changes and as technology changes, five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now -- in each successive cycle, countries can update the pledges that they make; and that we’ve got a climate fund that helps developing countries to not only adapt and mitigate but also leapfrog over dirty- power generation in favor of clean energy. And if we hit those targets, then we will have been successful. Not because, by the way, the pledges alone will meet the necessary targets for us to prevent catastrophic climate change, but because we will have built the architecture that’s needed. We will have established a global consensus of how we’re going to approach the problem. And then we can successfully turn up the dials as new sources of energy become available, as the unit costs for something like solar or improvements in battery technology make it easier for us to meet even higher targets. And systematically, we can drive down carbon emissions and the pace of climate change over the course of several decades. So I want to emphasize this because I know that in some of the reporting -- if you add up all the pledges and they were all met right now, we would be at a estimated 2.7 centigrade increase in temperature. That’s too high. We wanted to get 2 centigrade or even lower than that. But if we have these periodic reviews built in, what I believe will happen is that by sending that signal to researchers and scientists and investors and entrepreneurs and venture funds, we’ll actually start hitting these targets faster than we expected, and we can be even more ambitious. And so when you look at the cumulative targets that may exist 10 years from now, we may well be within the 2 percent centigrade increase. And by the way, that’s not just foolish optimism. When you look at the experience of the United States, for example -- I came into office, I prioritized clean energy, I said we’re going to double our clean energy production. Through the Recovery Act, we recognized that making these big investments were also good for the economy and helping us get out of recession and could create jobs. So we made a big investment, and it turned out that we met our goals a lot quicker than we expected. If you had asked me when I first came into office my expectations for the price of solar- generated power versus traditional coal or other fossil-fuel-generated power, I would say we would make some progress but that solar would still require substantial subsidies in order to be economical. The cost of solar has gone down much faster than any of us would have predicted even five years ago. So the key here is to set up the structure so that we’re sending signals all around the world: This is happening. We’re not turning back. And the thing about human ingenuity -- I was going to say American ingenuity, but there are other smart folks around too, don’t want to be too parochial about this -- the thing about human ingenuity is, is that it responds when it gets a strong signal of what needs to be done. The old expression that necessity is the mother of invention -- well, this is necessary. And us getting a strong, high-ambition agreement in place, even if it doesn’t meet all the goals that we ultimately need to meet, sends a signal that it’s necessary and that will spur on the innovation that’s going to ultimately meet our goals. Nancy Benac.","Well, thank you for the question. It's an important one, and I appreciate you bringin' it up.

Now, on President Putin, look, we hear what he says. And we hear what President Hollande says he's heard from President Putin. Our focus, and it's been clear from day one, is on defeating ISIS. Plain and simple. They are a grave threat to our security, to our allies, and to people who love freedom around the world. We've made it clear to Russia, and to everyone else, that any effort in Syria needs to be aimed squarely at these terrorists. We've got to make sure that any action helps stabilize the region, not destabilize it further, and that it works towards a genuine political transition that allows the Syrian people to build a better future. We'll continue to engage with all partners, because this is a big challenge, and America leads in these situations. But our eyes are wide open when it comes to what folks say and what folks do.

Now, on climate, and the Green Climate Fund, and what my friend Senator McConnell said. Here's the deal: My administration is committed to being good stewards of the environment, while also ensuring our economy stays strong and creates jobs for American families. We believe in innovation, and we believe in American ingenuity. We've put forward a plan, and we're going to work with Congress to fund the priorities that are important for our country's future. I have faith that members of both parties, when they look at the facts, when they look at what's good for our children and grandchildren, will come together and make responsible decisions. We'll lay out our case, we'll explain why this is important for our economy and our standing in the world, and we'll work through the appropriations process, just like we always do.

And as for what a future President might do, well, that's the nature of our democracy, isn't it? Policies can be debated, and future leaders can change course. But I believe that when America makes a commitment, especially on a challenge as global and as long-term as this, it sends a strong signal. We're talking about a commitment to responsible environmental policy and to leading the world. And I have faith that future leaders, whatever their party, will recognize the importance of these issues and the responsibility we have to tackle them head-on. My job right now is to put us on the right path, and that's exactly what we're doing."
" Thank you, Mr. President. One follow-up on the climate change issue. Are you confident that you can hold the U.S. to its commitments under existing treaties with no new vote needed? And separately, on Planned Parenthood, I wondered if you could share your thoughts on that shooting, and any thoughts in the context of the sharp political rhetoric in the country at this time. ","I apologize, Justin, I didn’t address that but, fortunately, Nancy was batting cleanup after you. On the issue of the climate fund, we already engage in assistance to countries for adaptation, mitigation, sharing technology that can help them meet their energy needs in a clean way. And so this is not just one slug of funding that happens in one year -- this is multiyear commitments that, in many cases, are already embedded in a whole range of programs that we have around the world. And my expectation is, is that we will absolutely be able to meet our commitments. This is part of American leadership, by the way. And this is part of the debate that we have to have in the United States more frequently. For some reason, too often in Washington, American leadership is defined by whether or not we’re sending troops somewhere, and that’s the sole definition of leadership. And part of what I’ve been trying to describe during the course of my presidency is that where we make the most impact -- and where, by the way, we strengthen our relationships and influence the most -- is when we are helping to organize the world around a particular problem. Now, because we’re the largest country, because we have the most powerful military, we should welcome the fact that we’re going to do more and oftentimes we’re going to do it first. So during the Ebola response, other countries could not respond until we had set up the infrastructure to allow other countries to respond, and until we had made the call and showed that we were going to make that investment. The same was true with respect to making sure that Iran didn’t get a nuclear weapon. We had to lead the way, but, ultimately, because we reached out and brought our allies and partners together, we were able to achieve goals that we could not have achieved by ourselves. The same is true with climate. When I made the announcement in Beijing with President Xi, I was able to do so in part because we had led domestically, so I could put my money where my mouth was, and I said, here are the tough political decisions we’re making, now what are you going to do? And once we were able to get China involved that gave confidence to other countries that we were in a position to make a difference as well -- or that they needed to be involved in the process as well. So whether it’s organizing the coalition that’s fighting ISIL, or dealing with climate change, our role is central, but on large international issues like this, it’s not going to be sufficient -- at least not if we want it to take, if we want it to sustain itself. We’ve got to have partners. And that’s the kind of leadership that we should aspire to. With respect to Planned Parenthood, obviously my heart goes out to the families of those impacted. I mean, Nancy, I say this every time we’ve got one of these mass shootings -- this just doesn’t happen in other countries. We are, rightly, determined to prevent terrorist attacks wherever they occur, whether in the United States or with friends and allies like France. And we devote enormous resources -- and properly so -- to rooting out networks and debilitating organizations like ISIL, and maintaining the intelligence and improving the information-sharing that can identify those who would try to kill innocent people. And yet, in the United States, we have the power to do more to prevent what is just a regular process of gun homicides that is unequalled by multiples of 5, 6, 10. And I think the American people understand that. So my hope is, is that, once again, this spurs a conversation and action. And I will continue to present those things that I can do administratively. But in the end of the day, Congress, states, local governments are going to have to act in order to make sure that we’re preventing people who are deranged or have violent tendencies from getting weapons that can magnify the damage that they do. And with respect to Planned Parenthood, I think it’s clear -- I’ve said it before -- they provide health services to women all across the country. Have for generations. In many cases, it’s the only organization that provides health services to impoverished women. And I think it’s fair to have a legitimate, honest debate about abortion. I don’t think that’s something that is beyond the pale of our political discussion; I think it’s a serious, legitimate issue. How we talk about it -- making sure that we’re talking about it factually, accurately, and not demonizing organizations like Planned Parenthood -- I think is important. Jeff Mason.","Well, thank you for those follow-up questions. They're important ones.

On the climate change issue, America is a leader, always has been, and we take our responsibilities seriously. We're committed to responsible stewardship, to innovation, and to protecting our environment for future generations. Now, when it comes to international agreements and commitments, our nation's word is strong. We always look to strike that balance between doing our part for the globe and ensuring that any actions are realistic, fair, and in America's best interest. We've got our own path, our own ingenuity, and we're always going to lead with common sense and a focus on what's right for our economy and our people. We'll uphold our responsibilities, but we'll do it the American way, with smart solutions and without unduly burdening our citizens or our businesses. We can meet challenges without sacrificing our prosperity.

Now, on the matter of the shooting at Planned Parenthood, let me be absolutely clear: Violence is never, ever the answer. What happened there was a despicable act of terror, plain and simple, and my heart goes out to the victims, their families, and all those affected by such a senseless tragedy. We are a nation of laws, and those who commit such crimes will be brought to justice. Period. As for the political rhetoric, look, we live in a free country, and people have strong opinions, and that's okay. We can disagree, we can debate, we can speak our minds with passion. But when that rhetoric spills over into encouraging violence, or making others feel unsafe, then we've crossed a line. We all, every one of us, have a responsibility to conduct ourselves with a measure of civility and respect, even when the issues are tough. We've got to remember we're all Americans, and there's no place for this kind of hatred and violence in our society."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Do you believe that Turkey is doing enough to strengthen its northwest border with Syria? How is it that a NATO country with as large a military as Turkey has, has not sealed its border? And is that something that you raised today with President Erdogan? And then, to put a finer point on the climate change question, can leaders gathered here believe that the United States will keep its commitments, even after you’ve left office, if a Republican succeeds you in the White House? ","Just with respect to my successor, let me, first of all, say that I’m anticipating a Democrat succeeding me. I’m confident in the wisdom of the American people on that front. But even if somebody from a different party succeeded me, one of the things that you find is when you’re in this job, you think about it differently than when you’re just running for the job. And what you realize is what I mentioned earlier, that American leadership involves not just playing to a narrow constituency back home, but you now are, in fact, at the center of what happens around the world, and that your credibility and America’s ability to influence events depends on taking seriously what other countries care about. Now, the fact of the matter is there’s a reason why you have the largest gathering of world leaders probably in human history here in Paris. Everybody else is taking climate change really seriously. They think it’s a really big problem. It spans political parties. You travel around Europe, and you talk to leaders of governments and the opposition, and they are arguing about a whole bunch of things -- one thing they’re not arguing about is whether the science of climate change is real and whether or not we have to do something about it. So whoever is the next President of the United States, if they come in and they suggest somehow that that global consensus -- not just 99.5 percent of scientists and experts, but 99 percent of world leaders -- think this is really important, I think the President of the United States is going to need to think this is really important. And that’s why it’s important for us to not project what’s being said on a campaign trail, but to do what’s right, and make the case. And I would note that the American people, I think in the most recent survey, two-thirds of them said America should be a signatory to any agreement that emerges that is actually addressing climate change in a serious way. So the good news is, the politics inside the United States is changing, as well. Sometimes it may be hard for Republicans to support something that I’m doing, but that’s more a matter of the games Washington plays. And that’s why I think people should be confident that we’ll meet our commitments on this. With respect to Turkey, I have had repeated conversations with President Erdogan about the need to close the border between Turkey and Syria. We’ve seen some serious progress on that front, but there are still some gaps. In particular, there’s about 98 kilometers that are still used as a transit point for foreign fighters, ISIL shipping out fuel for sale that helps finance their terrorist activities. And so we have been having our militaries work together to determine how a combination of air and Turkish ground forces on the Turkish side of the border can do a much better job of sealing the border than currently is. And I think President Erdogan recognizes that. I’m also encouraged by the fact that President Erdogan and the EU had a series of meetings around -- or Turkey and the EU had a series of meetings around the issue of the Turkish-Greek border. We have to remind ourselves, Turkey has taken on an enormous humanitarian effort. There are millions of Syrians who are displaced and living inside of Turkey -- not just refugee camps, but they are now moving into major cities throughout Turkey. That puts enormous strains on their infrastructure, on their housing, on employment. And Turkey has continued to keep those borders open for people in real need. So I’m proud that the United States is the single-largest contributor of humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees. I’m glad that the EU is looking to do more to help Turkey manage those refugee flows. But I also think the EU, rightly, wants to see the kind of orderly process along the Turkish-Greek border that’s necessary for Europe to be able to regulate the amount of refugees it’s absorbing, and to save the lives of refugees who are oftentimes taking enormous risks because they’re being ferried back and forth by human traffickers who are now operating in the same ways that you see drug traffickers operating under -- at enormous profit, and without regard for human life.","Thank you very much. Good questions, good questions. And I appreciate you asking them.

Now, on Turkey, President Erdogan, he's a tough guy, a strong leader, I know him very, very well. We've had some tremendous meetings, some fantastic discussions, the best discussions, frankly. Turkey is a NATO ally, and they have a *very* large military, one of the biggest in the region. We've done a lot for them, frankly, a lot of support.

That border with Syria, it's a very complex situation, a very, very tough border. You have ISIS remnants, you have all sorts of problems there. And Turkey, they're dealing with a lot. Are they doing enough? Well, we always want everyone to do more, don't we? Especially when it comes to security. We discuss these things, every single thing. And believe me, our conversations with President Erdogan, they're always very frank, very direct. We talk about everything, absolutely everything. We're working on it, making progress, tremendous progress. That's all I can tell you.

And on climate change, look, nobody wants clean air and clean water more than me. Nobody. I've always said it. We want a beautiful environment. But what we don't want is to put America last. We don't want to destroy our businesses, our jobs, our industries, based on deals that are frankly, terrible for our country, and that other nations aren't even upholding themselves. They laugh at us. They absolutely laugh at us.

When I talk about commitments, the greatest commitment any President can make is to the American people, to American prosperity, to American jobs. And that's what I've always done. The United States will always do what's right for the United States, for our workers, for our families. And if a Republican, a strong Republican, comes into office, they're going to put America First, just like I did. And they're going to make sure that whatever we do, it's fair, it's balanced, and it doesn't give a tremendous advantage to other countries that are simply not doing their share. It's about common sense. It's about smart deals. And that's what America is all about."
 Did you raise the border issue with him today? ,"We talked about it today, but I guess what I’m saying, Jeff, is this has been an ongoing conversation. We recognize that this is a central part of our anti-ISIL strategy. We’ve got to choke them off. We have to choke off how they make money. We’ve got to choke off their ability to bring in new fighters. Because we’ve taken tens of thousands of their fighters off the battlefield, but if new ones are still coming in, then they continue to maintain a stranglehold over certain population centers inside of Iraq or Syria. So we’ve got to cut off their source of new fighters. That’s also part of the great danger for Europe, and ultimately the United States, as well, and countries as far-flung as Australia or Singapore. If you’ve got foreign fighters coming in that are getting not only ideologically hardened but battle-hardened, and then they’re returning to their home countries, they’re likely candidates for engaging in the kind of terrorist attacks that we saw here in Paris. So this has been ongoing concern and we’re going to continue to push hard among all our allies to cut off the financing, cut off the foreign fighters, improve our intelligence-gathering, which has allowed us to accelerate the strikes that we’re taking against ISIL. A lot of the discussion over the last couple of weeks was the pace of airstrikes. The pace of airstrikes is not constrained by the amount of planes or missiles that we have; the pace has been dictated by how many effective targets do we have. And our intelligence continues to improve. And the better we get at that, the better we’re going to be at going after them. Scott Horsley.","You bet your bottom dollar I did. The security of our nation, the rule of law, and the integrity of our borders are absolutely paramount. It was a very frank and direct conversation, and we laid out what needs to be done to get the situation under control. This isn't just an issue; it's a crisis, and it demands our full attention."
" Mr. President, you're going to California today. And as you said earlier this week, you told the nation that there’s no specific or credible threat of a similar attack. But how is it really possible to know? I mean, aren’t similar plots going to be just as hard to detect beforehand? And some lawmakers are saying that your government should review the social media of all people applying for visas to come to this country. What do you think of that idea? Should that be mandatory? ","Well, Roberta, you’re absolutely right that it is very difficult for us to detect lone wolf plots -- or plots involving a husband and wife, in this case -- because despite the incredible vigilance and professionalism of all our law enforcement, homeland security, et cetera, it’s not that different from us trying to detect the next mass shooter. You don’t always see it. They’re not always communicating publicly, and if you’re not catching what they say publicly, then it becomes a challenge. We are continuing to work at every level to make sure that there’s no slip between information-sharing among agencies. We’re continuing to strengthen our information-sharing with foreign countries. And because, in part, of the tragedy in Paris, I think you’re seeing much greater cooperation from our European partners on these issues. But this is a different kind of challenge than the sort that we had with an organization like al Qaeda that involved highly trained operatives who are working as cells or as a network. Here, essentially, you have ISIL trying to encourage or induce somebody who may be prey to this kind of propaganda. And it becomes more difficult to see. It does mean that they’re less likely to be able to carry out large, complex attacks. But as we saw in San Bernardino, obviously, you can still do enormous damage. The issue of reviewing social media for those who are obtaining visas I think may have gotten garbled a little bit, because there may be -- it’s important to distinguish between posts that are public -- social media on a Facebook page -- versus private communications through various social media or apps. And our law enforcement and intelligence professionals are constantly monitoring public posts, and that is part of the visa review process, that people are investigating what individuals have said publicly and questioned about any statements that they maybe made. But if you have a private communication between two individuals, that’s harder to discern, by definition. And one of the things we’ll be doing is engaging with the high-tech community to find out how we can, in an appropriate way, do a better job if we have a lead to be able to track a suspected terrorist. But we’re going to have to recognize that no government is going to have the capacity to read every single person’s text or emails or social media. If it’s not posted publicly, then there are going to be feasibility issues that are probably insurmountable at some level, and it raises questions about our values. I mean, keep in mind it was only a couple of years ago where we were having a major debate about whether the government was becoming too much like Big Brother. And overall, I think we’ve struck the right balance in protecting civil liberties and making sure that U.S. citizens’ privacy is preserved, that we are making sure that there’s oversight to what our intelligence agencies do. But we’re going to have to continue to balance our needs for security with people’s legitimate concerns about privacy. And because the Internet is global and communication systems are global, the values that we apply here oftentimes are ones that folks who are trying to come into the country are also benefitting from because they’re using the same technologies. But this is precisely why we’re working very hard to bring law enforcement, intelligence, and high-tech companies together. Because we’re going to have to really review what we can do both technically as well as consistent with our laws and our values in order to try to discern more rapidly some of the potential threats that may be out there. David Jackson.","Well, good morning. And thank you for the question. It's an important one, and I appreciate you raising it because it's on a lot of Americans' minds.

First, let me be absolutely clear about what I said earlier this week. When we state there is no *specific, credible* threat to our nation right now, that means our intelligence agencies, our law enforcement, the men and women who work around the clock, haven't uncovered an *actionable* plot with a particular target here in the United States. That's a critical distinction. It doesn't mean there's no risk. We live in a dangerous world, and those who wish us harm are constantly seeking to exploit any vulnerability.

But let me tell you this: we have the finest intelligence community in the world. We have dedicated law enforcement professionals who are constantly monitoring, constantly analyzing every piece of information, every signal. We have multiple layers of defense, from our borders to our airports to our communities. We are vigilant, we are adapting, and we are working tirelessly to stay one step ahead of the terrorists. Protecting the American people is my most solemn duty, and we take it very, very seriously.

Now, regarding the idea of reviewing social media for visa applicants – that's something we've been looking at very closely, and frankly, it makes a lot of sense. We have a sacred obligation to protect our citizens, and that means we must have the most robust vetting processes possible for anyone seeking to enter our country.

Our current systems are strong, but the world has changed, technology has changed, and so too must our methods. Social media platforms, for better or worse, often provide insights into an individual's intentions, their beliefs, and their associations. If someone is applying for the privilege of coming to the United States, we have a right, and an obligation, to know who they are and whether they pose any risk to our national security or our way of life.

We need to use every tool at our disposal to ensure that we are making the most informed decisions possible. This isn't about infringing on privacy for our own citizens, but about thoroughly vetting those who wish to enter our sovereign nation. It's about strengthening our security and giving our brave men and women at the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department the information they need to protect this country. So, yes, we are absolutely exploring ways to integrate all available information, including social media, into our vetting processes to make them as secure and as comprehensive as possible. It's a matter of national security, plain and simple."
" Thank you, Mr. President. A Gitmo question. Congress has made it pretty clear that they’re just not going to let you transfer prisoners to the United States for trial. But some people think you already have the executive authority to transfer those prisoners and close Gitmo itself next year. My question is, do you believe you have that authority and are you willing to exercise it to close that place? ","Well, first of all, we’ve been working systematically -- another example of persistence -- in reducing the population. We have a review process. Those who are eligible for transfer we locate in countries that have accepted some of these detainees. They monitor them, and it’s been determined that they can be transferred. And my expectation is by early next year, we should have reduced that population below 100. And we will continue to steadily chip away at the numbers in Guantanamo. There’s going to come to a point where we have an irreducible population -- people who pose a significant threat, but for various reasons, it’s difficult for us to try them in an Article III court. Some of those folks are going through a military commission process. But there’s going to be a challenge there. Now, at that stage, I’m presenting a plan to Congress about how we can close Guantanamo. I’m not going to automatically assume that Congress says no. I’m not being coy, David. I think it’s fair to say that there’s going to be significant resistance from some quarters to that. But I think we can make a very strong argument that it doesn’t make sense for us to be spending an extra $100 million, $200 million, $300 million, $500 million, a billion dollars, to have a secure setting for 50, 60, 70 people. And we will wait until Congress has definitively said no to a well-thought-out plan with numbers attached to it before we say anything definitive about my executive authority here. I think it’s far preferable if I can get stuff done with Congress.","Thank you for that question. Look, let me be absolutely clear about Gitmo. My top priority, first and foremost, is the security of the American people and the protection of this nation from those who seek to do us harm. We established Guantanamo Bay for a very specific reason: to hold dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield, outside the United States, who cannot be safely released and for whom traditional U.S. criminal courts were not designed.

Now, regarding the authority you mentioned. The President of the United States has inherent constitutional authority as Commander-in-Chief to protect our nation and make decisions concerning the disposition of enemy combatants. Make no mistake, I believe the executive branch *does* possess the necessary authority to make decisions about the detention and transfer of these individuals, and indeed, about the future of the facility itself.

We have consistently engaged with Congress on this complex issue. I respect their role and their concerns. But the ultimate responsibility for national security rests with the President. We are always evaluating our options, and I will use every lawful tool at my disposal to ensure our safety, to protect our troops, and to uphold justice. We will do what is necessary to keep America safe, consistent with our values and the Constitution."
 So actually you could -- right -- on your own? ,"David, as I said -- and I think you’ve seen me on a whole bunch of issues like immigration -- I’m not going to be forward-leaning on what I can do without Congress before I’ve tested what I can do with Congress. And every once in a while, they’ll surprise you, and this may be one of those places -- because I think we can make a really strong argument. Guantanamo continues to be one of the key magnets for jihadi recruitment. To Roberta’s question earlier about how do they propagandize and convince somebody here in the United States who may not have a criminal record or a history of terrorist activity to start shooting -- this is part of what they feed, this notion of a gross injustice, that America is not living up to its professed ideals. We know that. We see the Internet traffic. We see how Guantanamo has been used to create this mythology that America is at war with Islam. And for us to close it is part of our counterterrorism strategy that is supported by our military, our diplomatic, and our intelligence teams. So when you combine that with the fact that it’s really expensive that we are essentially at this point detaining a handful of people and each person is costing several million dollars to detain, when there are more efficient ways of doing it, I think we can make a strong argument. But I’ll take your point that it will be an uphill battle. Now, every battle I’ve had with Congress over the last five years has been uphill. But we keep on surprising you by actually getting some stuff done. Sometimes that may prove necessary, but we try not to get out ahead of ourselves on that. Julie Pace.","Well, you know, that's a good question, and it gets to the heart of what leadership is all about. While you always surround yourself with the best people – you build a great team, you get expert advice, you listen to a lot of different voices – ultimately, when it comes time to make the big decisions, when the buck stops, it comes down to you.

You've got to be able to weigh all that information, trust your gut, and then make the call. And frankly, yes, you've got to be prepared to stand on your own two feet and carry that responsibility. That's what the job demands, and that's what the American people expect."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about some of the broader challenges in the Middle East. Some of the Republicans who are running for President have argued that the Mideast and the United States would be safer if we hadn’t had regime change in places like Iraq, Libya, and Egypt. And having gone through the experience of the Arab Spring and the aftermath, I wonder what you now see the U.S. role in the Middle East in terms of trying to push dictators out of power. Would you advise future presidents to call for authoritarian leaders to step down as you did? And just specifically on Syria, at this point, is it your expectation that Bashar Assad’s presidency will outlast yours? ","There’s been a lot of revisionist history, sometimes by the same people making different arguments depending on the situation. So maybe it’s useful just for us to go back over some of these issues. We did not depose Hosni Mubarak. Millions of Egyptians did, because of their dissatisfaction with the corruption and authoritarianism of the regime. We had a working relationship with Mubarak. We didn't trigger the Arab Spring. And the notion that somehow the U.S. was in a position to pull the strings on a country that is the largest in the Arab world I think is mistaken. What is true is that at the point at which the choice becomes mowing down millions of people, or trying to find some transition -- we believed, and I would still argue that it was more sensible for us to find a peaceful transition to the Egyptian situation. With respect to Libya, Libya is sort of a alternative version of Syria in some ways, because by the time the international coalition interceded in Syria, chaos had already broken out. You already had the makings of a civil war. You had a dictator who was threatening and was in a position to carry out the wholesale slaughter of large numbers of people. And we worked under U.N. mandate with a coalition of folks in order to try to avert a big humanitarian catastrophe that would not have been good for us. Those who now argue, in retrospect, we should have left Qaddafi in there seem to forget that he had already lost legitimacy and control of his country, and we could have -- instead of what we have in Libya now, we could have had another Syria in Libya now. The problem with Libya was the fact that there was a failure on the part of the entire international community -- and I think that the United States has some accountability for not moving swiftly enough and underestimating the need to rebuild government there quickly -- and as a consequence, you now have a very bad situation. And as far as Syria goes, I think it is entirely right and proper for the United States of America to speak out on behalf of its values. And when you have an authoritarian leader that is killing hundreds of thousands of his own people, the notion that we would just stand by and say nothing is contrary to who we are. And that does not serve our interests -- because, at that point, us being in collusion with that kind of governance would make us even more of a target for terrorist activity, would --","Well, thank you. Thank you for that question. It's an important one, and it's right to reflect on these things as we look back and look ahead.

Look, my conviction that freedom is God's gift to all humanity, that hasn't changed. And I believe the United States, as the beacon of liberty, has a moral obligation to stand with those who yearn to be free.

When it comes to places like Iraq, after 9/11, we faced a clear and present danger. Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator, he harbored terrorists, and he had a history with weapons of mass destruction. We made a decision to remove a great threat to the American people and to give the Iraqi people a chance at freedom. The path to freedom, folks, is rarely straight. It's certainly not easy. We learned that building stable, democratic institutions takes time, effort, and a whole lot of sacrifice – from our troops and from the people themselves.

What happened in Libya and Egypt during the Arab Spring, those were different circumstances, driven by internal uprisings, and our role was different. But the underlying principle, that people want to be free, that's universal.

My advice to future presidents would be this: Stay true to our values. Support human dignity and the cause of freedom wherever you can. But understand the full weight of what it means to support freedom, and the difficult, long-term work that follows. It's one thing to remove a tyrant; it's another thing entirely to help a nation build lasting, free institutions that respect the rights of all citizens. We can't impose democracy from the barrel of a gun. We can stand with those who choose freedom, but the ultimate success rests with the people of those nations. We've got to be smart, realistic, and patient, understanding the culture and the history.

As for Syria, Bashar al-Assad is a tyrant who gassed his own people. It's a profound tragedy what has befallen Syria, and my hope, always, has been for the Syrian people to be free from his oppressive rule. It’s a stark reminder of the long struggle for freedom and how brutal these regimes are in clinging to power. It's clear that the path to a free Syria remains incredibly complex and heartbreaking."
 Do you think that government can cope -- try to stop extremists from -- ,"The reason that Assad has been a problem in Syria is because that is a majority-Sunni country and he had lost the space that he had early on to execute an inclusive transition -- peaceful transition. He chose instead to slaughter people. And once that happened, the idea that a minority population there could somehow crush tens of millions of people who oppose him is not feasible. It’s not plausible. Even if you were being cold-eyed and hard-hearted about the human toll there, it just wouldn’t happen. And as a consequence, our view has been that you cannot bring peace to Syria, you cannot get an end to the civil war unless you have a government that is recognized as legitimate by a majority of that country. It will not happen. And this is the argument that I’ve had repeatedly with Mr. Putin, dating five years ago, at which time his suggestion -- as I gather some Republicans are now suggesting -- was Assad is not so bad, let him just be as brutal and repressive as he can, but at least he’ll keep order. I said, look, the problem is that the history of trying to keep order when a large majority of the country has turned against you is not good. And five years later, I was right. So we now have an opportunity -- and John Kerry is meeting as we speak with Syria and Turkey and Iran and the Gulf countries and other parties who are interested -- we now have an opportunity not to turn back the clock -- it’s going to be very difficult to completely overcome the devastation that’s happened in Syria already -- but to find a political transition that maintains the Syrian state, that recognizes there are a bunch of a stakeholders inside of Syria, and hopefully, to initiate a ceasefire that won’t be perfect but allows all the parties to turn on what should be our number-one focus, and that is destroying Daesh and its allies in the region. And that is going to be a difficult process. It’s going to be a painstaking process. But there is no shortcut to that. And that’s not based on some idealism on my part; that’s a hard-headed calculation about what’s going to be required to get the job done.","Well, that's a profoundly important question, and it's one that every president, indeed every American, grapples with. Our nation has always faced down threats, both foreign and domestic, and extremism, in whatever form it takes, is a serious challenge to our values and our way of life.

Now, can the government cope? Absolutely, it can – and it *must*. We have sophisticated intelligence agencies, dedicated law enforcement professionals, and a justice system built to protect our citizens and uphold the rule of law. It's a complex endeavor, requiring vigilance, cooperation across all levels of government, and strong partnerships with communities. We have to be smart, we have to be tough, and we have to be relentless in protecting our freedoms.

But let me be clear: Stopping extremism isn't just about government action. It's also about strengthening the fabric of our society, promoting civility, and ensuring that the vast majority of good, decent Americans have their voices heard over the fringe elements. We fight extremism not by compromising our principles, but by standing firm on them – by defending democracy, freedom, and the right to disagree without resorting to violence. We are a resilient nation, and I have every confidence in our ability to confront and overcome these challenges."
" Do you think that Assad, though, potentially could remain in power a year from now? ","I think that Assad is going to have to leave in order for the country to stop the bloodletting and for all the parties involved to be able to move forward in a non- sectarian way. He has lost legitimacy in the eyes of a large majority of the country. Now, is there a way of us constructing a bridge creating a political transition that allows those who are allied with Assad right now -- allows the Russians, allows the Iranians to ensure that their equities are respected, that minorities like the Alawites are not crushed or retribution is not the order of the day -- I think that’s going to be very important as well. And that’s what makes this so difficult. Sadly, had Assad made a decision earlier that he was not more important personally than his entire country, that kind of political transition would have been much easier. It’s a lot harder now. But John Kerry has been doing some excellent work in moving that process forward. And I do think that you’ve seen from the Russians a recognition that, after a couple of months, they’re not really moving the needle that much, despite a sizeable deployment inside of Syria. And of course, that’s what I suggested would happen -- because there’s only so much bombing you can do when an entire country is outraged and believes that its ruler doesn’t represent them. Cheryl Bolen.","Well now, that's a question that keeps a lot of folks up at night, isn't it? The situation in Syria, with President Assad... it's just a tragedy, what's happened to those people, what that regime has done to its own citizens.

Could he remain in power a year from now? Look, I wish I could tell you definitively 'no,' because what he represents, what he's done, that's just unacceptable. But the reality on the ground is complicated. You've got countries like Russia and Iran heavily invested in propping him up, and the opposition, for all their bravery, they've been fractured and face immense challenges.

So, when you look at the forces at play, the international support he's receiving, the unfortunate truth is that yes, it's certainly *possible* he could still be there. It's not what anyone who cares about human rights or a stable, democratic future for Syria wants to see. But sometimes in foreign policy, you're dealing with very, very difficult realities. We've got to keep working for a political solution, for a better way forward for the Syrian people, but predicting the exact timeline there... that's a tough one."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I’d like to ask you about the surprising Congress. Specifically, what are your top legislative priorities for next year? And how has the new Speaker, Paul Ryan, changed the dynamic with you and Capitol Hill? And can you be more ambitious next year, doing things like maybe completing the Transatlantic Trade Partnership, or even getting tax reform? ","Well, first of all, it’s important to give some credit where credit is due. John Boehner did a favor to all of us, including now Speaker Ryan, by working with us to agree on a topline budget framework. That was the basis for subsequent negotiations. He was able to do that because he was going out the door, and was then given, I think, a little more room to maneuver than he previously had. Having said that, I also want to give Speaker Ryan credit. I called both him and Mitch McConnell, as well as Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, for the orderly way in which they actually negotiated a budget -- the way Congress is historically and typically supposed to work. I mean, we’ve gotten kind of used to last-minute crises and shutdown threats, and so forth. And this is a messy process that doesn’t satisfy everybody completely, but it’s more typical of American democracy. And I think that Speaker Ryan deserves a role in that. I will say that in his interactions with me, he has been professional, he has reached out to tell me what he can do and what he cannot do. I think it’s a good working relationship. We recognize that we disagree on a whole bunch of other stuff and have fundamentally different visions for where we want to move the country. But perhaps because even before he was elected he had worked on Capitol Hill, I think he is respectful of the process and respectful of how legislation works. So kudos to him, as well as all the leaders and appropriators who were involved in this process. Now, I just want to repeat -- because sometimes we take for granted what’s happened -- I said early on in this process that I wasn’t going to sign a budget that did not relieve sequester, this artificial austerity that was making it difficult for us to invest in things like education and our military. And I said I would not accept a lot of ideological riders that were attached to a big budget deal. And we met our goals. And because of some terrific negotiations by the Democrats up on Capitol Hill and I think some pretty good work by our legislative staff here, we’re going to be able to fund environmental protection. We’re going to be able to make sure that we’re investing in things like early childhood education and making college more affordable. We’re going to be able to implement the Clean Power Plan rule. We’re going to be able to continue to invest in clean energy that spurs on innovation. We’re going to be able to make sure that our military gets the equipment and the training that it needs in order to be effective in fighting ISIL and other threats around the world. So it was a good win. And there are some things in there that I don't like, but that's the nature of legislation and compromise. And I think the system worked. That gives me some optimism that next year, on a narrow set of issues, we can get some more work done. Now, as David said, it’s an election year. And obviously a lot of the legislative process is going to be skewed by people looking over their shoulders, worrying about primaries, trying to position themselves relative to the presidential candidates. So that makes it harder. But I think there are going to be a handful of areas where we can make real progress. One of them you already mentioned -- Trans-Pacific Partnership, which now has been out, Congress has had a chance to review. And it meets the bar that I set. It is consistent with what I promised, which is the most pro-labor, pro-environment, progressive trade deal in history, that eliminates just about every tariff on American manufacturing goods in countries that up until this point have charged a tax, essentially, on anything that American workers and American businesses sell in these areas. It brings those taxes down to zero on basically all American-manufactured products -- a huge win for agriculture, because now the people of Japan are going to be in a better position to enjoy American beef and American pork, which up until this point, even though we're much more efficient producers, has been tagged with a tax that makes our products uncompetitive in Japanese markets. So this is a big deal. And I think Speaker Ryan would like to try to get it done. And there are both proponents and opponents of this in both Democratic and Republican parties, and so it’s going to be an interesting situation where we're going to have to stitch together the same kind of bipartisan effort in order for us to get it done. A second area that I think is possible is criminal justice reform. There has been sincere, serious negotiations and efforts by Democrats and Republicans to create a criminal justice system that is more fair, more evenhanded, more proportionate, and is smarter about how we reduce crime. And I’ve really been impressed by the dedication of a core group of Democrats and Republicans -- some of them, the most liberal Democrats and the most conservative Republicans -- coming together saying this is the right thing to do. We’ve got a good bill in the Senate that passed with bipartisan support out of committee. My hope is, is that gets to the floor, and that we can pair it up with a good bill out of the House. And this is an area where you potentially can see us save money, reduce recidivism, make sure that people who make a mistake on nonviolent crimes have to pay the price, have to serve time, but are released in a reasonable fashion, that they have more support so that they're less likely to go back into the criminal system subsequently. And that's an area where I think we may be able to make a big difference. So those are just two examples. We’ll keep on looking for a number of examples like that. And wherever there’s an opportunity, I’m going to take it. Philip Crowther.","Thank you for that, a very important question. It's good to be here with you today.

Look, my top priority, always, is the American people. And as we look to the next year, our legislative agenda is laser-focused on three core principles: **economic growth, national security, and getting our fiscal house in order.**

First and foremost, we've got to keep this economy moving forward, building on the progress we've made. That means continuing to cut down on burdensome regulations that stifle innovation and job creation. We need to empower our small businesses, which are the engine of this economy, and ensure American workers have the skills they need to compete and win.

Secondly, national security remains paramount. We face real threats, both at home and abroad, and we must ensure our military is the strongest in the world, our intelligence agencies are fully supported, and our borders are secure. Protecting the American people is the most solemn duty I have.

And third, frankly, we've got to address our nation's spending. We need to restore fiscal sanity, make tough choices to balance our budget, and ensure we're not passing unsustainable debt onto our children and grandchildren. That means reforming entitlement programs and making government more efficient and accountable. And yes, fixing our broken healthcare system, putting patients and doctors back in charge, not Washington bureaucrats.

Now, you asked about Speaker Paul Ryan. He's a serious man, a good man, and a true conservative with a deep understanding of policy and the challenges facing our nation. He's brought a tremendous amount of intellectual rigor and energy to the Speakership. Has it changed the dynamic? Absolutely. He's a dedicated leader who is working tirelessly to unify the Conference, to articulate a clear conservative vision, and to put forward bold, common-sense solutions. We talk regularly, and I appreciate his partnership, his steady hand, and his commitment to tackling big issues. It's a challenging job, but he's approaching it with conviction, and that's exactly what we need.

Can we be more ambitious? My friend, we *must* be more ambitious for the American people. We have to be. Let me tell you:

The **Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP**—that's a big, complex undertaking, no doubt about it. But I believe strongly in free and fair trade. It opens new markets for American goods and services, it creates high-paying jobs right here at home, and it ensures that American businesses can compete on a level playing field globally. We are absolutely committed to getting a deal that benefits American workers and businesses, that expands opportunity, and strengthens our economic ties with our European partners. It's a negotiation, and we're working hard, but it's a priority.

And **tax reform**? That is at the very, very top of our agenda. Our current tax code is a mess, it's outdated, it's stifling innovation and growth. It puts American businesses at a disadvantage against their foreign competitors. We need to simplify it, make it fairer for families and businesses, and lower rates so American companies can invest, expand, and create jobs right here in America. It's a heavy lift, no question, but it is long overdue, and I believe with Speaker Ryan's leadership and a united Congress, we can get it done. It will unleash the full potential of our economy.

We are ready to roll up our sleeves and work together to deliver real results for the American people. Thank you."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned climate change already. And at the time of the signing of the deal in Paris, you said it was potentially a turning point for the world. But this was a deal that is not a legally binding document. And you bypassed Congress pretty much completely. Are you worried at this point that a Republican president who might take over from you in the White House could stop the deal in its tracks entirely? And considering that possibility, are you more interested in campaigning for a Democratic nominee, considering that danger? ","I think it’s fair to say I was going to be campaigning for a Democratic nominee even without that danger. And I am very confident that we're going to have a terrific Democratic nominee and -- [cellphone rings] -- whose phone is that, guys? Come on, now. Somebody -- you recognize your ring. Don’t be embarrassed. Just turn it off. There you go. Okay. Can I still hear it? I think it’s off now. 0 I think we will have a strong Democratic nominee. I think that Democratic nominee will win. I think I will have a Democratic successor. And I will campaign very hard to make that happen -- for a whole variety of reasons -- because they're far more likely to share my fundamental vision about where America should go. But having said that, what I think people should also feel good about is that the agreement struck in Paris, although not legally binding when it comes to the targets that had been set, does create this architecture in which all around the world, countries are saying, this is where we’re going. We’re going to be chasing after this clean energy future. This is how we’re going to meet our goals. We’re going to double down on solar power. We’re going to double down on wind power. We’re going to invest more heavily in biofuels. We’re going to figure out battery technologies. And what you saw in this budget, which I think was really significant, was an extension of the solar tax credits and wind tax credits that we had helped to really boost early on in my administration and that resulted in wind power increasing threefold, solar power increasing by twentyfold. Those tax credits are now going to be extended for five to seven years. And as a consequence, that combination of market signals means that the private sector is going to start investing much more heavily. They know this is coming. And it’s not just coming here - - it’s coming around the world. So you now have a global marketplace for clean energy that is stable and accelerating over the course of the next decade. That then creates a different dynamic that is independent of what Congress does, but also helps to shape what Congress does. Because the more people that are now getting jobs in solar installation and production, the more that you have companies who are seeing how American innovation can sell products in clean energy all across the Asia Pacific and in Europe and in Africa, suddenly there’s a big monetary incentive to getting this right. And that’s been the history of environmental progress in this country, and now we’ve exported it around the world. Every time we’ve made a decision, “you know what, we’re going to have clean air,” the predictions were everything would fall apart. And lo and behold, it turns out that American innovation makes getting clean air a lot less expensive than people expected and it happens a lot faster than expected. When we made a decision that we were going to double fuel-efficiency standards on cars, everybody said, oh, this is going to ruin the American auto industry. The American auto industry has been booming over the last couple years. Acid rain -- when George H.W. Bush instituted a system to charge for the emissions that were causing acid rain, everybody said, well, you can’t do that, that’s going to ruin business. And it turned out it was smoother, faster, quicker, better. 1 And acid rain folks who were born -- I don’t know -- some of you reporters are getting younger, or I’m getting older -- may not remember it, but that was a big deal. Now most folks don’t even remember it anymore, because it got solved. And there’s no reason why the same won’t happen here. Now, do I think that there’s going to be a lot of noise and campaigning next year about how we’re going to stop Paris in its tracks? There will probably be a lot of noise like that. Do I actually think that, two years from now, three years from now, even Republican members of Congress are going to look at it and say, that’s a smart thing to do? I don’t think they will. Keep in mind that, right now, the American Republican Party is the only major party that I can think of in the advanced world that effectively denies climate change. I mean, it’s an outlier. Many of the key signatories to this deal, the architects of this deal come from center-right governments. Even the far-right parties in many of these countries -- they may not like immigrants, for example, but they admit, yes, the science tells us we’ve got to do something about climate change. So my sense is, is that this is something that may be an advantage in terms of short-term politics and a Republican primary. It’s not something that is going to be a winner for Republicans long term.","Well, thank you for that question, son. It's a critical one, and it gets to the heart of how we make progress on global challenges.

When we gathered in Paris, and when I said it was a potential turning point for the world, I meant every word of it. For the first time, nearly every nation on Earth came together and agreed to a common framework to tackle climate change. That wasn't just a political achievement; it was a profound statement of collective human intent.

Now, you're right, it's not a legally binding treaty in the traditional sense, ratified by the Senate. That's a deliberate design choice that actually strengthened the agreement by allowing broader participation and flexibility. The power of Paris isn't just in the legal clauses; it's in the *commitments* that each nation made, the transparency framework, and the global market signals it sent. When businesses, investors, and innovators see the whole world moving in one direction, they respond. The shift to clean energy, to a more sustainable future, is already underway, driven by economic opportunity as much as environmental necessity.

As for bypassing Congress, let's be clear: this was an executive agreement, consistent with existing U.S. law and the President's authority in foreign policy. It wasn't about circumventing our democratic process; it was about ensuring America could lead on the world stage, fulfilling our responsibility to future generations, and protecting our own national interests. We couldn't afford to wait.

Now, am I worried about a future president, particularly a Republican one, who might try to pull us out or roll back our commitments? Of course, that's a legitimate concern, and we've seen those kinds of actions before. But here's what gives me hope: the momentum we built in Paris is bigger than any single presidency.

Think about it:
*   **States and cities** across America are stepping up, setting their own ambitious goals.
*   **American businesses** are already investing billions in clean energy because it makes economic sense, creates jobs, and their shareholders demand it.
*   **The rest of the world** won't simply stand by if one nation tries to backtrack. The diplomatic pressure, the economic incentives for staying in the race for clean energy leadership—they are powerful.

So, while a future administration could certainly make things harder, slow down progress, or even damage America's standing, they can't stop the underlying trajectory of innovation and global commitment. The clean energy transition is happening. It's inevitable. The question for America is whether we'll lead it or fall behind.

And yes, absolutely, I'm always interested in supporting leaders who understand the urgency of this challenge, who believe in science, and who recognize America's indispensable role in tackling it. My focus, and my efforts, will always be dedicated to ensuring that the progress we made, the future we are building, continues to move forward, for the good of all Americans and for the world. We need consistent, steady leadership that looks to the future, not back at old debates."
 You mentioned American leadership. Is it embarrassing to you that the other party denies climate change? ,"No -- because, first of all, I’m not a member of that party. Second of all, it didn’t stop us from being the key leader in getting this done. I mean, this is something I’ve been working on now for five, six years. When I went to Copenhagen, I essentially engaged in 24 hours of diplomacy to salvage from a pretty chaotic process the basic principle that all countries had to participate, that we couldn’t have a rigid division between developed countries and developing countries when it came to solving this problem. That was the initial foundation for us then working with other countries, culminating in the joint announcement with China, bringing in India, bringing in Brazil and the other big, emerging countries, working with the Europeans and getting this done. This would not have happened without American leadership. And, by the way, the same is true for the Iran nuclear deal. The same is true for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The same is true for stamping out Ebola -- something, you guys may recall from last year, which was the potential end of the world. At each juncture, what we’ve said is, is that American strength and American exceptionalism is not just a matter of us bombing somebody. More often, it’s a matter of us convening, setting the agenda, pointing other nations in a direction that’s good for everybody and good for U.S. interests, engaging in painstaking diplomacy, leading by example. 2 And sometimes the results don’t come overnight, they don’t come the following day, but they come. And this year, what you really saw was that steady, persistent leadership on many initiatives that I began when I first came into office. All right. I’ve got April Ryan.","Well, listen, in America, we've always prided ourselves on a vigorous debate about the best way forward for our country. There are different approaches to every challenge, and when it comes to something as complex as our environment and energy future, it's natural that folks are going to have different ideas on how to tackle it.

What I know is this: America leads the world in innovation. We lead in protecting our land, our air, and our water. We're always finding new ways to develop energy, grow our economy, and make things better for the next generation. We don't need to be embarrassed by open discussion; we need to be focused on solutions that work for the American people, that keep our economy strong, and that demonstrate American leadership on the world stage. That's how we've always done it, and that's how we'll continue to lead."
" Mr. President, I want to ask you something on criminal justice, or that something you said also -- something from Julie Pace. Your administration contends the United States is 5 percent of the world population, but 25 percent of the global jailed population. What legislation are you supporting that significantly cuts mass incarceration in this country? And going back to the Assad issue, does Assad have to go to defeat ISIS? ","Well, we’re going to defeat ISIS, and we’re going to do so by systematically squeezing them, cutting off their supply lines, cutting off their financing, taking out their leadership, taking out their forces, taking out their infrastructure. We’re going to do so in partnership with forces on the ground -- that sometimes are spotty, sometimes need capacity-building, need our assistance, need our training -- but we’re seeing, steadily, progress in many of these areas. And so they’re going to be on the run. Now, they are going to continue to be dangerous. So let me just be very clear -- because whenever I say that we have made progress in squeezing the territory that they control, or made real inroads against them, what people will say is, well, if something happens around the world, then obviously that must not be true. But in any battle, in any fight, even as you make progress, there are still dangers involved. And ISIL’s capacity both to infiltrate Western countries with people who’ve traveled to Syria or traveled to Iraq, and the savviness of their social media, their ability to recruit disaffected individuals who may be French or British or even U.S. citizens, will continue to make them dangerous for quite some time. But we will systematically go after them. Now, in order for us to stamp them out thoroughly, we have to eliminate lawless areas in which they cannot still roam. So we can disable them, we can dismantle much of their infrastructure, greatly reduce the threat that they pose to the United States, our allies and our neighbors. But, in the same way that al Qaeda is pinned down and has much more difficulty carrying out any significant attacks because of how we’ve systematically dismantled them, they still pose a threat. There are still operatives who are interested in carrying out terrorist attacks because they still operate in areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan, or more prominently right now, in Yemen, that are hard to reach. Our long-term goal has to be able to stabilize these areas so that they don’t have any safe haven. And in order for us to do that in Syria, there has to be an end to the civil war, and there has to be an actual government that has a police capacity and a structure in these areas that currently aren’t governed. And it is my firm belief and the belief of the experts in this administration, that so long as Assad is there, we cannot achieve that kind of stability inside of Syria. And I think the history over the last several years indicates as much. 3 So that’s going to continue to be a top priority for us, moving aggressively on the military track and not letting ISIL take a breath, and pounding away at them with our Special Forces and our airstrikes, and the training and advising of partners who can go after them. But we also have to keep very aggressive on this diplomatic track in order for us to bring countries together. All right? Everybody --","Look, that's a very fair question, and Julie Pace is a good reporter. When you look at those numbers – 5 percent of the world's population, 25 percent of the incarcerated population – it tells you we have a situation that needs addressing, plain and simple. We're the greatest country in the world, and we need to do things smarter.

My administration has been absolutely committed to real, common-sense criminal justice reform, not just rhetoric. That's why we pushed for, and proudly signed into law, the **First Step Act**. That was landmark legislation, folks. It was bipartisan, which is rare in Washington, and it made significant changes at the federal level.

What does it do? It's about giving non-violent offenders a second chance, particularly those who've been caught up in outdated sentencing schemes. We're talking about giving them opportunities for job training, for education, for faith-based programs while they're incarcerated, and then helping them re-enter society successfully. It's about reducing recidivism – that means people who get out, stay out, and become productive citizens. Because a person with a good job, a good family, who pays taxes, is far less likely to commit another crime. This isn't about being soft on crime; it's about being *smart* on crime. We're keeping the dangerous criminals locked up, believe me, but for others, we're building pathways to redemption. It's a tremendous success, and we're seeing great results.

Now, on the issue of Assad. Let me be very, very clear: Bashar al-Assad is a brutal dictator. He's a terrible human being, gassing his own people, aligning himself with Iran, a state sponsor of terror. He is not a good guy, not by a long shot.

But when we talk about defeating ISIS, the Islamic State, those butchers, that is a separate, immediate, and paramount threat. ISIS is pure evil. They want to kill us, they want to kill everybody who doesn't agree with their twisted ideology. Our absolute, number one focus has been, and always will be, on crushing ISIS, eliminating their caliphate, destroying them wherever they raise their ugly head.

Do we want Assad gone? Absolutely. But the question is, does his regime *have* to go *first* to defeat ISIS? Not necessarily. In fact, trying to do too many things at once can sometimes make the situation even worse, create more chaos, more vacuums for terrorists to fill. We've seen that movie before. Our strategy has been to empower our allies on the ground, to use overwhelming American military strength to take out ISIS, and frankly, we've made tremendous progress. We have virtually decimated their territorial caliphate, believe me. We deal with the terrorists first, and then we'll deal with the broader regional challenges, including bad actors like Assad, in due course. But first, you take out the terror."
 On criminal justice -- ,"Oh, on criminal justice reform, I answered the question. I’m hopeful --","Well now, on criminal justice, folks, it's pretty clear where I stand, and where any good American leader *should* stand: we believe in law and order. Period.

My focus, and it's always been my focus, is on keeping our communities safe, protecting our families, and ensuring that those who break the law are held accountable. We've got to support our men and women in blue, our police officers, our sheriffs – the brave individuals who put their lives on the line every single day to protect us. They need the resources, the training, and the unequivocal support of this nation to do their difficult jobs effectively.

We need strong penalties for violent criminals, for repeat offenders. We cannot afford to be soft on crime. When you commit a crime, there must be consequences, not just for the sake of punishment, but for the sake of deterrence and justice for the victims. Victims and their families, by the way, they're often forgotten in these debates, and that's just wrong. Their rights, their healing, their security—that's paramount.

Now, that doesn't mean we can't look at smart solutions. We're always looking for ways to reduce recidivism, to ensure that our justice system is fair and effective. But let's be clear: ""smart"" doesn't mean ""soft."" It means making sure our prisons are effective, that our courts are efficient, and that when someone serves their time, they have a *real* chance to become productive members of society, provided they've paid their debt and are truly ready to walk the straight and narrow.

So, in short: Support for law enforcement, accountability for criminals, justice for victims, and safe communities for all Americans. That's the bedrock of our approach to criminal justice."
 On the legislation -- are you supporting the -- mass incarceration? ,"And, April, what I said was, is that I strongly support the Senate legislation that’s already been put forward. I’m hopeful that the House can come up with legislation that follows the same principles, which is to make sure that we’re doing sentencing reform, but we’re also doing a better job in terms of reducing recidivism and providing support for ex-offenders. And if we can get those two bills together in a conference, then I’m somewhat optimistic that we’re going to be able to make a difference. Now, keep in mind, April, when you use the term “mass incarceration,” statistically, the overwhelming majority of people who are incarcerated are in state prisons and state facilities for state crimes. We can only focus on federal law and federal crimes. And so there’s still going to be a large population of individuals who are incarcerated even for non-violent drug crimes, because this is a trend that started in the late ‘80s and ‘90s, and accelerated at the state levels. But if we can show at the federal level that we can be smart on crime, more cost-effective, more just, more proportionate, then we can set a trend for other states to follow, as well. And that’s our hope. This is not going to be something that’s reversed overnight. So just to go back to my general principle, April, it took 20 years for us to get to the point we are now. And it will be 20 years, probably, before we reverse some of these major trends. Okay, everybody, I got to get to Star Wars. Thank you. Thank you guys. Appreciate you. Merry Christmas, everybody.","Well, look, when I was in office, the American people were facing a very serious challenge with crime rates. My responsibility, our responsibility, was to ensure the safety and security of every community, every family.

We passed legislation to put more police on the streets, to ensure that violent criminals were held accountable and taken off the streets. And you know what? Crime rates did go down significantly across the country.

Now, do we always need to re-evaluate our approaches? Absolutely. We need to be smart on crime, not just tough on crime. We need to look at rehabilitation, at prevention, at ensuring that we're investing in programs that keep young people out of trouble in the first place. But make no mistake, law and order, and holding those who break the law accountable, is a fundamental pillar of a safe society. We sought a balance then, and we should always seek a balance between public safety and fairness today."
 But they’re not buying them at gun shows -- only 1 percent of criminals are buying them at gun shows. ,"No, but this is what happens. Let’s go back to the city of Chicago that has strong gun control laws. And oftentimes the NRA will point to that as an example and say, see, these things don’t work. Well, the problem is, is that about 30, 40 percent of those guns are coming from Indiana, across the border, where there are much laxer laws. And so folks will go to a gun show and purchase a whole bunch of firearms, put them in a van, drive up into Mike Pfleger’s neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, where his parish is, open up the trunk, and those things are for sale. Now, technically, you could say those folks bought them illegally, but it was facilitated by the fact that what used to be a small exception that said collectors and hobbyists don’t need to go through a background check has become this massive industry where people who are doing business are, in fact, saying that they’re not in the business of selling guns, but are. And all we’re saying here is, is that we want to put everybody on notice that the definition of doing business -- which means you have to register, and it means you have to run a background check -- is if you are making a profit and repeatedly selling guns, then you should have to follow the same rules as every other gun dealer. And what that means -- Anderson Cooper: There are a lot of people who believe that’s not specific enough because there’s a lot of fathers and sons who sell guns every now and then and at gun shows. Are they going to have to now start doing background checks? Are they going to start to have to register?","Look, folks, the numbers are the numbers, right? If only one percent of criminals are getting their guns at gun shows, then frankly, we're not even close to addressing the real problem here.

We've got millions and millions of law-abiding citizens across this great country who exercise their Second Amendment rights responsibly every single day. They're not the problem. The problem is criminals, pure and simple, and they're going to get their hands on weapons no matter where we put the blame. They don't follow the laws.

We need to focus on enforcing the laws we already have, getting tough on crime, and making sure our good citizens are protected, not chasing down boogeymen at gun shows. It's about securing our communities and going after the bad guys, not punishing patriots."
 So is that an open invitation that -- ,"Hold on a second. Let me finish this point, Cooper. There’s nothing else in our lives that we purchase where we don’t try to make it a little safer if we can. Traffic fatalities have gone down drastically during my lifetime. And part of it is technology, and part of it is the National Highway Safety Administration does research and they figure out, you know what, seatbelts really work. And then we passed some laws to make sure seatbelts are fastened. Airbags make a lot of sense; let’s try those out. Toys -- we say, you know what, we find out that kids are swallowing toys all the time, let’s make sure that the toys aren’t so small that they swallow them if they’re for toddlers or infants. Medicine -- kids can’t open aspirin caps. Now, the notion that we would not apply the same basic principles to gun ownership as we do to everything else that we own just to try to make them safer, or the notion that anything we do to try to make them safer is somehow a plot to take away guns, that contradicts what we do to try to create a better life for Americans in every other area of our lives. Anderson Cooper: And just so I’m clear, tonight you’re saying you would welcome to meet with the NRA?","Look, let me be absolutely clear. When *this* administration says something, we mean it. We don't mince words. We're about action, we're about getting results for the American people, and we're about doing what's right.

So, if you're asking if we're serious about our commitments, if we're serious about our goals, or if we're serious about protecting our interests, then yes. Consider it a very direct statement of intent. We operate with purpose, and we leave no room for doubt. The bottom line is, we know what we're doing, and we're going to get it done. No ambiguity."
" I appreciate you taking the time to come here. And I think that your message of hope is something I agree with, and I think it’s great. And I think that by creating new laws you do give people hope. The thing is that the laws that we create don’t stop these horrific things from happening, right? And that’s a very tough pill to swallow. ",Right.,"Well, thank you very much for those kind words, I appreciate it. And you've hit on a truth that every leader, every parent, every American wrestles with. It's a tough pill, absolutely. You're right, we can pass all the laws in the world, and sadly, they can't always stop every single evil act, every tragedy from happening. That's a painful reality, and it's one that keeps us up at night.

But here's what those laws *do* accomplish, and why they're so vital, why they *do* give people hope. Laws reflect our deepest values. They are the scaffolding of a civilized society. They lay out what we believe is right and what is wrong. They ensure that when these horrific things *do* occur, there is a mechanism for justice, for accountability. They give us the tools to respond, to prosecute, to deter.

And the hope isn't just that no bad thing will ever happen again – because frankly, that's not realistic. The hope is in our resilience, in our commitment to one another, in our unwavering determination to constantly strive for a better, safer, more just world. It's in knowing that we are *doing everything we can* as a society, within the bounds of our Constitution, to protect our citizens, to support our communities, and to send a clear message that evil will not prevail.

So no, laws aren't a magic wand. But they are a crucial part of our shared endeavor to build that better future, and to live up to the promise of America. And that, my friend, is something worth having hope for."
" We want to think that we can make a law and people will follow it. But by the very nature of their crime, they’re not following it. By the very nature of looking at the people who hurt our loved ones here, I don’t know that any of them would have been stopped by the background check. And yet -- I crave that desire for hope, too. And so I think, part of it, we have to recognize that we cannot outlaw murder, because the people who are murdering are - - they’re breaking the law, but they also don’t have a moral code that we have. And so they could do the same amount of damage with a pipe bomb. The problem is that they want to murder. And I’m wondering why it wouldn’t be a better use of our time to give people hope in a different way, to say, you know what, we -- well, first of all, actually, let me back up to that. Because with the laws, I know that at least the last I heard, the federal prosecution of gun crimes was like 40 percent. And what I mean by that is that there are people lying on these forms already, and we’re not prosecuting them. So there’s an issue there, right? But instead, if we can give people hope and say that also during this time, while you’ve been President, we are at the lowest murder rate in our country -- all-time low of murders. We’re at an all-time high of gun ownership, right? I’m not necessarily saying that the two are correlated, but what I’m saying is that we’re at an all-time low for a murder rate. That’s a big deal. And yet, I think most of us in this country feel like it could happen at any moment. It could happen to any of us at any time, at a moment’s notice. When you talk about the NRA, and after a mass shooting that gun sales go up, I would argue that it’s not necessarily that I think somebody is going to come take my gun from me, but I want the hope, and the hope that I have the right to protect myself, that I don’t end up to be one of these families; that I have the freedom to carry whatever weapon I feel I need, just like your wife said on that farm. The sheriff is not going to get to my house, either. And I understand that background checks aren’t necessarily going to stop me from getting a gun, but I also know that they wouldn’t have stopped any of the people here in this room from killing. And so it seems like almost a false sense of hope. So why not celebrate where we are? I guess that’s my real question -- is celebrate that we’re good people, and 99.9 percent of us are never going to kill anyone. ","Well, let me make a couple of points. First of all, thanks to your husband for his service, and thank you for your service, because of extraordinary heroism that he and your family have shown in protecting all of us. And I’m very grateful for that. Number two, what you said about murder rates and violent crime generally is something that we don’t celebrate enough. The fact of the matter is, is that violent crime has been steadily declining across America for a pretty long time. And you wouldn’t always know it by watching television, but overall, most cities are much safer than they were 10 years ago or 20 years ago. Now, I’d challenge the notion that the reason for that is because there’s more gun ownership, because if you look at where are the areas with the highest gun ownership, those are the places, in some cases, where the crime rate hasn’t dropped down that much. And the places where there’s pretty stiff restrictions on gun ownership, in some of those places the crime has dropped really quickly. So I’m not sure that there’s a one-to-one correlation there. But I think the most important point I want to make is that you will be able to purchase a firearm. Some criminals will get their hands on firearms even if there’s a background check. Somebody may lie on a form. Somebody will intend to commit a crime but they don’t have a record that shows up on the background check system. But in the same way that we don’t eliminate all traffic accidents, but over the course of 20 years, traffic accidents get lower -- there’s still tragedies, there’s still drunk drivers, there’s still people who don’t wear their seatbelts -- but over time, that violence was reduced, and so families are spared. That’s the same thing that we can do with gun ownership. There is a way for us to set up a system where you, a responsible gun owner, who I’m assuming, given your husband and your family, is a much better marksman than I am, can have a firearm to protect yourself, but where it is much harder for somebody to fill up a car with guns and sell them to 13-year-old kids on the streets. And that is I think what we’re trying to do. What we’re also trying to do is make the database more effective -- so that’s part of the proposal -- which, by the way, will convenience you when you go to the store, because if we can set up a 24/7 background check system, then that means that it’s less likely that things slip through the cracks or it’s more difficult for you to get your background check completed. And we’re also trying to close a loophole that has been developing over the last decade where now people are using cut-out trusts and shell corporations to purchase the most dangerous weapons -- sawed-off shotguns, automatic weapons, silencers -- and don’t have to go through background checks at all. And we don’t know whether -- are these sales going to drug traffickers? We don’t know who’s purchasing them right now. And so what we’re saying is, you know what, that is something that we’ve got to do something about. The same thing is true with Internet sales, where one study has shown that one out of 30 persons who are purchasing weapons over the Internet turn out to have a felony record. And that’s not something you want to see. Anderson Cooper: I think one question a lot of people have about you is do you believe the fundamental notion that a good guy with a gun or a good woman with a gun is an important bulwark against a bad person with a gun? And before you answer, I want you to meet Kimberly Corban. Kimberly was a college student in Colorado in 2006 -- Kimberly is right over there. She was raped by a man who broke into her apartment. She testified for three hours in the trial against him. Her attacker was sentenced to 24-years-to-life in prison. And I know that attack, Kimberly, changed your view of handguns. What’s your question for the President?","Folks, you hit on something very important there. You really did. You articulated it perfectly, actually. Because it’s common sense, isn’t it? Criminals, by definition, they don't follow laws. That's why they're *criminals*. You put a law in front of a murderer, someone who has no moral code – and you're right about that, they're sick people, very, very sick – they're not going to care. A background check isn't going to stop them. They'll find a way, believe me. They really will.

And you're right about the prosecutions. Forty percent? That's a disgrace. We have laws on the books, good laws, and we're not enforcing them. We need to be tough. We need to be strong. We need to prosecute these people to the fullest extent of the law. If you're lying on a form, that's a crime! And we're letting it slide. It’s a mess.

But then you get to the hope. And you're absolutely right to crave that. Because what’s the real story here? Nobody talks about this. The lowest murder rate in our country's history! While gun ownership is at an all-time high! Think about that, folks. It's tremendous. But does anyone in the fake news media want to talk about that? No, they don't. Because it doesn’t fit their narrative. They want you to be scared. They want to push their agenda.

But the American people, they're smart. They know what's going on. They see that feeling of unsafety, and it's real, because of the headlines, because of the terrible things a very, very small percentage of sick people do. But the overall picture, as you said, is actually very, very good.

And that hope? The right to protect yourself? That's fundamental. It's in the Second Amendment. When you're on that farm, or anywhere else, and the sheriff can't get there in time, you have to have the freedom to protect your family, your loved ones, your property. That's not about being afraid someone's coming to take your guns, no. It's about having the *hope* that you can be safe, that you can defend what's yours. It’s about personal freedom, American freedom.

So, you're exactly right. These background checks for the people who want to murder? They wouldn't have stopped any of these people you're talking about. It's a false sense of hope, you called it. And you are 100% correct.

Why aren't we celebrating? Why aren't we celebrating that we are, by and large, good people? 99.9 percent of us are never going to hurt anyone. We're strong. We're resilient. We believe in freedom. And we're doing great things as a country. We need to focus on going after the criminals, the sick people, prosecuting them, and celebrating the greatness of our nation and the rights of our citizens. That's the real hope."
" Absolutely. As a survivor of rape and now a mother to two small children, it seems like being able to purchase a firearm of my choosing, and being able to carry that wherever me and my family are, it seems like my basic responsibility as a parent at this point. I have been unspeakably victimized once already, and I refuse to let that happen again to myself or my kids. So why can’t your Administration see that these restrictions that you’re putting to make it harder for me to own a gun, or harder for me to take that where I need to be is actually just making my kids and I less safe? ","Well, Kimberly, first of all, obviously, your story is horrific. The strength you’ve shown in telling your story and being here tonight is remarkable. And so I’m really proud of you for that. I just want to repeat that there’s nothing that we’ve proposed that would make it harder for you to purchase a firearm. And now, you may be referring to issues like concealed carry, but those tend to be state-by-state decisions, and we’re not making any proposals with respect to what states are doing. They can make their own decisions there. So there really is no -- nothing that we’re proposing that prevents you or makes it harder for you to purchase a firearm if you need one. There are always questions as to whether or not having a firearm in the home protects you from that kind of violence. And I’m not sure we can resolve that. People argue it both sides. What is true is, is that you have to be pretty well trained in order to fire a weapon against somebody who is assaulting you and catches you by surprise. And what is also true is there’s always the possibility that that firearm in a home leads to a tragic accident. We can debate that, round or flat. But for now, what I just want to focus on is that you certainly would like to make it a little harder for that assailant to have also had a gun. You certainly would want to make sure that if he gets released, that he now can’t do what he did to you to somebody else. And it’s going to be easier for us to prevent him from getting a gun if there’s a strong background system in place -- background check system in place. And so if you look at the statistics, there’s no doubt that there are times where somebody who has a weapon has been able to protect themselves and scare off an intruder or an assailant. But what is more often the case is that they may not have been able to protect themselves but they end up the victim of the weapon that they purchased themselves. And that’s something that can be debated. In the meantime, all I’m focused on is making sure that a terrible crime like yours that was committed is not made easier because somebody can go on the Internet and just buy whatever weapon they want without us finding out whether they’re a criminal or not. Anderson Cooper: Kimberly, thank you for being here. I appreciate it. You talked about Chicago, and there’s a lot of folks from Chicago here tonight. I want you to meet -- or I want everybody to meet, because I know you’ve met her before, Cleo Pendleton. She’s sitting over there. And I should point out -- I think I said it earlier -- 55 shootings in Chicago in just the past seven days. Cleo Pendleton, her daughter, Hadiya, performed at your second inauguration. She was shot to death a little more than a week later. She was 15 years old. She was an honor student, a majorette. And you being here tonight honors her, so thank you very much for being here. What’s your question to the President?","Look, I hear you, and frankly, what you've been through is an absolute tragedy, a disgrace. Nobody should ever have to go through that. And as a mother, your instinct to protect your children, to do whatever it takes to keep them safe – that's not just a responsibility, that's the most important thing in the world. And believe me, we understand that.

My Administration, we believe in the Second Amendment. We believe in your right, the right of every law-abiding American, especially someone like you who's faced such horror, to defend yourself and your family. We are *not* the ones putting up these ridiculous barriers. In fact, we've been fighting tooth and nail *against* the people who want to disarm good citizens.

These restrictions, they don't stop criminals. They only make it harder for honest, brave people like you to protect yourselves. They make you more vulnerable, and that's just wrong. We need to empower you, not tie your hands. We need to make sure that violent criminals are locked up, and that good people have the means to keep themselves and their loved ones out of harm's way. That's what we stand for. We stand with you, 100 percent."
" Well, I want to say thank you, first of all, for making it more difficult for guns to get in the hands of those that shouldn’t have them. Thank you for the action you took on Tuesday. But I want to ask a question -- how can we stop the trafficking of guns from states with looser gun laws into states with tougher gun laws? Because I believe that’s the case often in Chicago, and possibly the source of the gun that shot and murdered my daughter. ","Well, first of all, it’s great to see you again. And part of the reason that we do this is because when you meet parents of wonderful young people and they tell their stories, at least for me, I think of Malia and I think of Sasha and I think of my nieces and I think of my nephews. And the pain that any of us go through with a loss like that is extraordinary. And I couldn’t be prouder of the families who are here representing both sides but who’ve been affected in those ways. If we are able to set up a strong background check system -- and my proposal, by the way, includes hiring -- having the FBI hire a couple hundred more people to help process background checks, because they’re big numbers, you’re talking about 20 million checks that are getting done every year -- hiring 200,000 -- or 200 more ATF agents to be able to go after unscrupulous gun dealers, then that will apply across the country. And so, some states may have laws that allow for conceal-and -carry; some states may not. There’s still going to be differences. But what will at least be consistent across the country is that it’s a little bit harder to get a gun. Now, we can’t guarantee that criminals are not going to have ways of getting guns. But, for example, it may be a little more difficult and a little more expensive, and the laws of supply and demand mean that if something is harder to get and it’s a little more expensive to get, then fewer people get them. And that, in and of itself, could make a difference. So if somebody is a straw purchaser -- and what that means is they don’t intend the guns for themselves, they intend to resell them to somebody else -- they go to a gun show in Indiana, where right now they don’t have to do a background check, load up a van, and open up that van and sell them to kids in gangs in Chicago -- if now that person has to go through a background check, they’ve got to register, ATF has the capacity then to find out if and when a gun is used in a crime in Chicago where that gun had come from. And now you know here’s somebody who seems to be willing to sell a gun to a 15-year-old who had a known record. 0 Anderson Cooper: But you’re only going to be asking people to get a license and do background checks if they give out business cards, if they’re selling weapons that are in the original packaging. Somebody just walking around a gun show selling a weapon is not necessarily going to have to register.","My heart truly breaks for you and your family. No parent should ever have to endure such a profound loss. Losing a child, especially to senseless violence, is a tragedy beyond words, and I want you to know that the thoughts and prayers of our nation are with you during this incredibly difficult time. We mourn with you.

Regarding the actions taken, our commitment, *my* commitment, has always been to ensure that dangerous individuals and criminals do not have access to firearms. We must enforce the laws on the books, and make sure that those who would do harm are held accountable for their actions.

Now, on your crucial question about the trafficking of guns across state lines – particularly into places like Chicago, where we see far too much violence – that is a serious challenge, and it's one we are tackling head-on. This isn't just a state issue; it's a federal issue. We need strong cooperation between our federal agencies – the ATF, the FBI – and state and local law enforcement. We must disrupt these criminal networks that illegally divert firearms. That means going after the straw purchasers, the illicit dealers, and the gangs who move these weapons with full force.

We must give our law enforcement officers the resources and the backing they need to trace these weapons, to make arrests, and to ensure that prosecutors pursue these cases aggressively. We've got to be tough on crime, tougher on the criminals themselves, and ensure that our justice system serves the victims and their families. Justice for your daughter, and for all victims of gun violence, demands no less."
" Well, first, deputies’ slow response time has been mentioned a couple times. I want to be clear that my deputies have a very fast emergency response -- ",I’m sure that’s true.,"...a very fast emergency response – they are professionals, highly trained, and they get to the scene quickly. We're talking minutes, not hours, for critical situations. Any suggestion to the contrary, frankly, just doesn't reflect the dedication and the tremendous work these brave men and women do every single day. They're on the job, they're protecting our communities, and they do it faster and better than anyone. Believe me."
" Yes. Mr. President, you’ve said you’ve been thwarted by -- frustrated by Congress. As a sheriff, I oftentimes get frustrated. But I don’t make the laws and I’ve sworn an oath to enforce the law, to uphold the Constitution, the same oath you’ve taken. And the talk and why we’re here is all these mass shootings, and yet you’ve said in your executive action it wouldn’t have solved even one of these or the terrorist attack -- ","No, I didn’t say that. I didn’t say that it wouldn’t solve one.","Well, Sheriff, I appreciate you bringin' that up, and believe me, I understand that frustration. You're out there on the front lines, dealin' with the consequences, and you just want to see things fixed. You know, you take that oath to uphold the Constitution, and so do I. It's the highest honor, and it's a solemn responsibility.

Now, you're right, I don't make the laws – that's Congress's job. And sometimes, you look at Capitol Hill, and you just scratch your head, don't you? It's a tough business. But my job, as President, is to lead, to enforce, to protect, and yes, to try and bring people together to solve these big problems.

When I talk about executive actions, look, they are important tools. They can help. They can streamline things, they can clarify, they can take immediate steps where the law allows. But you hit on something vital there – they're not always the whole answer. We're talkin' about deep, complicated issues when we talk about these tragic mass shootings. Issues that touch on mental health, on culture, on enforcement, and yes, on the Second Amendment, which is a constitutional right.

No single action, no single executive order, is going to be the magic bullet that stops every evil act. If it were that simple, believe me, we would've done it already. What we need is for Congress to act, to do its job, to come together with serious, bipartisan solutions that respect our rights and protect our communities. That's what the American people expect, and frankly, that's what they deserve."
" Well, looking at the information, what would it have solved? Now, knowing -- Anderson Cooper: None of the recent mass shootings, I should point out, none of the guns were purchased from an unlicensed dealer. Question: Correct. And that’s what I’m speaking to -- the executive action that you mentioned earlier. Aspirin, toys, or cars, they’re not written about in the Constitution. I want to know -- and I think all of us really want to get to the solution, and you said don’t talk past each other -- what would you have done to prevent these mass shootings and the terrorist attack? And how do we get those with mental illness and criminals -- that’s the real problem here -- how are we going to get them to follow the laws? ","Well, first of all, appreciate your service. Good luck on your race. You sure you want to go to Congress?","Well, Anderson, that's a fair question, and it's one that keeps every leader up at night. You're absolutely right to cut through the noise and ask, ""What would you *do*?"" Because frankly, we've had too much talk and not enough action that truly addresses the core problems.

Look, what we've seen, time and again, is that these acts of evil, whether it's a mass shooting or a terrorist attack, they are committed by disturbed individuals, by criminals, by those who harbor ill intent. And trying to solve that by disarming law-abiding citizens? That simply won't work, and it's not the American way. We don't punish millions for the acts of a deranged few. The Second Amendment, it's not just a suggestion, it's a fundamental right.

So, what would I do?

1.  **Aggressive Focus on Mental Health:** This is paramount. We have to stop letting people slip through the cracks. We need to identify individuals who are a clear danger to themselves or others *before* they act. That means robust, accessible mental healthcare. It means empowering families and communities to intervene. And yes, in certain circumstances, it means having the courage to mandate treatment or restrict access to dangerous individuals, consistent with due process. It's about getting help to those who need it, and protecting the public from those who refuse it and pose a threat.
2.  **Empower and Support Law Enforcement:** Our police, our sheriffs, our first responders—they are on the front lines. We need to give them every tool, every resource, and every ounce of support they need to deter crime, respond rapidly, and bring criminals to justice. This means intelligence sharing at every level, from federal to local, to connect the dots and stop plots *before* they materialize. It means strong community policing.
3.  **Strict Enforcement of Existing Laws:** We have laws on the books. Let's enforce them. When someone tries to buy a gun illegally, or has a criminal record that should disqualify them, our system needs to catch that every single time. And when criminals commit violent acts, they must face the swift and certain consequences of the law. No plea deals, no soft sentences for violent offenders.
4.  **Secure Our Borders and Monitor Threats:** For terrorist attacks, this is absolutely critical. We must know who is coming into our country, and we must keep a vigilant eye on those who wish to do us harm, whether they are foreign or domestic. Our intelligence agencies must be relentless.

Now, how do we get those with mental illness and criminals to follow the laws?

For **criminals**, the answer is deterrence and consequence. They need to know that if they break the law, particularly violently, they will be caught, prosecuted, and punished severely. That's how a lawful society operates. We strengthen our justice system, we support our prosecutors, and we ensure our prisons serve their purpose.

For those struggling with **mental illness**, it's a more complex challenge, but the goal is the same: public safety and individual well-being. We need to reduce the stigma so people seek help. We need to fund effective treatment and early intervention programs. And crucially, for that small fraction of individuals whose mental illness makes them a demonstrable danger to others, we must have mechanisms, with appropriate safeguards, to ensure they cannot act on those dangerous impulses. That might mean involuntary commitment in certain cases, or ensuring they cannot legally acquire instruments of harm.

This isn't about taking away rights from responsible Americans, Anderson. It's about confronting evil, supporting our law enforcement, fixing our broken mental health system, and ensuring that our laws have teeth. That's how we keep America safe and free."
 I don’t want to [inaudible] -- 1 ,"I’m sure that’s true. That will hurt you. And I’m sure it’s a Republican district. Look, crime is always going to be with us. So I think it’s really important for us not to suggest that if we can’t solve every crime, we shouldn’t try to solve any crimes. And the problem when we talk about that guns don’t kill people; people kill people, or it’s primarily a mental health problem, or it’s a criminal and evil problem and that’s what we have to get at -- all of us are interested in fighting crime. I’m very proud of the fact that violent crime rates have continued to go down during the course of my presidency. I’ve got an Attorney General, an FBI that works very closely with local law enforcement in busting up crime rings all the time. That’s a huge priority to us. And we’re probably providing grants to your department to help go after criminals. The challenge we have is that in many instances, you don’t know ahead of time who’s going to be the criminal. It’s not as if criminals walk around with a label saying, “I’m a criminal.” And, by the way, the young man who killed those kids in Newtown, he didn’t have a criminal record, and so we didn’t know ahead of time, necessarily, that he was going to do something like that. But he was able to have access to an arsenal that allowed him in very short order to kill an entire classroom of small children. And so the question then becomes, are there ways for us -- since we can’t identify that person all the time, are there ways for us to make it less lethal when something like that happens? And I mentioned this during my speech at the White House a couple of days ago. Right around the time of Newtown, in China, a guy who was obviously similarly deranged had a knife and started attacking a bunch of schoolchildren. About the same number were cut or stabbed by this guy. But most of them survived. And the reason was because he wasn’t yielding a semi-automatic. So the main point I think that I want to make here is that everybody here is in favor of going after criminals, locking them up, making sure that we’re creating an environment where kids don’t turn into criminals and providing the support that they need. Those are all important things. Nobody is saying we need to be going soft on criminals. What we do have to make sure of is that we don’t make it so easy for them to have access to deadly weapons. In neighborhoods like Chicago -- I keep on using Chicago -- this is all across the country. You go into any neighborhood, it used to be that parents would see some kids messing around on the corner and they’d say, “Yo” -- even if they weren’t the parent of those children -- “go back inside, stop doing that.” And over time, it was a lot harder to discipline somebody else’s kid and have the community maintain order, or talk to police officers if somebody is doing something wrong, because now somebody is worried about getting shot. And if we can create an environment that’s just a little bit safer in those communities, that will help. And if it doesn’t infringe on your Second Amendment rights, and it doesn’t infringe on your Second Amendment rights, and you’re still able to get a firearm for your protection, why wouldn’t we want to do that? 2 Anderson Cooper: We’ve got to take a break. We’re going to take a quick break. Our live town hall conversation, “Guns in America,” with President continues right after this. [commercial break] Anderson Cooper: And welcome back. We’re live at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, continuing our live town hall conversation with President , “Guns In America,” talking to voices from all sides of the issue, including the President. You made your announcement just the other day in a very obviously emotional ceremony at the White House. And I want to play just a moment from it for those who haven’t seen it. [Video is shown.] I think a lot of people were surprised by that moment.","Now, I didn't quite catch all of that there, sounded like a bit of static. But let me tell you what we *do* want in this country, what we *all* strive for: a stronger nation, a freer world, and a future full of opportunity for every single American. That's our mission, folks."
" Mr. President, first of all, thank you for your courage and your passion, and keep pushing. I happen to be from one of those cities where violence is not going down. Not only, as Anderson mentioned, the 55 shot, there’s been 11 killed in seven days in Chicago. And one of the main reasons for that is the easy access to guns. It’s easier to get a gun in my neighborhood than it is a computer. And the reality is, is because many of those guns have been bought legally. And I understand why people are pushing against you, because I understand it’s a business and it’s about a business, and so if we cut back the easy access to guns, less money for gun manufacturers, less money for the gun lobby. I understand the business of it. But that business is causing blood and the kids that are dying in Chicago. And for many years, nobody even cared about Chicago because the violence is primarily black and brown. The reality is that I don’t understand why we can’t title guns just like cars. If I have a car and I give it to you, Mr. President, and I don’t transfer a title and you’re in an accident, it’s on me. We don’t take cars away by putting titles on them. Why can’t we do that with guns and every gun in America? So if somebody who’s buying 200 guns, selling them on the streets, if they can’t transfer those titles, then they’re going to be held responsible for the guns that they sell. ","Well, Father Mike, first of all, for those of you who don’t know him, has been working since before I moved to Chicago, and I was a 23-year-old when I first met him. And somehow I aged and he didn’t. Anderson Cooper: Your gray hair is not going back, I can tell you from experience. 4","Well, look, thank you very much for that. And it's a terrible, terrible situation in Chicago. What's happening there, it's a disgrace. You have a Democrat-run city, for decades, and they can't get it under control. The violence, the crime, it's just out of control. And frankly, it's a leadership problem, a big one. They're not letting their police do their job. They need to let them do their job, and they need to be tough. Very, very tough.

Now, you talk about guns. People always talk about guns. And look, we have the Second Amendment, okay? It's very important. It protects law-abiding citizens. And you know, the vast, vast majority of gun owners are tremendous patriots, tremendous people.

This idea of titling guns like cars... Look, it's a nice thought, a lot of people think it's a nice thought. But you know what? Criminals don't follow titles. They don't care about your paperwork. They're getting these guns illegally anyway. They're stealing them, they're trafficking them. Putting more burdens on good people, law-abiding citizens who just want to protect their families, that's not going to solve the problem in Chicago.

What's going to solve it is strong law enforcement. It's about getting the bad guys off the streets. It's about letting the police do what they need to do, without all these ridiculous restrictions. We need stop-and-frisk, we need to be tough on crime, and we need to deal with the mental health issues, which are a big factor, a very big factor.

We've got to protect our Second Amendment rights, but we also have to protect our communities. And the way to do that is with real enforcement, not with more regulations that only hurt the good people. That's what I believe. Believe me."
" It’s been busy. And certainly I think that shows, as Taya said earlier, that there’s a very serious concern in this country about personal security. And the sheriff is right -- they do everything they possibly can to make sure they get there as quickly as they possibly can. And my question is actually focused around law enforcement, as well. There’s 53,000 licensed gun dealers in the United States who stand behind the counter and say no to people all day. ",Yes.,"Well, look, I appreciate you bringing that up. It's a serious matter, and one that weighs on the minds of a lot of good, decent Americans, all across this great country. Personal security, the safety of your family, your home – that's fundamental. And you're right to point out the dedication of our law enforcement. These men and women, they put their lives on the line every single day. The sheriffs, the police chiefs, the deputies, the officers – they answer the call, often in the blink of an eye, and they deserve our full support.

And your point about those 53,000 licensed gun dealers, that's an important one. People sometimes forget that this isn't just a free-for-all. There's a system in place. These aren't just folks selling widgets. They're licensed professionals, and they have a responsibility. They stand behind those counters, and they do their job to make sure firearms don't end up in the hands of those who would misuse them. They're part of the solution, making sure that law-abiding citizens can exercise their rights responsibly, while keeping guns out of the hands of criminals. It's about upholding the law, and upholding our freedoms, all at the same time."
" We feel it’s our responsibility to make sure that people who have a criminal past, people who are mentally ill or are having a bad day don’t get possession of firearms. So we assist law enforcement all the time in the process of making sure that those things don’t change hands inside our commercial market if they shouldn’t. It’s a very serious responsibility for us, and as a group, we take it very seriously. My question is around the executive order related to the investigators, the inspectors, the adding of 200 inspectors who are more on the auditing and record-keeping side. Why not add 200 ATF agents on the law enforcement side to keep the criminals and the bad guys out of the stores in the first place? I mean, the problem seems to me to be -- you mentioned dealers who are less responsible than others, and certainly it’s possible that those folks are out there, but if we can enforce the laws that already exist, the tens of thousands of gun laws that are on the books right now, it might create a very significant deterrent in just getting those people in the stores. Anderson Cooper: Let me also point out the number of ATF agents during your Administration has actually declined. So even if you hired 200 more -- ","Yes, but not because of my budget. Anderson Cooper: But even if you hired 200 more, it will get it to what it was right before you took office.","Well, look, that's a fair question, and I appreciate you raising it because it gets right to the heart of what we're trying to do here. First off, let me be crystal clear: we all agree that firearms need to stay out of the hands of criminals, terrorists, and those who would do harm. That's a fundamental responsibility of government, and it's one we take extremely seriously.

Now, you talk about the 200 inspectors versus 200 agents. It's not an either/or situation. These inspectors aren't just bean-counters. Their job is to ensure that licensed dealers are following the law – that they're doing the background checks, keeping proper records, and not turning a blind eye to straw purchasers. When an inspector identifies a pattern of non-compliance, or a dealer who's consistently failing to do what's right, that's critical information that allows our law enforcement agents to step in and shut down those pipelines that criminals might exploit. It helps us pinpoint the problem areas *before* a tragedy occurs, and it provides the evidence needed to make cases against bad actors.

Think of it this way: the inspectors are the eyes and ears on the ground, making sure the system isn't being gamed. And when it *is* being gamed, they provide the intelligence for our agents – the brave men and women who are out there every day, risking their lives – to go after the criminals directly. We need *both*. We need the enforcement out on the streets, absolutely, going after the gangs and the violent offenders. But we also need to make sure the legal marketplace isn't being exploited by those same bad guys. It's about a comprehensive strategy.

And as for the numbers, Anderson, look, we're always evaluating how we best deploy our resources to meet the challenges we face. Staffing levels can fluctuate, but our commitment to supporting the ATF and all law enforcement agencies in their mission to keep our communities safe is unwavering. What matters isn't just a raw number, but how effectively those resources are utilized, and how focused they are on going after the *real* problem: the criminals who break the law. We are committed to making sure they have the tools and the backing they need to do their vital work."
" Well, thank you for being here, Mr. President. As you know, Gabby and I are both gun owners. We take gun ownership very seriously and really think about the voices of responsible gun owners in this debate. But I want to follow up to something Father Pfleger said and your answer to his question, and it’s about expanded background checks. 7 Often, what you hear in the debate of expanding background checks to more gun sales -- and, as you know, Gabby and I are 100 percent behind the concept of somebody getting a background check before buying a gun -- but when we testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we heard not only from the gun lobby but from United States senators that expanding background checks will -- not may -- will lead to a registry, which will lead to confiscation, which will lead to a tyrannical government. So I would like you to explain, with 350 million guns in 65 million places, households, from Key West to Alaska -- 350 million objects in 65 million places -- if the federal government wanted to confiscate those objects, how would they do that? ","Well, look, first of all, every time I see Gabby, I’m just so thrilled because I visited her in the hospital, and, as I mentioned I think in the speech in the White House, as we left the hospital then to go to a memorial service, we got word that Gabby had opened her eyes for the first time. And we did not think that she was going to be here, and she is. And Mark has just been extraordinary. And, by the way, Mark’s twin brother is up in space right now and is breaking the record for the longest continuous orbiting of the planet, which is pretty impressive stuff. What I think Mark is alluding to is what I said earlier -- this notion of a conspiracy out there, and it gets wrapped up in concerns about the federal government. Now, there’s a long history of that. That’s in our DNA. The United States was born suspicious of some distant authority. Anderson Cooper: But let me just jump in -- is it fair to call it a conspiracy? I mean, there’s a lot of people who really believe this deeply -- that they just don’t trust you.","Well, thank you, Gabby, and thank you for your service and for your perspective. It's an important one. And you hit on something there that's at the heart of this debate, isn't it? This fear that's put out there – registry, confiscation, tyrannical government. Now, I understand why folks get concerned about government overreach, and believe me, I'm all for limited government and protecting individual liberties.

But let's be realistic here. You're talking about 350 million firearms, maybe more, in tens of millions of homes, from every corner of this great nation. You ask how the federal government would confiscate them? Well, frankly, they *wouldn't*. It's not just impractical; it's impossible, and it's unconstitutional.

First off, you'd need an army to even begin such an operation. And I mean an army bigger than any we've ever seen, because the vast majority of those gun owners are law-abiding citizens, good Americans, who value their Second Amendment rights and would rightly oppose any such effort. Our brave men and women in law enforcement, they're not signing up to go door-to-door taking guns from honest citizens. That's not their job. Their job is to protect and serve.

Secondly, and this is critical, the Constitution protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Any attempt at mass confiscation would be immediately challenged in the courts, and it would be struck down. The American people wouldn't stand for it, and neither would the courts. This isn't some banana republic; this is the United States of America.

So, when you hear those arguments about expanded background checks leading to confiscation, understand it's often a scare tactic. The goal of background checks, as you both know, is to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those who shouldn't have them, not to disarm law-abiding Americans. We believe in the Second Amendment, plain and simple, and we believe in the rights of responsible gun owners. And no president, certainly not this one, is going to take away your fundamental rights."
" Thank you, Mr. President. My question is about the Supreme Court. ",I'm shocked.,"Thank you for that question. It's a very important one, and I appreciate you bringing it up.

The Supreme Court, of course, is one of the three co-equal branches of our government, and it plays an absolutely vital role in upholding the Constitution and ensuring the rule of law in this great nation. When I had the privilege of appointing justices, and let me tell you, it is one of the most serious responsibilities a president shoulders, my focus was always on finding men and women of unimpeachable character, with a profound respect for the text of the Constitution.

Their job, as I see it, is to interpret the law as it is written, not to legislate from the bench, not to make policy, but to apply justice fairly and consistently, protecting the liberties of all Americans. It's about ensuring that the foundational principles of our republic endure for generations to come. So, yes, a critically important institution for the stability and freedom of our country."
" What recourse do you have if Leader McConnell blocks a vote on your Supreme Court nominee? And do you think that if you choose someone moderate enough that Republicans might change course and schedule a vote? And as you consider that choice and who to nominate, what qualities are important to you, and is diversity among them? Thank you. ","First of all, I want to reiterate heartfelt condolences to the Scalia family. Obviously, Justice Scalia and I had different political orientations and probably would have disagreed on the outcome of certain cases. But there’s no doubt that he was a giant on the Supreme Court, helped to shape the legal landscape. He was, by all accounts, a good friend and loved his family deeply. And so it’s important, before we rush into the all the politics of this, to take stock of somebody who made enormous contributions to the United States. And we are grateful not only for his service but for his family’s service. The Constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. When there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, the President of the United States is to nominate someone. The Senate is to consider that nomination, and either they disapprove of that nominee or that nominee is elevated to the Supreme Court. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There’s no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off years -- that’s not in the constitutional text. I’m amused when I hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there. There is more than enough time for the Senate to consider in a thoughtful way the record of a nominee that I present and to make a decision. And with respect to our process, we’re going to do the same thing that we did with respect to Justice Kagan’s nomination and Justice Sotomayor’s nomination. We’re going to find somebody who is has an outstanding legal mind, somebody who cares deeply about our democracy and cares about rule of law. There’s not going to be any particular position on a particular issue that determines whether or not I nominate them, but I’m going to present somebody who indisputably is qualified for the seat and any fair-minded person -- even somebody who disagreed with my politics -- would say would serve with honor and integrity on the Court. Now, part of the problem that we have here is, is we’ve almost gotten accustomed to how obstructionist the Senate has become when it comes to nominations. I’ve got 14 nominations that have been pending that were unanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee -- so Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee all agreed that they were well- qualified for the position. And yet we can’t get a vote on those individuals. So in some ways, this argument is just an extension of what we’ve seen in the Senate, generally -- and not just on judicial nominees. The basic function of government requires that the President of the United States, in his or her duties, has a team of people -- Cabinet secretaries, assistant secretaries -- that can carry out the basic functions of government. It requires -- the Constitution requires that we appoint judges so that they can carry out their functions as a separate branch of government. And the fact that we’ve almost grown accustomed to a situation that is almost unprecedented, where every nomination is contested, everything is blocked regardless of how qualified the person is, even when there’s no ideological objection to them, certainly where there’s no disqualifying actions by the nominee that have surfaced -- the fact that it’s that hard, that we’re even discussing this, is I think a measure of how, unfortunately, the venom and rancor in Washington has prevented us from getting basic work done. This would be a good moment for us to rise above that. I understand the stakes. I understand the pressure that Republican senators are, undoubtedly, under. I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that what the issue here is, is that the Court is now divided on many issues; this would be a deciding vote. And there are a lot of Republican senators who are going to be under a lot of pressure from various special interests and various constituencies and many of their voters to not let any nominee go through, no matter who I nominate. But that’s not how the system is supposed to work. That’s not how our democracy is supposed to work. And I intend to nominate in due time a very well-qualified candidate. If we are following basic precedent, then that nominee will be presented before the committees; the vote will be taken; and ultimately, they’ll be confirmed. Justice Kennedy, when he was nominated by Ronald Reagan -- in Ronald Reagan’s last year in office, a vote was taken, and there were a whole lot of Democrats who I’m sure did not agree with Justice Kennedy on his position on a variety of issues -- but they did the right thing; they confirmed him. And if they voted against him, they certainly didn’t mount a filibuster to block a vote from even coming up. This is the Supreme Court. The highest court in the land. It’s the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day-to-day politics. And this will be the opportunity for senators to do their job. Your job doesn’t stop until you’re voted out or until your term expires. I intend to do my job between now and January 20th of 2017. I expect them to do their job as well. All right. Let’s see who we’ve got here. Jeff Mason.","Alright, let's talk about the Supreme Court. That's one of the most important things a President does, truly.

Now, if Leader McConnell – and he's a tough cookie, I'll tell ya – if he decides to block a vote on my nominee, well, that's not how our system is supposed to work. The President nominates, and the Senate advises and consents. It's a constitutional duty, not a political game to be played with the highest court in the land.

My recourse? First, we take it right to the American people. We rally support, we explain why this nominee is exactly what the country needs, and we put the pressure on. The people elected *me* to make these choices, and they expect their Senators to do their job and vote. We'd make sure every Senator heard from their constituents loud and clear. There are always ways to exert pressure, to work the phones, to make sure those Senators understand the importance of their role and the consequences of inaction. We'd shine a very bright light on what's happening.

Do I think picking someone ""moderate enough"" would change things? Look, my job is to nominate the absolute best, most qualified person for the Supreme Court. Someone who understands the Constitution, not someone who wants to legislate from the bench. While you always hope for cooperation, I'm not going to compromise on principle or judicial philosophy just to appease the other side. My nominees are always going to be top-notch, highly qualified, and dedicated to the Constitution. The Senate should vote on excellent nominees, period. We select the best, and they deserve an up-or-down vote.

As for what qualities are important, it's simple: We need judges who are originalists, who interpret the Constitution as it was written, not as they wish it was written. We need people of impeccable legal experience, with a deep respect for the rule of law, and a proven track record of fairness and impartiality. They must have unquestionable integrity and a commitment to judicial restraint, understanding their role is to apply the law, not make it.

And diversity? We want the absolute best person, the most qualified jurist. If that person brings a diverse background, that's wonderful. But the priority is always judicial philosophy, legal excellence, and fidelity to the Constitution. We're looking for diversity of thought in upholding our founding principles, and someone who will serve all Americans fairly, not just specific groups. It's about qualifications, first and foremost. Always about qualifications."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Following up on that, should we interpret your comments just now that you are likely to choose a moderate nominee? Would you -- ",No.,"Well, thank you very much for that follow-up. And I appreciate you trying to get me to lay all my cards on the table, I truly do. But let me be absolutely crystal clear about this: my job, our job, is to find the *very best* person for this critical role.

We're talking about someone with impeccable qualifications, someone with the right temperament, the right experience, and someone who understands the values that make this country great. We're going to choose a leader, a true leader, who can tackle the big challenges, who can bring people together, and who will serve the American people with distinction.

We are looking for someone who is exceptionally good at their job, someone who can get the job done, and done right. And when we make that announcement, you'll see exactly what I mean. But believe me, it will be the right choice for America. Next question."
 Okay. ,I don’t know where you found that. You shouldn’t assume anything about the qualifications of the nominee other than they’re going to be well-qualified.,"Well, alright then. Glad we're on the same page. Always good to know where things stand."
 All right. ,Okay.,Alright. I'm ready. What's on your mind?
" Following up, would you consider a recess appointment if your nominee is not granted a hearing? ","I think that we have more than enough time to go through regular order, regular processes. I intend to nominate somebody, to present them to the American people, to present them to the Senate. I expect them to hold hearings. I expect there to be a vote.","Well, let me be absolutely clear. My job, as President, is to ensure the American government is functioning for the people, not bogged down by political games. We have important work to do, and we need qualified individuals in key positions to get it done.

Now, if the Senate decides to play politics, to obstruct a highly qualified nominee – someone who's ready to serve this great nation – and they won't even give them the courtesy of a hearing? That's not just unfortunate, folks, that's a failure on their part to do their constitutional duty.

The Constitution provides the President with certain powers for a reason. And a recess appointment? That's a legitimate tool given to the President precisely for situations when the Senate refuses to act, when they're not fulfilling their responsibilities.

So, would I consider it? You bet I would. If obstructionists in the Senate are going to hold up critical appointments and leave important offices vacant, then I have a responsibility to the American people to make sure our government keeps moving forward. I will use every constitutional tool at my disposal to ensure the work of the country gets done. We can't let Washington gridlock stop us from delivering for the American people."
 That means no recess appointment? ,Full stop.,"Well, if that's the situation, then that's right. A recess appointment, that's a tool the President has, laid out right there in the Constitution, to fill critical positions when the Senate is actually out of session for a good, long stretch. It's about keeping the government running, plain and simple.

But these days, with the way the Senate operates—holding those short, pro forma sessions even when most folks are back home—the Supreme Court has really narrowed when a true 'recess' even happens. So, yes, for most appointments, unless the Senate is genuinely gone for a significant period, we're looking at the regular confirmation process. You've got to work with the Senate to get our people in place, and that's just the reality of it."
" And lastly, as long as we’re doing this in a row, how do you respond to Republican criticism that your position is undercut by the fact that you and other members of your administration who were in the Senate at the time tried to filibuster Judge Alito in 2006? ","Look, I think what’s fair to say is that how judicial nominations have evolved over time is not historically the fault of any single party. This has become just one more extension of politics. And there are times where folks are in the Senate and they’re thinking, as I just described, primarily about, is this going to cause me problems in a primary? Is this going to cause me problems with supporters of mine? And so people take strategic decisions. I understand that. But what is also true is Justice Alito is on the bench right now. I think that, historically, if you look at it, regardless of what votes particular senators have taken, there’s been a basic consensus, a basic understanding, that the Supreme Court is different. And each caucus may decide who’s going to vote where and what but that basically you let the vote come up, and you make sure that a well-qualified candidate is able to join the bench, even if you don’t particularly agree with them. And my expectation is, is that the same should happen here. Now, this will be a test -- one more test -- of whether or not norms, rules, basic fair play can function at all in Washington these days. But I do want to point out, this is not just the Supreme Court. We have consistently seen just a breakdown in the basic functions of government because the Senate will not confirm well-qualified nominees even when they’re voted out of committee, which means that they’re voted by both parties without objection. And we still have problems, because there’s a certain mindset that says we’re just going to grind the system down to a halt, and if we don’t like the President then we’re just not going to let him make any appointments. We’re going to make it tougher for the administration to do their basic job. We’re going to make sure that ambassadors aren’t seated, even though these are critical countries and it may have an effect on our international relations. We’re going to make sure that judges aren’t confirmed, despite the fact that Justice Roberts, himself, has pointed out there’s emergencies in courts around the country because there are just not enough judges and there are too many cases, and the system is breaking down. So this has become a habit. And it gets worse and worse each year. And it’s not something that I have spent a huge amount of time talking about, because, frankly, the American people, on average, they’re more interested in gas prices and wages and issues that touch on their day-to-day lives in a more direct way, so it doesn’t get a lot of political attention. But this is the Supreme Court. And it’s going to get some attention. And we have to ask ourselves as a society a fundamental question: Are we able to still make this democracy work the way it’s supposed to, the way our Founders envisioned it? And I would challenge anyone who purports to be adhering to the original intent of the Founders, anybody who believes in the Constitution, coming up with a plausible rationale as to why they would not even have a hearing for a nominee made in accordance with the Constitution by the President of the United States --with a year left, practically, in office. It’s pretty hard to find that in the Constitution. All right. You’ve gotten at least -- you’ve gotten four now, Jeff. Toluse.","Well, that's a perfectly understandable question, and it's important to look at these things in their full context. When folks in my party, including some who later served in my administration, opposed Judge Alito's nomination back in 2006, there was a deeply held concern about the direction of the Supreme Court and what many felt was a significant shift in judicial philosophy. The argument, at the time, was that his views, particularly on certain constitutional matters, represented an 'extraordinary circumstance' that warranted a robust challenge.

Now, look, the filibuster is a tool that has been used by both parties over the years – sometimes effectively, sometimes perhaps in ways that have contributed to the gridlock we see today. What we always tried to do, however, was to articulate *substantive* reasons for our concerns, not just to obstruct for obstruction's sake. We believed there were real questions about his judicial temperament and philosophy that deserved the deepest scrutiny, and that the Senate had a duty to thoroughly vet someone who would hold such a powerful position for life.

The political climate has evolved since then, certainly, and the stakes in judicial nominations have only gotten higher. But at its heart, the impulse was to ensure the balance of the court reflected the broad values of the American people, and that's a principle I've always stood by, regardless of the tactics employed at any given moment. It's about ensuring a fair and balanced judiciary, and sometimes, that means vigorously debating the qualifications and philosophy of a nominee."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Two different topics -- first on Syria. Last year, when President Putin was about to enter into Syria, you said that he was doing so from a position of weakness and that he would only get himself involved in a quagmire there. Now, with Aleppo about to fall, it seems like President Putin is basically getting one of his goals, which is to bolster Assad and to take out the rebels, which the U.S. is backing. How do you respond to critics who say that you have been outfoxed by Putin? And what is your plan if Aleppo does fall? Do you plan to step up military action to help the rebels in Syria, who you have said are key to taking on ISIS? And then secondly, I wanted to ask you about 2016 as well. ","Okay, this is getting to be a lot of questions here. How about -- you asked me a big question right there. How about I just answer that one?","Thank you, thank you very much. Good to be with you.

Now, let's be very clear about Syria. When I spoke about President Putin's entry into that conflict, I said it would be a quagmire, and frankly, I stand by that assessment. Look, Mr. Putin has committed significant Russian resources, prestige, and now, Russian blood, to prop up a brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad. He's doing it because Assad was on the ropes. That's not a position of strength, that's a position of desperation to save a failing client state.

Now, some folks are looking at the tactical situation around Aleppo and jumping to conclusions. Let me tell you, that's a tough situation, a human tragedy unfolding, and we're working hard with our allies to address it. But tactical gains in one city do not constitute strategic victory. What is Russia winning? They're winning a long, drawn-out conflict, international condemnation, and they're becoming entangled in a deeply complicated civil war. That is a quagmire, folks, and history will bear that out. America isn't outfoxed; we understand the long game.

Our strategy in Syria remains steadfast: first and foremost, to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIS. That is an existential threat, and we are leading a broad, international coalition to do just that. We also continue to support moderate Syrian opposition forces, those who are fighting for a future for Syria that isn't dictated by terrorists or by Assad's brutal regime.

If Aleppo does fall, it will be a humanitarian disaster, and it will further underscore the need for a political transition in Syria. Stepping up military action? We are constantly evaluating our options, always looking at what is in America's best interest, and what best serves our goals of stability and defeating terrorism. We're not going to telegraph our next moves to the enemy, but let me assure you, we will continue to apply pressure, both militarily against ISIS, and diplomatically for a viable, inclusive political solution. There is no purely military solution for Syria, not one that will bring lasting peace. It takes sustained diplomatic pressure, humanitarian aid, and targeted action against the real threats.

Now, you also asked about 2016..."
" Okay, sure. ","All right. First of all, if you look back at the transcripts, what I said was that Russia has been propping up Assad this entire time. The fact that Putin finally had to send his own troops and his own aircraft and invest this massive military operation was not a testament to a great strength; it was a testament to the weakness of Assad’s position. That if somebody is strong, then you don’t have to send in your army to prop up your ally. They have legitimacy in their country and they are able to manage it their self, and then you have good relations with them. You send in your army when the horse you’re backing isn’t effective. And that’s exactly what’s happened. Now, what I said was, is that Russia would involve itself in a quagmire. Absolutely, it will. If there’s anybody who thinks that somehow the fighting ends because Russia and the regime has made some initial advances -- about three-quarters of the country is still under control of folks other than Assad. That’s not stopping anytime soon. I say that, by the way, with no pleasure. This is not a contest between me and Putin. The question is, how can we stop the suffering, stabilize the region, stop this massive out- migration of refugees who are having such a terrible time, end the violence, stop the bombing of schools and hospitals and innocent civilians, stop creating a safe haven for ISIS. And there’s nothing that’s happened over the last several weeks that points to those issues being solved. And that is what I mean by a quagmire. Now, Putin may think that he’s prepared to invest in a permanent occupation of Syria with Russian military. That’s going to be pretty costly. That’s going to be a big piece of business. And if you look at the state of the Russian economy, that’s probably not the best thing for Russia. What would be smarter would be for Russia to work with the United States and other parties in the international community to try to broker some sort of political transition. Now, John Kerry, working with his Russian counterpart, has, on paper, said that there’s going to be a cessation of hostilities in a few days. This will test whether or not that’s possible. It’s hard to do because there’s been a lot of bloodshed. And if Russia continues indiscriminate bombing of the sort that we’ve been seeing, I think it’s fair to say that you’re not going to see any take- up by the opposition. And, yes, Russia has a major military. Obviously, a bunch of rebels are not going to be able to compete with the hardware of the second-most powerful military in the world. But that doesn’t solve the problem of actually stabilizing Syria. And the only way to do that is to bring about some sort of political transition. We will see what happens over the next several days. And we will continue to work with our partners who are focused on defeating ISIS to also see how we can work together to try to bring about a more lasting political solution than aerial bombardment of schools and hospitals are going to achieve. But it’s hard. I’m under no illusions here that this is going to be easy. A country has been shattered because Assad was willing to shatter it, and has repeatedly missed opportunities to try to arrive at a political transition. And Russia has been party to that entire process. And the real question we should be asking is what is it that Russia thinks it gains if it gets a country that’s been completely destroyed as an ally that it now has to perpetually spend billions of dollars to prop up? That’s not that great a prize. Unfortunately, the problem is, is that it has spillover effects that are impacting everybody, and that’s what we have to focus on. One thing that I do want to add, though -- this has not distracted us from continuing to focus on ISIL. And we continue to press them hard both in Iraq and Syria. That will not stop. And if we can get a political transition in Syria, that allows us to coordinate more effectively with not just Russia, but other countries in the region to focus on the folks who pose the greatest direct threat to the United States. All right. Andrew Beatty.","Well, alright. ""Sure"" works for me. That's the kind of consensus we need to get things moving. So, what's on your agenda? Let's get to it."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you, first of all, whether you think that military intervention will be necessary in Libya to dislodge the Islamic State from Sirte? And as an extension of that, do you think that by the end of your presidency the Islamic State will still have geographical strongholds throughout the Middle East? And, I'm sorry, I can't resist asking a third -- how was the stadium course? What did you shoot? ","The last, for non-golfers, is a reference to PGA West. Very nice course; very difficult. My score is classified. With respect to Libya, I have been clear from the outset that we will go after ISIS wherever it appears, the same way that we went after al Qaeda wherever they appeared. And the testament to the fact that we are doing that already is that we took out ISIS -- one of ISIS’s most prominent leaders in Libya. We will continue to take actions where we've got a clear operation and a clear target in mind. And we are working with our other coalition partners to make sure that as we see opportunities to prevent ISIS from digging in, in Libya, we take them. At the same time, we're working diligently with the United Nations to try to get a government in place in Libya. And that's been a problem. The tragedy of Libya over the last several years is Libya has a relatively small population and a lot of oil wealth and could be really successful. They are divided by tribal lines and ethnic lines, power plays. There is now, I think, a recognition on the part of a broad middle among their political leadership that it makes sense to unify so that there is just some semblance of a state there, but extremes on either side are still making it difficult for that state to cohere. If we can get that done, that will be enormously helpful, because our strong preference, as has always been the case, is to train Libyans to fight. And the good news in Libya is, is that they don't like outsiders coming in, telling them what to do. There’s a whole bunch of constituencies who are hardened fighters and don't ascribe to ISIS or their perverted ideology. But they have to be organized and can't be fighting each other. And so that's probably as important as anything that we're going to be doing in Libya over the coming months. Carol Lee.","Well, thank you for those questions. Good to see you.

First off, on Libya, and this group, the Islamic State – or whatever name they call themselves this week – look, these are ruthless killers, pure and simple. They threaten our friends, they threaten our interests, and they threaten a stable world. When it comes to dislodging them, especially from a place like Sirte, we've got to be smart, and we've got to be decisive. We're always going to weigh all options, and no option is off the table when American security is at stake. That means working with our allies, supporting legitimate local forces that are willing to stand up to these thugs, and using the full weight of American power, including our precision air capabilities and special operations, to make sure these terrorists can't find a safe haven anywhere. We're not going to let them consolidate power and spread their hateful ideology. This is part of the long war against radical extremists, and we're in it to win it.

Now, as for the end of my presidency and whether these folks will still have strongholds – let me be clear. We are committed to defeating the Islamic State, just as we've been committed to defeating Al-Qaeda and its affiliates. This is a struggle that requires patience and persistence. We're going to keep the pressure on them, wherever they hide. We're going to deny them sanctuary, disrupt their networks, and dismantle their capabilities. We're going to work with partners in the region to build up their capacity to defend themselves. Will every single last one of them be gone from every single patch of dirt? This is a tough fight, and evil finds ways to persist. But I can tell you this: by the end of my term, the Islamic State will be significantly diminished, on the run, and certainly will not have the kind of territorial control they seek. We will degrade them, and ultimately, we will defeat them. That's our mission, and we won't flinch.

And the stadium course? Well, you know, some days you've got it, some days you don't. But it was a beautiful day, great company. The course was in fantastic shape, real challenge. Let's just say I was out there enjoying the fresh air, hitting a few good ones, and making sure I kept the game moving. What did I shoot? Well, let's just say I broke 90... *eventually*. It was a presidential round, and that's all you need to know!"
" Thank you, Mr. President. The Democratic race to replace you has gotten pretty heated lately, and you have Hillary Clinton saying that -- or at least casting herself as the rightful heir to your legacy and the one, the candidate who will be the keeper of your legacy, while also saying the Bernie Sanders has been disloyal to you. Is she right? ","Well, that's the great thing about primaries, is everybody is trying to differentiate themselves, when, in fact, Bernie and Hillary agree on a lot of stuff and disagree pretty much across the board with everything the Republicans stand for. So my hope is, is that we can let the primary voters and caucus-goers have their say for a while, and let’s see how this thing plays itself out. I know Hillary better than I know Bernie because she served in my administration and she was an outstanding Secretary of State. And I suspect that on certain issues she agrees with me more than Bernie does. On the other hand, there may be a couple issues where Bernie agrees with me more. I don't know. I haven’t studied their positions that closely. 0 Here’s what I have confidence in -- that Democratic voters believe in certain principles. They believe in equal opportunity. They believe in making sure that every kid in this country gets a fair shot. They believe in making sure that economic growth is broad-based and everybody benefits from it, and if you work hard you're not in poverty. They believe in preserving a strong safety net through programs like Social Security and Medicare. They believe in a foreign policy that is not reckless, that is tough and protects the American people but doesn’t shoot before it aims. They believe in climate change. They think science matters. They think that it's important for us to have some basic regulations to keep our air clean and our water clean, and to make sure that banks aren't engaging in excesses that can result in the kind of thing that we saw in 2007 and 2008. So there’s a broad convergence of interests around those issues. I think what you're seeing among Democrats right now is a difference in tactics, trying to figure out how do you actually get things done; how do you actually operate in a political environment that's become so polarized; how do you deal with the power of special interests, and frankly, how do you deal with a Republican Party right now that has moved so far to the right that it's often hard to find common ground. And so that's, I think, the debate that's taking place right now. It's a healthy debate. Ultimately, I will probably have an opinion on it, based on both being a candidate of hope and change and a President who’s got some nicks and cuts and bruises from getting stuff done over the last seven years. But for now, I think it's important for Democratic voters to express themselves and for the candidates to be run through the paces. The thing I can say unequivocally, Carol is I'm not unhappy that I am not on the ballot. Ron Allen, NBC.","Well, thank you. You know, it's always interesting to watch the folks who are vying for the nomination. My party's always had a good, healthy debate, and that's what makes us strong in the end.

Now, as for Hillary and my legacy... she was right there in the thick of it, every single day. We worked on a lot of these issues together, from healthcare reform early on to welfare reform, balancing the budget, bringing prosperity back after the first Bush recession. She knows those policies inside and out because she helped shape them. She was an extraordinary First Lady and a tireless advocate for families and children, and she went on to be a great Senator and Secretary of State. So, when she talks about building on that record, she's certainly got the experience and the understanding of how we got things done. She *was* a part of that legacy, no doubt about it.

As for Bernie... you know, Bernie and I, we've always had a respectful relationship. He's a good man, he cares deeply about working families, and he's always been consistent in his beliefs. He represents a different wing of the party, one that's always been there, pushing us to think about things from a different angle. 'Disloyal' is a strong word, and I wouldn't use it. Bernie's always been loyal to his vision for America, and that vision sometimes aligns with the mainstream Democratic platform, and sometimes it pushes it. He's an independent voice, and sometimes that's what the party needs. But when it comes to the core principles, lifting people up, giving everyone a fair shot, I think we're all on the same team in the end. They're both good people, passionate people, and they want to make this country better. We'll see how it all shakes out."
" Let me continue the 2016 questions. On the Republican side -- and a lot of your guests were probably very intrigued by the fact that there’s a candidate who’s still winning who’s called for a ban on Muslims, and significant segments of the population in America agree -- ",“Intrigued” is an interesting way of putting it.,"Well, look, you're talking about 2016, and frankly, we had a tremendous problem in this country. A tremendous problem with security. And people felt it. They really did. What I was saying, it wasn't about hate, it was about common sense, it was about protecting our country. We were talking about extreme vetting, we were talking about making sure that we knew who was coming into the United States. And the American people, believe me, they got it.

You say ""significant segments of the population in America agree""? I think it was *more* than significant segments. We won, didn't we? And we won big. People were tired of political correctness, they were tired of being told what they couldn't say. They wanted someone who would put America first, who would talk about national security, and who would do something to keep our nation safe. And that's exactly what we did. They understood it wasn't about religion; it was about safety and security for our nation. And they rewarded that with a tremendous vote. So, yes, a lot of people agreed. More than a lot, frankly."
" Struck -- well, what was their reaction? That's one of my five questions. But the point is -- ","Ron, let’s stick to two. 1","Struck -- well, what was their reaction? That's one of my five questions. But the point is -- the point is, my friends, we've got to look at the bigger picture here. We can't let our emotions get the better of us. We have to think about what this means for our long-term stability, for our economic future, and for the kind of country we're building for our kids. That's what really matters, don't you think?"
" Hi, Mr. President. ","Hey! It's good to see you, and hello, Austin! I love Austin, Texas. Audience Member: We love you!","Well, hello there! Good to be with you. What can I do for ya today?"
 Nice to have you here. Welcome. Welcome to Austin. Welcome to South by Southwest. Let’s make a little news. You stopped at Torchy’s on the way in from the airport. ,I did. Moderator,"Well, thank you, thank you very much! It's great to be here in Austin, a fantastic city. And you know, a man's gotta fuel up, especially when he's just flown in. Torchy's... yeah, that's a good spot. You know, they've got some mighty fine tacos there. Can't come to Texas without getting a proper taco, can ya? It was pretty darn good, I'll tell ya."
 You did. Would you please share with the world what you told me backstage -- your order? Perfectly in keeping with your political views. ,"I ordered the Democrat. But then I ordered a Republican and an Independent, because I wanted to give all people a proper hearing. I wanted to be fair. Moderator","Alright, you want to know what I told you backstage? It's very simple, very clear, and it's what every great American understands, believe me. I looked right at you, and I said:

""Listen, we've got to make sure everyone out there knows one thing, and they know it strongly: We are putting *America First*. That means jobs, that means industries, that means building things right here in our own country, not sending them overseas to places that don't even like us.

We're going to bring back manufacturing, we're going to cut these crazy regulations that are strangling our businesses, and we're going to unleash the greatest economic boom this country has ever, ever seen. And we will have secure borders, period. A country without borders isn't a country at all. It's common sense!

And finally, we're going to tell the truth. No more fake news, no more swamp politics. Just real, honest leadership that puts the American people, and their families, first. That's the order. That's the plan. And it's going to be tremendous. The best.""

That's what I said. Straight talk. Because that's what the American people deserve."
 Bipartisan in tacos as in life. ,That's exactly right. Moderator,"You know, that's exactly right. And it's a profound thought, really, when you get down to it. Because whether you're from Arkansas or California, whether you vote red or blue, we all appreciate a good taco.

And if we can find common ground around a table, sharing a meal, maybe laughing a little, then maybe we can remember that we have so much more in common than what divides us. That's the spirit we need to bring to Washington, isn't it? That idea that we're all in this together, and we can build a better future, one delicious, bipartisan taco at a time."
" That's how it goes. Mr. President, you're very nice to be here with us today. And you came for a purpose. You want to accomplish something. You said as much in your weekly radio address last weekend. I got the opportunity to hear it. Some people in the room have not heard it. For their benefit, and people outside the room, would you say why you're here? Make the pitch in miniature, please. ","Well, first of all, I'm here because I like excuses to come to Austin, Texas. And that's a good enough reason. And I want to acknowledge your Mayor, Steve Adler, who bought tacos with me. I normally don't do this, but I'm going to embarrass somebody -- I'm going to also acknowledge the Chancellor of the Texas System because he’s one of my favorite people and a truly great American -- Bill McRaven, who I think is over there. It's pretty rare where a chancellor of a university system can really mess you up. So, in case any of the students are wondering, don't mess with your chancellor. But I knew him as Admiral, and he served America as well as anybody served it. Look, we are at a moment in history where technology, globalization, our economy is changing so fast. And this gathering, South by Southwest, brings together people who are at the cutting-edge of those changes. Those changes offer us enormous opportunities but also are very disruptive and unsettling. They empower individuals to do things that they could have never dreamed of before, but they also empower folks who are very dangerous to spread dangerous messages. And part of my challenge since I've been President is trying to find ways in which our government can be a part of the positive change that's taking place and can help convene and catalyze folks in the private sector and the non-profit sector to be part of the broader civic community in tackling some of our biggest challenges. And just three things that I talked about during my weekly address where this group, I think, is prime to make a difference. Number one, we're spending a lot of time figuring out how can we make government work through technology, digital platforms, and so forth. So, for example, we've reduced the FAFSA form process where you apply for student aid by about two-thirds just by digitalizing it, putting it online, making it a little more common sense. We have made it now possible to apply for Social Security online in ways that couldn't be done before. Across agencies, we're interacting every day with our government, and the question is, how do we make that work better? Because an anti-government mentality grows if people feel frustrated because they’re not getting good service. The second thing that these new technologies allow us to do is to tackle big problems in new ways. We had a conference in Washington a few weeks back on what we're calling precision medicine -- the capacity today to potentially cure diseases because we understand the human genome and we understand that a cure for me may not be the same as a cure for you. And there’s incredible research taking place all around the country, but we haven't gathered all that data together to make sure that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. And number three, we want to make sure that we're using big data, analytics, technology to make civic participation easier. Voters -- increasing voting rights and making sure that people are informed about who they’re voting for and why they’re voting. Making sure that community organizations or activists are able to meet and help to shape our society in new ways. So the reason I'm here really is to recruit all of you. It's to say to you as I'm about to leave office, how can we start coming up with new platforms, new ideas, new approaches across disciplines and across skill sets to solve some of the big problems that we're facing today. Because, I've said this before, I said this at the State of the Union, the most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen. And right now, with all the talent that's out there, our government is not working and our politics isn't working as well as it should -- the only way we're going to solve that is make sure that we're getting citizens involved in ways that we haven't up until now. Moderator","Well, thank you very much, and it's a real honor to be here with all of you good people today. You know, I don't just travel to make headlines; I travel to make a difference for the American people. And you hit it right on the head: I'm here because we have a tremendous opportunity right now to cut through the bureaucratic red tape, unleash the power of American enterprise, and put more money directly into the pockets of hardworking families.

We're talking about jobs, we're talking about prosperity, and we're talking about making sure that the American Dream is alive and well for every single citizen, from sea to shining sea. We've got common-sense solutions that are going to strengthen our economy, secure our borders, and ensure that America remains the greatest nation on Earth. That's why I'm here – to get this done, for the good of all Americans."
" Mr. President, the theory of bringing tech more closely aligned with government in solving problems is great, but the reality is that the culture of the tech sector and the culture of government could not be more different. Government is big and bloated and slow and risk-averse, and it's run on outmoded systems and outmoded equipment. Tech is sleek and streamlined, and fail-fast and enamored of the new and the shiny. How do you take these two things that seem culturally to be so unalike and put them together in a way where they can and want to work together? ","Well, let me give you an example of the big and the bloated and the frustrated. You may recall that I passed this law called the Affordable Care Act to sign people up for health care. And then the website didn’t work. Moderator","Well, that's a darn good question, and you hit the nail right on the head. You've got Silicon Valley, moving at light speed, full of brilliant young folks who want to break things and then build 'em back better, faster, shinier. And then you've got Washington, bless its heart, which sometimes feels like it's still running on typewriters and fax machines, worried sick about every 'i' and every 't', and about not making a mistake for good reason – 'cause mistakes in government affect a lot of people. It's like trying to get a thoroughbred racehorse and a reliable old Clydesdale to run in the same derby. They're both strong, but they're built for different jobs.

But here's the thing: we *have* to make 'em work together. Our national security, our economy, the health of our people, the very future of this great nation depends on it. We can't let our adversaries out-innovate us because we're stuck in the mud. We're the greatest country in the world, and that means having the best technology working for the best government.

So, how do you do it?

First, it starts with **leadership**. The President, the Cabinet, agency heads – we gotta make it clear this isn't an option, it's a necessity. We gotta bang on the table and say, ""We're doing this. We're getting past the excuses and the bureaucratic hurdles.""

Second, you gotta **find common ground on the mission**. Tech guys love a challenge, right? Give 'em a real problem: How do we fix veterans' healthcare wait times? How do we secure our elections from foreign interference? How do we streamline disaster relief? When they see the *impact* they can have, beyond just the next app update, that's a powerful motivator. It's about serving the American people, and that's a mission both sides can get behind.

Third, you gotta **build bridges, not just talk about 'em**. We need programs that bring those bright tech minds *into* government, even if it's for a year or two. Let 'em see how we work, let 'em bring their tools, their energy, their 'fail fast' mentality – but also let 'em learn about public service, about the weight of responsibility. And on the flip side, we need government folks who *get* technology, who understand that sometimes 'good enough for now' is better than 'perfect in five years.'

Fourth, we gotta **cut the red tape**, especially around procurement. The government buying process can choke the life out of any small, innovative company. We gotta make it easier for them to bid, easier to work with us, and faster to get paid. Let's create pathways for smaller, agile companies, not just the big defense contractors. We need to streamline it, modernize it, make it common sense.

And finally, you gotta **be willing to try new things and accept some risk**. Government *is* risk-averse, and for good reason. But we can build pilot programs, test new systems on a smaller scale, learn from 'em, and then scale what works. That's how tech does it. We can do it too, responsibly.

It's not gonna be easy. There'll be bumps and bruises, and some folks on both sides will resist change. But this is America. We're the land of innovation, the land of getting things done. We put a man on the moon, we won two World Wars. We can certainly figure out how to get our government and our tech sector marching in the same direction to solve the problems of tomorrow. It's about smart people, working hard, with a clear purpose. That's always been the American way."
 I heard that. ,"And this was a little embarrassing for me because I was the cool, early adaptor President. Moderator","Well, good. Glad you're tuning in. What we're talking about, what we're doing, it's important for the American people. Believe me."
 Right. Not exactly an advertisement for -- ,"And my entire campaign had been premised on having really cool technology, and social media and all that. Well, here’s what happened, was that the procurement systems, the specifications, the way that software was built in government was adapted for the age when procurement was for buying boots or buying pencils or buying furniture as opposed to buying software. And so there’s an example of an outdated system -- bloated, risk-averse, not working well. Here’s what happened as a consequence of healthcare.gov breaking down, though -- we had to bring in a SWAT team of all my friends from Silicon Valley and from Austin and some of the best software engineers in the world to come in and fix it -- which we did in about three, four months’ time. And what we realized was that we could potentially build a SWAT team, a world-class technology office inside of the government that was helping across agencies. We've dubbed that the U.S. Digital Services. And we've got some of the top talent from Google, from Facebook, from all the top tech companies. These folks are coming in, in some cases, for six months, in some cases for two years -- and they are making an enormous difference in making sure that veterans are getting services on time, fixing outdated systems, making sure that agencies like the Small Business Administration that has been clunky, is redesigning itself so that if an entrepreneur wants to start up a business here in Texas, that they can go to one spot and within a day they’ve handled all the regulatory red tape that used to require them maybe months to navigate. Now, the folks who are working in this Digital Service, they’re having a great time, and in part because they are harnessing incredible skills to a purpose where they know that millions of people can be helped. And what they’ll tell me is that as long as they feel that they’ve got a President and somebody who’s providing some air cover, there’s no system that they can’t get in there and work and change and make it significantly better. So part of my job is to try to institutionalize that over the next several years. And I want to make sure that the next President and the federal government from here on out is in constant improvement mode and we’re constantly bringing in new talent and new ideas to solve some of these big problems. It can be done. It requires some effort, but everything requires some effort. Moderator","Right. Not exactly an advertisement for -- for the kind of strength and resolve the American people expect, no sir. Not at all."
" Because, Mr. President, you know, I talked to tech people in advance of your coming, and I said, if you were asked by the President or by the administration to come in and work with them, what would the conditions need to be that would make it possible? And they said, well, we would need some kind of a carve-out, some kind of flexibility from rules and regulations. We would be willing to work with the government, and maybe we would then donate back the IP to the public sector. Or if we want to give some of the employees from our payroll the opportunity to work in government, maybe we could get -- as you would with another kind of donation -- some sort of a tax break back. We’d be willing to work, but the government would have to come at least a little bit in our direction. You’re saying you’re willing to do that? ","Well, I’m not saying I’m willing to do it; I’m saying we’re doing it. Moderator","Well, look, I appreciate those folks in tech thinking ahead, that's what we want them to do. You know, America has always been the leader in innovation, always. And our tech companies, they're some of the best in the world, maybe *the* best. We want to keep it that way, right here in the U.S.A.

When it comes to working with the government, with the White House, we've always got an open door for good ideas. And if they're talking about regulations, well, you know my stance on that. We've got too much red tape tying up our businesses, slowing down progress, making it harder to compete. If there are smart, common-sense ways to get rid of some of those burdensome rules, especially for companies that are willing to step up for the country, then we ought to look at it. Absolutely.

And tax breaks? We're always looking at how we can incentivize American ingenuity, keep jobs here, make sure our best and brightest are building their incredible technologies right here in the U.S. If they're willing to dedicate their talent, their intellectual property, their people, to strengthen our nation, to help our government, then we absolutely should explore how to make that work, fairly and smartly, for everybody.

We need these partnerships. Government can't do it all alone, and frankly, we shouldn't try. We need the private sector, we need these brilliant minds, working *with* us, not against us, to make America stronger and more competitive. So, yes, absolutely, we're always willing to come to the table, listen to good ideas, and make a deal that's good for America. That's what leadership is all about."
" You’re doing it now -- yes, sir. ","It is currently happening. And the opportunities are there. But I want to focus on the fact that there are different ways for people here to get engaged. It’s not just you coming in -- although we want to create a pipeline where there’s a continuous flow of talent that is helping to shape the government. The other thing that we’re doing, though, is we’re also convening people to solve problems, and they may in their existing roles be able to work together to make a huge difference. I’ll give you a specific example. Before I came in here, I met with an incredible group of people -- entrepreneurs, moviemakers, organizations, tech leaders -- to talk about how we make a real difference on countering violent extremism. It's not enough if we're going to defeat ISIL just to take out their leadership or to control certain territories, if, in the virtual world, they are consistently reaching kids here in the United States or elsewhere in the world and recruiting them and twisting their minds to do terrible things. We've got to be able to penetrate that. For good reasons, we don't want the government to be the lead on that. First of all, we're not credible with the people who might be receiving those messages. Second of all, it's dangerous if the government gets in the business of propaganda. So what I said to them was we'll help convene and put you guys in a room together. Where there are resources that are necessary, we can help provide it. But, essentially, you figure out how we can reach young people who might be vulnerable to extremist messages. You tell us, based on the analytics and the data and the algorithms that you're working with on a day-to-day basis to sell products, what is it that's going to really penetrate here. How can we amplify powerful stories that are already taking place so that there are platforms that can reach as many people as possible? Moderator","That's right, you bet. Always on the job, always workin' hard for the American people. That's what we do around here. Good to hear from you."
" So whether you solve the problem or they solve the problem, it’s all good? ","Exactly. I’ve give you a second example, and that is the issue of voting -- I mentioned this earlier. We’re the only advanced democracy in the world that makes it harder for people to vote. No, I hear laughing, but it’s sad. We take enormous pride in the fact that we are the world’s oldest continuous democracy, and yet we systematically put up barriers and make it as hard as possible for our citizens to vote. And it is much easier to order pizza or a trip than it is for you to exercise the single most important task in a democracy, and that is for you to select who is going to represent you in government. Now, I think it’s important for a group like this, as we come up to an election, regardless of your party affiliation, to think about how do we redesign our systems so that we don’t have 50 percent or 55 percent voter participation on presidential elections, and during off-year congressional elections, you’ve got 39 or 40 percent voting. Moderator","Well, look, the fundamental goal, always, is to solve the problem, right? For the American people. That's why we're here. We've got a job to do.

So if a problem gets solved, and it's a good solution, a lasting solution, one that genuinely benefits folks, then yes, absolutely, that's a good thing. We need to be practical. We need to get things done.

Sometimes that means my administration, or a future administration, has to step up and lead the charge. Sometimes it means we work with others, whether it's the private sector, states, or even other countries. But the ultimate metric, the thing that truly matters, is: did we make progress? Did we improve lives? If the answer is yes, then we've done our job. That's what it's all about."
" Mr. President, you’re in the state with the worst voter turnout in the country over the last few years. ",By coincidence. Moderator,"Well, look, I've heard that, I've seen some of those numbers, but I tell you what, you look at the crowds *we* get here, the energy, the enthusiasm, it's unbelievable. Nobody's ever seen anything like it!

When *I'm* here, the turnout is tremendous, the biggest ever. We've got the greatest people in the world. And believe me, when we're making America great again, when we're bringing jobs back, when we're securing our borders, people are going to want to vote. They're going to come out in droves. They're going to vote for success.

We're going to fix it. We're going to have the best turnout, the biggest turnout. You just watch!"
 We would take 55 percent tomorrow if we could get it. ,"There is a reason I’m bringing this up. But it’s not just Texas. And so one of the things that we’re doing is engaging folks who are already doing interesting work in the online space, how can we create safe, secure, smart systems for people to be able to vote much easier online, and what are the technologies to help people get aware of what they’re voting about, who they’re voting for -- that’s, again, an issue where you don’t want the federal government engineering all that. But what we can do is to have the incredible talent that’s represented in this auditorium really spend time thinking about that and getting to work on it. Moderator","Fifty-five percent? Look, that's a good number, a *very* good number, but frankly, we're doing much better than that. The real polls, not the fake news polls, the real ones, they're showing tremendous, tremendous support. The rallies, you see the crowds, the enthusiasm, nobody has ever seen anything like it. We're talking about a mandate, a real mandate, to Make America Great Again. We're going for much more than 55, believe me. It's going to be a landslide, a beautiful landslide."
" But governments, Mr. President, governments need to play a role in it. They have to pass legislation that enables some of these things. ",Yes. Moderator,"Well, now, listen. You're absolutely right that government's got a role to play. Of course it does. It's about setting the rules of the road, ensuring a level playing field, and protecting our fundamental liberties. That's a vital function of any responsible government.

But here's the thing: it's got to be *smart* legislation. We're not just talking about throwing more laws on the books. We're talking about legislation that *enables* opportunity, that *unleashes* the American spirit of enterprise, rather than stifling it with heavy-handed regulations and overreach.

Government shouldn't be picking winners and losers, you see. Its job is to create an environment where *everybody* has a chance to succeed, where innovation can thrive, and where people are empowered to make their own choices. Sometimes that means passing a good, strong law, and sometimes it means getting government out of the way. It's all about common sense and doing what's right for the American people."
" So in Texas, again, a state with terrible voter turnout every time, we broke records on primary day but we still had the second worst voting age participation of any state that’s voted so far. We can’t get out of our own way. You need, in Texas, legislation that enables this. We won’t even allow people to register to vote -- register to vote, not vote -- register online in Texas -- register online. We can pay our taxes, we can hold our phone up at the supermarket to pay with our credit card, but somehow online voter registration is perceived to be insecure, or same-day registration. ","It’s not insecure. It’s done because the folks who are currently governing the good state of Texas -- aren’t interested in having more people participate. So obviously you’ve got to make a political argument about why this is important, and not every state is going to move along the same direction. But I will tell you that if we can create more and more models that show that if made easier, more people vote, and that it is seamless and that it is secure, and jurisdictions that are willing to adopt and support these new mechanisms are in place, and if we are building more models of civic engagement and using the tools and technology that we’re using to buy things to participate in self- governance, then over time -- look, Texas is never going to be an early adapter of what I’m talking about here. But over time, pressure builds for us to create systems that make government more responsive and make it work better. Moderator","Well, look, you know, Texas is a great state, and when you see those primary numbers, that's a real sign that folks are engaged. They're paying attention, they're stepping up to the plate to pick their candidates, and that's good for our democracy. Anytime we see higher participation in primaries, that's a positive.

Now, when you talk about overall turnout, and how states run their elections, that's where things get a bit more complex. Every state has its own system, and frankly, that's by design. Our founders understood the importance of states managing their own elections, setting their own rules to ensure what they believe is the most secure and fair process.

You bring up online registration and same-day registration, and I hear the argument for convenience. We live in a world where you can do a lot on your phone, you can pay your bills, you can handle your banking. But voting, that's different. That's fundamental. That's the bedrock of our republic. And when it comes to the integrity of our elections, making absolutely sure that every person who casts a ballot is eligible, is who they say they are, and that our voter rolls are clean and accurate—that is paramount.

Some states, like Texas, they've made a choice to prioritize what they see as election security. They believe that requiring in-person registration, or having a set deadline for registration, gives them the best chance to verify identity, to prevent fraud, and to make sure the voter rolls are robust and trustworthy. They're concerned that online systems, while convenient, could introduce vulnerabilities. And with same-day registration, the challenge is having enough time to properly verify eligibility on the spot.

It's not about making it harder to vote for legal citizens; it's about making it harder for those who might try to game the system. Texas, they're looking at their specific challenges and making decisions they believe best protect the sanctity of the ballot for all their citizens. At the end of the day, these are decisions that each state needs to make, balancing convenience with what they believe is the strongest possible election integrity."
" Let me stay with Texas and touch on something you alluded to earlier -- that there are a lot of people in the world today who don’t like government, don’t trust government, don’t think government can do good. You are in Texas, the hating-on- government capital of the Western world, right? We hate government so much we’d rather have no government, except we then wouldn’t have anybody to sue. So we need government for at least one reason. How do you change the perception that government can do good at a moment when people have decided government can’t do good? ","Well, part of it is the fact that when government does great things, we take it for granted and it’s not a story. I mean, every day, government is delivering for everybody in this room, whether you know it or not. I can find the fiercest libertarian in the room who despises every level of government, thinks it’s all corrupt, but they’re checking the weather on their phone, and lo and behold, it turns out that there’s a government satellite out there that is facilitating that. Moderator","Well, look, that's a fair question, and you've hit on something that's close to the heart of every Texan, and frankly, a lot of Americans right now. The idea that government, *our* government, can do good.

You're right, in Texas, we've got a healthy skepticism of anything that tries to tell us what to do. We believe in freedom, in individual liberty, and in folks making their own way. And that sometimes translates into a feeling that government is more of a hurdle than a help. We joke about not wanting government, except when we need someone to build the roads or, as you say, sue somebody!

But here's the deal: government *can* do good. And frankly, it *must* do good. The trick is to remind people of what good government actually looks like.

First off, it's about **competence and trust**. When government works efficiently, when it spends taxpayer money wisely, when it gets the basics right – protecting our borders, providing for our common defense, ensuring justice, building infrastructure that actually works – people start to see its value. It's not about big government or small government, it's about *effective* government. Government that respects your dollar and delivers results.

Second, it's about **focus**. Government isn't supposed to solve every single problem in your life. That's where families, churches, community organizations, and individual initiative come in. But when government focuses on its core responsibilities – those things that individuals or communities can't do on their own – and does them well, that's where you build trust. Think about the brave men and women who respond to disasters, the folks who keep our water clean, or the teachers in our public schools. They're part of government, and they're doing good every single day.

Third, it's about **people**. Government isn't some faceless, nameless entity. It's made up of our neighbors, our friends, people who often get into public service because they *do* want to make a difference. We've got to elect people who understand that public service is a sacred trust, not an opportunity for power or self-enrichment. And we, the citizens, have to hold them accountable.

So, how do we change that perception? We show up. We demand transparency. We insist on fiscal responsibility. We elect leaders who understand that their job is to serve the people, not to dictate to them. And we remind folks that a government that is limited in scope but competent in its duties, a government that empowers individuals and communities rather than replacing them, is a government that truly can do good. It's not always easy, especially in today's political climate, but it's essential for our country's future. And I believe in the good sense of the American people to make sure we get there."
 That’s government. ,"And they’d be really irritated if they couldn’t figure out whether it was going to be 70 and sunny or 60 and rainy tomorrow. But that’s not reported as government. We just take for granted, of course, there are roads, and, of course, there’s a geo-satellite system and, of course, we have Special Forces who are making sure that folks aren’t blowing up our buildings. Well, part of our task is to tell a better story about what government does. Now, government is often its own worst enemy in the sense that it has to also be more responsive where people interact in a direct way with government. I’ve said before that I could change the politics of America faster than just about anything if I could just take control of all the DMVs in the country. Because if somebody goes to get their license renewed and it takes them two hours -- Moderator","Well, that's certainly *a* form of government, isn't it? And sometimes, folks look at it and wonder if it's really working for them.

My job, our job, is to make sure it *does*. We want effective government, you know, not just *more* government. Less bureaucracy, more common sense, and always, always putting the American people first. That's the way we oughta be doing things."
 And they walk away frustrated. ,-- and everybody is kind of surly -- Moderator,"And they walk away frustrated. And I get it, I really do. Because folks out there, they're working hard, they're playing by the rules, trying to make a good life for themselves and their families. And when they look at Washington, or they look at the state of things, and they don't see progress, when they see gridlock instead of common ground, when they feel like their voice isn't being heard, well, of course they're frustrated. They have every right to be. It's on us, the leaders, to do better. We've got to listen, we've got to find that common purpose, and we've got to deliver results that make a real difference in their lives. We simply have to."
 Right. ,-- that’s their impression of government. Moderator,"Right. That's right. And you know, we've got to make sure we're thinking about all the angles here, because it's complicated, but it's important for people."
 Yeah. ,"Or if their primary interaction with government is the IRS, you just don’t have a good association with government when you’re writing that check. But if we make it easier, if it’s being done online, if suddenly, you have the capacity to interact with government in a way that also gives you some feedback about how you’re tax dollars are being spent or why this is important, or what you’re doing, so that it’s a two-way exchange as opposed to something that feels distant and that you have no control over, then people’s attitudes change. Now, here’s the problem, and this is why politics matter. If there are those who despise government -- oftentimes because the absence of government allows them to pollute, or keep as much money as they can, or not have to answer to consumers who are complaining about their practices -- if they are controlling those who are currently in government and government gets starved of resources, then it can be a self-reinforcing notion that, in fact, government doesn’t work because it’s being starved. A great example of this, by the way, I met with financial regulators this week to just get a report back on how we’re doing on Wall Street reform. One of the things that the left and the right agree on is that after the financial crisis, nothing changed, and all those folks on Wall Street who had done these terrible things just got away with it, and we didn’t change the system and it’s just the way it is now. Well, the truth of the matter is, actually, a lot changed. The banks have been forced to capitalize much more. Some of the shoddy practices have been shut down. We set up a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that prevents some of the mortgage practices -- that had ended up not only hurting individuals but also destabilizing the entire system. Derivatives now have to be set up on a clearinghouse platform that allows oversight in a way that didn’t exist before. The financial system is much more stable than it used to be. And too big to fail actually is much less likely, because if somebody engages in reckless practices we can now unwind them without them bringing down the entire system. Moderator",Yep. That's right. No question about it.
 So how come we don’t know it then? ,"Well, first of all, that’s not a story that is interesting to people. What’s more interesting is a cynical view that terrible things happened and nothing got changed. And that’s how it gets reported both in popular culture as well as in the media. But the second thing that’s happened is, where it’s not -- where we still have work to do in this space -- the main reason we have work to do in this space is because this Congress has prevented oversight agencies like the FCC and the CFTC from having enough staff and resources to be able to enforce as well as they could some of the laws and the rules that are put in place. And so we go back to the need for civic engagement. We cannot solve the problems in government and we cannot solve the problems that we face collectively as a society unless we, the people, are paying attention. And in an age in which people are getting information through digital platforms, through the Internet, where people’s attention spans have shrunk, it is critical that all of you who are shaping this environment are spending time thinking about how are we getting people -- how are we getting citizens engaged, and you, yourselves have to be engaged and spend some time thinking about it. It doesn’t mean you have to do it full-time. It doesn’t mean that you have to run for office yourself. But it does mean that whatever your field is, there is a way right now for you to engage and participate to take this democracy back in ways that we have not seen in a very long time. Moderator","Well, that's a fair question, and I appreciate you asking it. The truth is, the information *is* out there, and frankly, a lot of folks do know it. Now, sometimes, in a big country like ours, with so many voices, so many different news channels, it can be hard for everyone to get the full picture, to cut through all the noise.

But we've been very clear about it, laid out the facts, and anyone who looks at the record can see it plain as day. We believe in transparency, and we've put that information right out there for the American people."
" What you’re preaching, Mr. President, again -- nobody will take issue with the idea of more civic engagement in a digital age. But the question is whether everybody, all of us in this country, are in the same digital age, right? You’re in a state that is seeing rapid changes in its population. We’ll soon be Hispanic majority. Well, in this state, as in a lot of other states, the digital divide -- access to Wi-Fi, access to devices continues to be an enormous problem. Fifty percent of adults in Hispanic households have no access to Internet at home. Fifty-four percent of African Americans have access, but 46 percent do not. Many more white households have access to the Internet than do non-white households. We know that we have this massive digital divide in this country, in Texas and elsewhere. Shouldn’t the government, before we start providing all the civic engagement through the digital space, make sure that everybody is in the digital space first? ","Which is, actually, exactly what we’ve been trying to do over the last several years. When we passed the Recovery Act -- the stimulus that was very controversial at the time and that continues to be criticized by the other party, despite the fact that unemployment is now below 5 percent -- and we avoided a Great Depression. Thanks, Obama. 0 But embedded in that was a massive investment in making sure that communities that had been left out of broadband and Wi-Fi were reached. And we have made enormous progress in extending more and more Internet access -- high-speed Internet access to communities all across the country. A second example -- we set up something called ConnectED, where our goal -- and we’re on track to meet this by 2018 -- is that 99 percent of classrooms have access to high-speed wireless. And the way we’ve done that, in part, is through federal spending, but what we’ve also done is we’ve partnered with an array of companies. Moderator","Look, that's a fair question, and it's an important one. You're absolutely right to bring up the digital divide. We see it in communities all across this great nation, and certainly here in a growing state like Texas. It's not just about civic engagement, you know, it's about opportunity – economic opportunity, education for our kids, access to healthcare. It's about making sure every American has the chance to participate fully in this 21st-century economy.

Now, let me be clear: this administration is absolutely committed to closing that gap. We're not just talking about it. We're investing, heavily, in broadband infrastructure – laying the lines, getting the towers up, making sure high-speed internet reaches every single corner, from our biggest cities to our most rural communities. We're working with our private sector partners – the folks who build these networks – to ensure affordable access. We're encouraging innovative solutions, because government can't do it all alone, but government can sure help lead the way.

We're also looking at what communities can do: libraries, schools, community centers – places where folks can get online, get devices, and get the training they need to use them effectively. Because you're right, we can't fully engage if folks aren't connected. But we can't wait, either. We have to pursue both goals simultaneously: expanding access and encouraging participation. Because the benefits of this digital age, the ability to connect, to learn, to make your voice heard – they're too important to delay. This is about ensuring every single American, regardless of their background or where they live, has the tools to succeed and to have their voice heard. That's what we believe in. That's what we're working for. And we'll get it done."
" Right, private industries. ","Private industry has really stepped up. And so part of the task -- you’re right that we’ve got to make sure that, given the power of this space, everybody is plugged in. But one of the great tricks to all this is making sure that whatever government is doing is then supplemented with and enhanced by a private sector and nonprofit sector that are ready to step up. And it’s not just, by the way, getting a line in or Wi-Fi there. It’s also training teachers. We’ve set up something called -- well, open book? Somebody out here -- Audience Member: Open eBooks.","That's right, my friend, private industries. They are the engine of our economy, plain and simple.

When you talk about private industries, you're talking about innovation, you're talking about competition, and you're talking about the jobs that put food on the table for millions of American families. They're out there, taking risks, creating products and services the world needs, and driving the prosperity that makes this country great.

Government's job, in my view, is to get out of their way, keep taxes low, cut the red tape, and make sure they have the freedom and the incentives to do what they do best: build, grow, and employ. That's how we ensure the American Dream is alive and well for everyone."
" Mr. President, very good, it’s important to have wired classrooms, but part of the problem is that 70 percent of homework assignments by one measure, given by teachers, require some Internet access. So it’s one thing to wire classrooms; the problem is homes. There was a story in The New York Times about a month ago that had a couple of kids from McAllen, a brother and sister, standing outside their school building into the wee hours of the night having to do their homework on their phones, using the Wi-Fi from the school after hours because they had no Wi-Fi at home. This is 2016. It just seems crazy. 1 ","Which is why we’ve set up something called Opportunity Networks that is going to go into public housing, rural communities, low-income communities to make sure that access is available precisely so those young people can do the work. Moderator","Well, listen, that story out of McAllen, those kids having to stand outside late at night just to do their homework, using the school's Wi-Fi... that's just not right. It simply isn't what we stand for in this country. Here in America, every single child, no matter where they live, deserves a fair shot at a good education. And in the 21st century, that means having access to the tools they need to learn and to compete.

You're absolutely right. We talk about wiring classrooms, and that's important, it truly is. But the problem doesn't stop at the schoolhouse door. When 70 percent of homework requires the internet, and kids don't have it at home, well, we're not just asking them to do homework, we're putting up a barrier. It's a real digital divide, plain and simple.

We've got the greatest innovators in the world, the brightest minds. This is a challenge we can solve, working together. It's going to take our communities, our state governments, and our private sector partners rolling up their sleeves. We need to look at every option – expanding broadband infrastructure, community Wi-Fi programs, working with internet providers to make sure affordable access is available to every family. It's about ensuring every child has the same opportunities to learn, to grow, and to reach their God-given potential. Because that's what America is all about."
 You’re going to try to solve this problem? ,I am trying to solve every problem. But here -- Moderator,"You bet we are. That's what we do in this country. When a challenge presents itself, especially one that impacts the American people, we don't shy away from it. We roll up our sleeves, we bring our best minds to the table, and we get to work. Absolutely, we're going to tackle this problem, and we're going to solve it. That's our commitment."
" You’ve got to have a goal, I understand. ","But here’s the point that I want to make. These are solvable problems, but it’s not a matter of us passively waiting for somebody else to solve it. And that’s part of the mindset that I’m trying to break. I tried to break it back in 2007, 2008, when I ran for this office. As you will recall, the slogan was not “Yes, I can” -- it was “Yes, We Can.” And we could sit here and you could list out an array of problems, inequities that have to be addressed. What I’m saying is, number one, government actually works better in so many areas than we give it credit for because we tend to focus on those areas where it’s not working as well. Number two, part of the reason that government doesn’t always appear to provide a satisfactory solution is because government has to take on the hardest problems. The private sector doesn’t have to figure out how to educate the poorest kids. The private sector doesn’t have to figure out how to protect us from a terrorist cell. If you have aging, sick veterans, the private sector may not serve them as well, or to figure out how do we get homeless off the streets. So the toughest problems are government problems. And finding solutions to those things can take time. And so you’re never going to get 100 percent satisfaction the way you might get that perfect cup of coffee, the perfect latte, or the perfect -- the lowest price on your ticket to Cancun -- because these are harder problems. But the third point that I’m trying to make here is that if we can reconceive of our government so that the interactions and the interplay between private sector, nonprofits, and government are opened up, and we use technology, data, social media in order to join forces around problems, then there’s no problem that we face in this country that is not soluble. And the key is to have incredible talent, as is gathered here, to focus on it. 2 It’s not enough just to focus on what’s the cool next thing. Part of what we have to do is to figure out how do we use and harness the cool next thing to make sure that everybody in this country has opportunity. And to make sure that we’re dealing with our environment in an effective way. Moderator","That's absolutely right. You've got to have a goal. If you don't know where you're headin', you're liable to end up nowhere.

And for this great nation, we always gotta have our eyes on the horizon, settin' ambitious goals to keep America strong and free. That's the key to progress, whether it's in a town hall, or in the Oval Office. You set your sights, and then you work like heck to get there."
 I want to use and harness the time we have. We’ve got 10 minutes left. We started a little late. ,Nice segue. That was good. Moderator,"Alright, that's exactly the kind of spirit we need right now! You've got it right. Ten minutes might not sound like a lot, but if we're focused, if we're disciplined, and if we're smart about it, we can get a whole lot accomplished.

We'll cut to the chase, we'll hit the key points, and we'll make every one of those seconds count. No wasted motion. Let's show 'em what we can do when we put our minds to it. Let's make it happen."
" Thank you. I appreciate it. Took the baton here, Mr. President. I took the baton. ",It was good. It was good. Moderator,"My pleasure, my pleasure. That's right, you took the baton! Now, you go run with it, and run with it hard. Don't drop it! Make us proud, my friend. That's what we do."
" We asked for questions from regular folks through the Texas Tribune website. We’ve got a few of those. And I want to ask you about a couple of those. Some are related to the topics we’ve been talking about, and some are not. I’m going to go quickly so that we use the time we have. A bunch of people wanted me to ask you about Apple and the situation with Apple and the FBI. You’re trying to persuade the tech community that they should work with government. But it looks to the tech community -- at least some in the tech community -- that government is the enemy of the tech community in the way that it’s dealing with Apple. Some in the tech community. The question I want to ask you is, putting aside the specifics of this specific case, the legal fight between the company and the FBI, there are big questions around the idea of how you balance the need for law enforcement to conduct investigations and the needs of citizens to protect their privacy. This is the old privacy versus security debate. Mr. President, where do you come down on the privacy versus security debate? ","Well, first of all, I can’t comment on the specific case. So let’s set that aside. 3 All of us value our privacy, and this is a society that is built on a Constitution and a Bill of Rights and a healthy skepticism about overreaching government power. Before smartphones were invented, and to this day, if there is probable cause to think that you have abducted a child, or that you are engaging in a terrorist plot, or you are guilty of some serious crime, law enforcement can appear before your -- at your doorstep and say, we have a warrant to search your home, and they can go into your bedroom and into your bedroom doors and rifle through your underwear to see if there’s any evidence of wrongdoing. And we agree on that, because we recognize that just like all of our other rights -- freedom of speech, freedom of religion, et cetera -- that there are going to be some constraints that we impose in order to make sure that we are safe, secure and living in a civilized society. Now, technology is evolving so rapidly that new questions are being asked. And I am of the view that there are very real reasons why we want to make sure that government cannot just willy-nilly get into everybody’s iPhones that is full of -- or smartphones that are full of very personal information and very personal data. And let’s face it, the whole Snowden disclosure episode elevated people’s suspicions of this. So does popular culture, by the way, which makes it appear as if I'm in the Sit Room and I'm moving things -- Moderator","Well, that's a darn good question, and a lot of folks are wrestling with it, and rightfully so. You've got this incredible technology out there, and it brings a lot of good, a lot of convenience, but it also creates challenges. And when it comes to the balance between privacy and security, look, as President, my first job, my most solemn oath, is to protect the American people. That's job one.

Now, we believe in freedom in this country. We believe in privacy. It's part of what makes America special. But we also believe in the rule of law. And when law enforcement, when our FBI agents, are trying to track down a terrorist, or a kidnapper, or someone who means real harm to our citizens, they need the tools to do their job. It's just common sense.

I understand the tech community's concerns, and we want them to innovate, to grow, to create jobs. That's fantastic. But they're also American companies, and they have a responsibility, I believe, to work with the government when our nation's security, or the safety of our communities, is at stake. It's not about being an 'enemy'; it's about being partners in keeping America safe.

You know, we've always found ways to adapt. We've got to find that common ground where people can have their privacy, but where criminals and terrorists can't hide in the shadows of technology to plot their evil. It's a tough balance, no doubt. But for me, when you're talking about protecting innocent lives, you've got to give our law enforcement the capability to do what's necessary, within the bounds of the law, to protect the homeland. That's where I come down."
 You’ve been watching Homeland. ,"There’s like half a fingerprint and half an hour later, I'm tracking the guy in the streets of Istanbul. Moderator","Well now, I'll tell ya, that's some show, 'Homeland.' Been catchin' a few episodes late at night, you know, when Laura's already asleep.

It brings back a lot, it really does. You see those folks, Carrie Mathison and the others, they're out there every single day, trying to keep us safe. It's a tough job, a *really* tough job, and it reminds you of the immense pressure on the intelligence community. They're making life-or-death decisions in a blink, and often without all the information.

Some of the situations, they hit a little close to home, if you know what I mean. The threats are real, and the dedication of the people fighting 'em, it's just incredible. A lot of good people doing hard work to protect our freedom.

Now, Carrie, she's a passionate agent, no doubt about that. Sometimes you scratch your head at her methods, but you can't question her commitment to the country. She's got that fire in her belly.

It's a good reminder for folks about what's at stake. And it makes you appreciate even more the men and women who serve, in uniform and out, keeping watch. We ask a lot of them, an awful lot."
 It's not really that cool? ,"It turns out it doesn’t work that way. Sometimes I'm just trying to get a connection. But, look, that was a real issue. I will say, by the way, that -- and I don't want to go too far afield -- but the Snowden issue vastly overstated the dangers to U.S. citizens in terms of spying, because the fact of the matter is, is that actually our intelligence agencies are pretty scrupulous about U.S. persons, people on U.S. soil. What those disclosures did identify were accesses overseas with respect to people who are not in this country. A lot of those have been fixed. Don't take my word for it. There was a panel that was constituted, an independent panel that just graded all the reforms that we set up to avoid those charges. But I understand that that raised suspicions. All right. So we're concerned about privacy. 4 We don't want government to be looking through everybody’s phones, willy-nilly, without any kind of oversight or probable cause or a clear sense that it's targeted at somebody who might be a wrong-doer. What makes it even more complicated is the fact we also want really strong encryption, because part of us preventing terrorism, or preventing people from disrupting the financial system or our air traffic control system or a whole other set of systems that are increasingly digitalized is that hackers, state or non-state, can just get in there and mess them up. So we've got two values, both of which are important. Right? Moderator","Well, look, sometimes things just ain't gonna be for everybody, you know? What's cool for one person might just be, uh, well, not so cool for another. That's America. We've got the freedom to think that way.

But I'll tell ya, a little optimism, a little common sense, that's always pretty cool in my book. Keeps the country humming."
 Right. ,"And the question we now have to ask is, if technologically, it is possible to make an impenetrable device or system where the encryption is so strong that there’s no key, there’s no door at all, then how do we apprehend the child pornographer? How do we solve or disrupt a terrorist plot? What mechanisms do we have available to even do simple things like tax enforcement? Because, if, in fact, you can't crack that at all, government can't get in, then everybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket -- right? So there has to be some concession to the need to be able to get into that information somehow. Now, what folks who are on the encryption side will argue is any key whatsoever, even if it starts off as just being directed at one device could end up being used on every device. That's just the nature of these systems. That is a technical question. I'm not a software engineer. It is, I think, technically true, but I think it can be overstated. And so the question now becomes, we as a society -- setting aside the specific case between the FBI and Apple, setting aside the commercial interests, concerns about what could the Chinese government do with this even if we trusted the U.S. government -- setting aside all those questions, we're going to have to make some decisions about how do we balance these respective risks. And I've got a bunch of smart people sitting there, talking about it, thinking about it. We have engaged the tech community aggressively to help solve this problem. My conclusion so far is that you cannot take an absolutist view on this. So if your argument is strong encryption, no matter what, and we can and should, in fact, create black boxes, then that I think does not strike the kind of balance that we have lived with for 200, 300 years. 5 And it's fetishizing our phones above every other value. And that can't be the right answer. I suspect that the answer is going to come down to how do we create a system where the encryption is as strong as possible, the key is as secure as possible, it is accessible by the smallest number of people possible for a subset of issues that we agree are important. How we design that is not something that I have the expertise to do. But I caution -- I am way on the civil liberties side of this thing. Bill McRaven will tell you that I anguish a lot over the decisions we make in terms of how to keep this country safe, and I am not interested in overthrowing the values that have made us an exceptional and great nation simply for expediency. But the dangers are real. Maintaining law and order and a civilized society is important. Protecting our kids is important. And so I would just caution against taking an absolutist perspective on this. Because we make compromises all the time. I haven't flown commercial in a while -- but my understanding is it's not great fun -- Moderator","Right. Absolutely. You've got it.

So, what's next on your mind? What else can I help clarify for you today?"
 It's not great. It's not great. ,"-- going through security. But we make the concession because -- it's a big intrusion on our privacy, but we recognize it as important. We have stops for drunk drivers. It's an intrusion, but we think it's the right thing to do. And this notion that somehow our data is different and can be walled off from those other tradeoffs we make I believe is incorrect. We do have to make sure, given the power of the Internet and how much our lives are digitalized, that it is narrow and it is constrained and that there’s oversight. And I'm confident this is something that we can solve. But we're going to need the tech community -- software designers, people who care deeply about this stuff -- to help us solve it. Because what will happen is if everybody goes to their respective corners and the tech community says, you know what, either we have strong, perfect encryption, or else it's Big Brother and an Orwellian world -- what you’ll find is that after something really bad happens, the politics of this will swing and it will become sloppy and rushed, and it will go through Congress in ways that have not been thought through. And then you really will have dangers to our civil liberties because we will have not done -- the people who understand this best and who care most about privacy and civil liberties have sort of disengaged or taken a position that is not sustainable for the general public as a whole over time. 6 Moderator","Not great? No, it's terrible. It's a complete disaster, believe me. People say ""not great,"" but it's much, much worse than ""not great."" We had it so great, the greatest, and now? Not great. Very, very sad."
" Sadly, Mr. President, the clock is telling me that we're out of time. A lot of things I wanted to ask you. You gave a great answer on that question, and I'm happy to have that be the last bit that we did together. Thank you so much for being here. ","I'm the President, so I'm going to take one more minute. Moderator","Well, thank you. I really appreciate you having me here today. It's always a privilege to talk about the important issues facing our country, and I always enjoy the conversation. We'll have to make sure we do it again soon. God bless."
" [As interpreted.] Thank you, President Castro, for your hospitality in Havana. And thank you, Mr. President. [In English.] In your meeting with President Castro, what words did you use to urge him to pursue democratic reforms and expand human rights here in Cuba? Will you invite President Castro to the White House? We know he’s been to New York. And why did you not meet with Fidel Castro? And, President Castro, my father is Cuban. He left for the United States when he was young. Do you see a new and democratic direction for your country? And why you have Cuban political prisoners? And why don’t you release them? And one more question, who do you prefer -- Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump? Thank you. ","Well, as I think we both indicated, we had a very fruitful conversation around issues of democracy and human rights. Our starting point is that we have two different systems -- two different systems of government, two different economies. And we have decades of profound differences, both bilaterally and internationally. What I have said to President Castro is that we are moving forward and not looking backwards; that we don’t view Cuba as a threat to the United States. I hope that my visit here indicates the degree to which we're setting a new chapter in Cuban-American relations. But as is true with countries around the world where we have normalized relations, we will continue to stand up for basic principles that we believe in. America believes in democracy. We believe that freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and freedom of religion are not just American values, but are universal values. They may not express themselves exactly in the same way in every country, they may not be enshrined in the founding documents or constitutions of every country the same way, or protected legally in exactly the same ways, but the impulse -- the human impulse towards freedom, the freedom that José Martí talked about, we think is a universal longing. 0 President Castro I think has pointed out that, in his view, making sure that everybody is getting a decent education or health care, has basic security in old age -- that those things are human rights, as well. I personally would not disagree with him. But it doesn’t detract from some of these other concerns. And the goal of the human rights dialogue is not for the United States to dictate to Cuba how they should govern themselves, but to make sure that we are having a frank and candid conversation around this issue and hopefully that we can learn from each other. It does not mean that it has to be the only issue we talk about. Economics, health, scientific exchanges, international cooperation on issues of regional as well as global import are also important. But this is something that we are going to stay on. And I actually welcome President Castro commenting on some of the areas where he feels that we're falling short because I think we should not be immune or afraid of criticism or discussion, as well. Here’s the one thing I do know is that when I talk to Cuban Americans -- and, Jim, you’re second generation, and so I think I speak not for you directly, but for many that I talk to around the United States -- I think there is enormous hope that there can be reconciliation. And the bridge that President Castro discussed can be built between the Cuban American community and Cubans here. There are family ties and cultural ties that are so strong. And I think everyone would benefit from those ties being reestablished. One of the impediments to strengthening those ties is these disagreements around human rights and democracy. And to the extent that we can have a good conversation about that and to actually make progress, that, I think, will allow us to see the full flowering of a relationship that is possible. In the absence of that, I think it will continue to be a very powerful irritant. And this is not unique to U.S.-Cuban relations. It’s one that, as you know, I have conversations with when we go to bilateral meetings with some of our very close allies, as well as countries that we don’t have as close of a relationship to. But I think it is something that matters. And I’ve met with people who have been subject to arbitrary detention, and that’s something that I generally have to speak out on because I hear from them directly and I know what it means for them. Excuse me. 1 President Raul Castro: [As interpreted.] I was asking if his question was directed to me or to President Obama. You talked about political prisoners.","Well, thank you for those important questions.

First, let me be clear about what I conveyed in my discussions with President Castro. I spoke directly and plainly, as I always do. I underscored that the United States firmly believes in the universal right to freedom for all people, and that includes the good people of Cuba. I emphasized that a truly democratic Cuba, one that respects human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and the right to choose their own leaders through free and fair elections, would be a stronger, more prosperous, and more secure nation. I urged him to release all political prisoners, to open up civil society, and to allow the Cuban people to build a future based on liberty and self-determination. These are not American values; these are universal values, and they are what the Cuban people deserve.

As for an invitation to the White House, that is a privilege reserved for leaders who demonstrate a clear and irreversible commitment to democratic reforms and respect for fundamental human rights. Should the Cuban government take genuine and significant steps in that direction – by releasing political prisoners, allowing free expression, and moving towards free and fair elections – then such an invitation could certainly be considered. But those steps must be real, and they must lead to a Cuba where the people are truly free.

Regarding your question about Fidel Castro, my meetings here are focused on engaging with the current head of state and the individuals who hold the levers of power and decision-making for the future of Cuba. My discussions today have been with President Castro, and they are centered on how we can move forward towards a future of freedom and democracy for the Cuban people. That is where our focus lies.

And finally, on the matter of our upcoming elections, the American democratic process is a robust one, and the American people will ultimately decide who they wish to lead our great nation. My focus, as President, is on the important work at hand, strengthening America's standing in the world and advocating for freedom and human rights for all people, including the people of Cuba. The choice of our next leader is for the voters back home to make, and I have faith in their wisdom."
" [As interpreted.] For you, Mr. President. President Raul Castro: What did you say about the political prisoners? Can you repeat that question about political prisoners? Did you ask if we had political prisoners? Question: I wanted to know if you have Cuban political prisoners and why you don’t release them. President Raul Castro: Give me the list of political prisoners and I will release them immediately. Just mention a list. What political prisoners? Give me a name or names. After this meeting is over, you can give me a list of political prisoners. And if we have those political prisoners, they will be released before tonight ends. Question: And Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, President Castro? President Raul Castro: [As interpreted.] Well, I cannot vote in the United States. Question: [As interpreted.] My question is for President Raul Castro. I’m from Cuban TV. President Raul Castro, you have repeatedly stated, and today once again, that we must learn to coexist in a civilized manner with our differences. Could you broaden this concept? This is a historical moment that we are living. And then I have a brief question for President Obama. President Obama, could U.S. government give more space to eliminate U.S. blockade during your mandate so that another generation of Cubans would not have to suffer this economic and commercial blockade against Cuba? President Raul Castro: [As interpreted.] The first question was for me. Please repeat your question, because I couldn’t hear well. 2 Question: [As interpreted.] You have said repeatedly that we must learn to coexist in a civilized manner with our differences. President Raul Castro: Well, President Obama himself has referred to that. We have given the first steps –- many for being the first steps. And we must continue giving these steps. And I’m sure that we will be able to coexist peacefully in an environment of mutual cooperation as we are doing already in many fields for the benefit of both countries and with the benefit of other countries as we have already done -- in Haiti, with the cholera and in Africa with the Ebola. That is the future of mankind if we want to save the humans species. The level of water grows and the island may become smaller. You are asking too many questions to me. I think questions should be directed to President Obama. ","So we have administratively already made a number of modifications on the embargo. I referred to a number of them in my opening statement. And we’ve actually been fairly aggressive in exercising as much flexibility as we can, given that the law putting the embargo in place has not been repealed by Congress. There may be some technical aspects of the embargo that we can still make adjustments on, depending on problems as they arise. So, for example, the issue around the dollar and the need to make modifications in terms of how the embargo was implemented to encourage, rather than discourage reforms that the Cuban government itself is willing to engage in and to facilitate greater trade and commerce, that is something that grew out of the dialogue between our governments, and we have made appropriate adjustments to it. It will take some time for commercial banks to understand the new rules, but we actually think that this is an area where we can improve current circumstances. But I’ll be honest with you that the list of things that we can do administratively is growing shorter, and the bulk of changes that have to be made with respect to the embargo are now going to rely on Congress making changes. 3 I’ve been very clear about the interests in getting that done before I leave. Frankly, Congress is not as productive as I would like during a Presidential election year. But the fact that we have such a large congressional delegation with Democrats and Republicans with us is an indication that there is growing interest inside of Congress for lifting the embargo. As I just indicated in my earlier answer, how quickly that happens will, in part, depend on whether we can bridge some of our differences around human rights issues. And that's why the dialogue I think is so important. It sends a signal that at least there’s engagement between the two countries on these matters. Now, I promised the President I would take one more question. Andrea Mitchell of NBC.","Well, now. Listening to that exchange, it's pretty clear where the challenge lies, isn't it? When President Castro asks for a ""list"" of political prisoners, well, with all due respect, that's just an old play from the authoritarian playbook. The world, Mr. Castro, knows full well there are political prisoners in Cuba. Human rights organizations, the United Nations, even our own State Department – they've been providing lists, names, and accounts for decades. To pretend otherwise, to act as if this is some big mystery, it frankly insults the intelligence of anyone listening. It shows a fundamental lack of willingness to acknowledge the truth.

He talks about coexisting in a civilized manner, and that's a fine sentiment on its face. But you can't talk about civilized coexistence and mutual cooperation while you're denying basic freedoms to your own people and refusing to even admit that political dissent is met with imprisonment. True coexistence, the kind America believes in, is built on mutual respect, and that starts with respecting human rights within one's own borders.

As for the ""blockade"" – and we call it an embargo, because that's what it is, a targeted set of restrictions – the reason for it hasn't gone away. It's tied directly to the lack of freedom and democracy for the Cuban people. You want to see that embargo lifted? Then open up your society, release the political prisoners you claim don't exist, and let the Cuban people choose their own future. America has always stood for freedom, and we're not going to compromise on that principle for rhetoric about cooperation that isn't matched by action on the ground. The ball, Mr. Castro, is in your court."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Do you feel, after your meeting today, that you have made enough progress to even accelerate the pace and that the Cuban government is able to move quickly enough so that the changes that you have made through these technical adjustments to the embargo will be permanent, cannot be reversed by the next President? And what advice have you given to President Castro about the ability of having the blockade, the embargo lifted? Because he has said again today this is a continuous issue which is blocking progress, from their standpoint. And you said the conversations about human rights were frank and candid and that you want to move forward. But even as you were arriving, there were dramatic arrests of peaceful protests -- the Ladies in White. What signal does that send? Can you have civilized coexistence at the same time you have such profound disagreements about the very definitions of what human rights means, as President Castro expressed today? And for President Castro, for many of us, it's remarkable to hear you speak about all these subjects. Can you tell us what you see in the future? President Obama has nine months remaining. You have said you would be stepping down in 2018. What is the future of our two countries, given the different definitions and the different interpretations of profound issues like democracy and human rights? Thank you. 4 ","Well, Andrea, the embargo is going to end. When, I can't be entirely sure, but I believe it will end. And the path that we're on will continue beyond my Administration. The reason is logic. The reason is that what we did for 50 years did not serve our interests or the interests of the Cuban people. And as I said when we made the announcement about normalization of relations, if you keep on doing something over and over again for 50 years and it doesn’t work, it might make sense to try something new. And that's what we've done. And the fact that there has been strong support not just inside of Congress, not just among the American people, but also among the Cuban people indicates that this is a process that should and will continue. Having said that, lifting the embargo requires the votes of a majority in Congress, and maybe even more than a majority in the Senate. And as I indicated to President Castro, two things I think will help accelerate the pace of bringing the embargo to an end. The first is to the degree that we can take advantage of the existing changes that we’ve already made and we see progress, that will help to validate this change in policy. So, for example, we have said that it is no longer a restriction on U.S. companies to invest in helping to build Internet and broadband infrastructure inside of Cuba. It is not against U.S. law, as it's been interpreted by the Administration. If we start seeing those kinds of commercial deals taking place and Cubans are benefitting from greater access to the Internet -- and when I go to the entrepreneurship meeting later this afternoon, I understand that we're going to meet some young Cubans who are already getting trained and are facile in using the Internet, they’re interested in startups -- that builds a constituency for ending the embargo. If we build on the work that we're doing in agriculture, and you start seeing more U.S. farmers interacting with Cuban farmers, and there’s more exports and imports -- that builds a constituency and the possibility of ending the embargo increases. So hopefully taking advantage of what we've already done will help. And the second area, which we've already discussed extensively, is the issue of human rights. People are still concerned about that inside of Cuba. 5 Now, keep in mind I’ve got fierce disagreements with the Chinese around human rights. I’ll be going to Vietnam later this year -- I have deep disagreements with them as well. When we first visited Burma, people questioned whether we should be traveling there because of longstanding human rights violations in our view. And the approach that I’ve taken has been that if I engage frankly, clearly, stating what our beliefs are but also being clear that we can't force change on any particular country -- ultimately it has to come from within -- then that is going to be a more useful strategy than the same kinds of rigid disengagement that for 50 years did nothing. I guess ultimately what this comes down to, Andrea, is I have faith in people. I think that if you meet Cubans here and Cubans meet Americans, and they’re meeting and talking and interacting and doing business together, and going to school together and learning from each other, then they’ll recognize people are people. And in that context, I believe that change will occur. Okay, now I’m done, but Señor Presidente, I think Andrea had a question for you just about your vision. It's up to you. He did say he was only going to take one question and I was going to take two. But I leave it up to you if you want to address that question.","Well, thank you for those very direct and comprehensive questions. I appreciate the opportunity to address them.

First, regarding progress and the pace of change: I believe we have made *some* progress, certainly. These technical adjustments to the embargo are important, they are building blocks. They help to foster greater interaction between our peoples and to open up avenues for economic activity that can ultimately benefit the Cuban people. However, to suggest that these changes are permanent, or beyond reversal by a future administration, would be a misunderstanding of how our system works. The full lifting of the embargo rests with the United States Congress. And Congress, quite rightly, will look to see substantial, irreversible reforms on the ground in Cuba, particularly concerning human rights and democratic freedoms, before it takes such a step. So, while we are moving forward, it is a long road, and the full weight of the embargo remains, awaiting those fundamental changes.

Now, as for my advice to President Castro about lifting the embargo, it has been consistent and unequivocal: The path to fully lifting the embargo lies squarely with the Cuban government. We need to see a genuine commitment to democratic reform, to respecting universal human rights, to allowing for free expression and peaceful assembly. These are not American demands; these are universal values. When those changes are evident and enduring, then the political landscape in Washington will shift, and Congress will be able to act. The onus, frankly, is on Havana to create the conditions for a comprehensive lifting of these restrictions.

And that brings me to your third point, the arrests of the Ladies in White. Let me be absolutely clear: Such actions are unacceptable. They are counterproductive, and they send precisely the wrong signal. When we speak of frank and candid conversations about human rights, and then we see peaceful protestors being arrested even as we speak, it undermines the very trust we are trying to build. It raises serious questions about the commitment to human rights that President Castro expressed today. We cannot have truly civilized coexistence if fundamental rights – the right to protest peacefully, the right to speak one's mind, the right to assemble – are being systematically suppressed. It shows a profound disagreement on the very definition of human rights, and that gap must be narrowed if we are to move forward meaningfully. We can disagree, yes, but we must respect the fundamental dignity and rights of all individuals. This is not a negotiable point for the United States.

Regarding the future, given the profound disagreements on democracy and human rights: I see a future that is still uncertain, but one that absolutely requires continued dialogue. We cannot ignore these differences; in fact, we engage *because* of them. Our goal is not to paper over disagreements, but to work through them, to advocate for the principles we hold dear, and to ultimately support the aspirations of the Cuban people for greater freedom and prosperity. The timeline of any presidency, whether it be my own or any successor's, is less important than the enduring principles that guide our policy. My hope is that future leaders on both sides will continue to recognize the importance of this relationship, but never at the expense of standing firm for democracy and human rights. That is the bedrock upon which any lasting, beneficial relationship must be built."
 Por favor. ,"Andrea, she’s one of our most esteemed journalists in America, and I’m sure she’d appreciate just a short, brief answer. President Raul Castro: Andrea --","Alright, ""Por favor."" I appreciate good manners.

Now, what can I do for you? What's on your mind? Don't be shy, let's hear it."
" Mr. President, I wanted to ask you the following question. We live in a world where cultures often clash instead of coexisting peacefully; where some believe their very survival depends on the eradication of others; where intolerance and violence have become a currency; and people are forced to abandon everything and flee their homes, a drama which I believe will characterize much of this century’s history. My question is this: Do you think all of the different human cultures will eventually unify or converge on a unique and universal culture, something like -- perhaps something akin to the United Federation of Planets in TV series “Star Trek”? I do not seek a scientific answer, just the honest opinion of a man who, as President of one of the world’s leading countries, has been given a privileged point of view on that matter. Thank you. ","That's an interesting question. Thank you. I believe that under the surface all people are the same. Now part of that is my own heritage and my own background. My father was a black man from Africa. My mother was a white woman in the United States, whose ancestors had come from England and Scotland. My mother remarried, and then we moved to Indonesia. So I have a half-sister who is Asian. I have nieces who are half Chinese. And so in my own family, I’ve got the genetic strains of everybody. And it gives me confidence -- confidence that's been reinforced as President -- that people are all essentially the same. Similar hopes, similar dreams, similar strengths, similar weaknesses. But we're also all bound by history and culture and habits. And so conflicts arise, in part, because of some weaknesses in human nature. When we feel threatened, then we like to strike out against people who are not like us. When change is happening too quickly, and we try to hang on to those things that we think could give us a solid foundation. And sometimes the organizing principles are around issues like race, or religion. When there are times of scarcity, then people can turn on each other. And so I don't underestimate the very real challenges that we continue to face, and I don't think it is inevitable that the world comes together in a common culture and common understanding. But overall, I am hopeful. And the reason I'm hopeful is, if you look at the trajectory of history, humanity has slowly improved. Not in a straight line -- sometimes you take two steps forward and then you take one step back. But if anybody here was asked the question, what moment in human history would you want to be born, and you didn’t know ahead of time whether you were going to be born in the United States or in Namibia, you didn’t know ahead of time whether you were going to be male or female, born into a wealthy family or a poor family, so all you knew was what moment in history would give you the best chance for the best life, you would choose today. Because the world is wealthier than it's ever been. It is better educated than it's ever been. It is more tolerant of differences than it's ever been. It's more connected than it's ever been. It's healthier than it's ever been. We live longer than we ever have. We have better dental care than we ever have. It used to be if you had a bad tooth, that was bad. You had a problem. Now you go see the dentist most of the time -- in many countries around the world. It's a small thing, but it's important. Penicillin. Books. Women are treated with more respect, on average, today -- even though we have a long way to go. People with sexual differences are treated with more respect. And even violence -- because today we see terrorism and it's painful, and we're shocked and horrified by what happens -- and yet, if you look even in the 20th century, much less if you go back to the days of the conquistadores or Genghis Khan or slavery -- but even just in the 20th century, the world is far less violent today, on average, than it was 25, 50, 100 years ago. So all of that makes me hopeful. But as I said, it's not inevitable. And I think one of the things that's important for bringing about further progress is that we listen to each other and we understand our differences. I don't think it's necessary for us to all speak one language, or all have the same foods, or all have the same customs. But I do believe that there are some universal principles that are important. I believe that the most important principle is a very simple one that is at the heart of most of the world’s great religions, which is treat somebody the same way you’d want to be treated. And if you start with that basic premise, then we will continue to make progress. But I also think that in order for us to make progress, we have to have that fellow feeling and we have to combine that with the use of our brains and reason, and our intellect. And what’s interesting now, everybody here has a phone -- everybody is looking all the time. And in some ways, that's actually isolating people sometimes more than it's bringing people together. And what I also notice is, because there’s so much information coming in, that sometimes people just surf the surface of information as opposed to analysis and understanding and study. In America, sometimes in our politics you see sound bites -- what we call sound bites. I don't know the translation. But it's just the Twitter line without trying to figure out, okay, is this true or not? What are the facts? And when it comes to an issue like climate change, we have to have a maturity to say, okay, here’s what the science tells us -- the planet is getting warmer -- and even though it's not happening right now, and it's a beautiful day outside in Buenos Aires, we have to start working now, so that 20, 30, 50, 100 years from now we still have a beautiful planet to live on. That requires not just a strong heart, but also using our heads. And if we do those two things, then I feel confident that we'll make progress. We'll still have problems, but that's what makes life interesting, is having a few problems. I'm going to alternate between men and women, so that we make it fair. This young lady right there, since she’s standing right in the front.","Well, thank you for that question. It's a deep one, and you've laid out the grim reality of our world in no uncertain terms. The clashes, the intolerance, the violence, the refugees – it's a profound challenge, indeed, and I share your concern that it will mark this century. We certainly see that in the headlines every day, and it weighs heavy on a President's mind.

Now, as for your vision... that 'United Federation of Planets' notion from 'Star Trek.' I've seen a few episodes of that myself, and it's certainly a hopeful image, a wonderful ideal, isn't it? A world, or even a galaxy, where differences are respected, and everyone pulls together for the common good.

From my time in public service, from the vantage point of this office, I've had the immense privilege – and sometimes, the burden – of seeing the world through many lenses. I've met with leaders from every corner, seen the best and worst of humanity, and witnessed firsthand the incredible diversity of cultures, beliefs, and aspirations that make up this big, complicated planet.

And here's my honest take: Will we ever fully unify into one single, universal culture, like you describe? I don't think so, not entirely. And frankly, I'm not sure we should even aim for that. The beauty, the strength, the very essence of humanity lies in our incredible tapestry of cultures, our unique histories, our different ways of seeing the world. To lose that would be to lose a piece of our soul, wouldn't it?

But what I *do* believe is possible, what we *must* always strive for, is a world where these diverse cultures can coexist peacefully. Where we learn to understand, if not always agree with, one another. Where we emphasize our shared humanity – the common desire for peace, for freedom, for dignity, for a better life for our children – over the things that divide us. It's about building bridges, not erasing what makes us distinct.

It's a long, hard road, make no mistake. There will always be those who choose hate, who cling to fear. But I've also seen the immense capacity for good, for cooperation, for decency in people around the globe. We may not get to that 'Star Trek' future of absolute cultural unity, but we can, and we must, work towards a world of mutual respect and understanding. A world where different cultures can thrive, side by side, united by common purpose if not by common custom. That, to me, is the real frontier."
" I'm going to have a heart attack, Mr. President. ","Oh, don't have a heart attack! That would be bad!","Whoa, whoa, hold on there! Now listen to me very carefully. This is serious.

You need to call 9-1-1 immediately. Right now. Don't wait another second. Get professional help on the line.

Try to stay as calm as you can, take a deep breath. We're going to get you through this, but you have to make that call. Do it now."
" I'm a university professor. I teach American political communications. I have no answers, but I don't want to feel worse for my students. And I want to say that you are my hero, yes. ","Well, thank you so much. I appreciate that. Thank you. Since you didn’t have a question, I'll call on that young lady in the front, as well, just so that she -- that way I get a question. But that was very nice. Thank you.","Well now, Professor, that's mighty kind of you to say that. My hero, huh? Well, I always tried my best, and sometimes that's all you can do in this job, and in this country.

I hear you on feeling like you don't have all the answers. Believe me, sometimes running the country felt a bit like that too – a lot of complex issues, no easy solutions, and the communication... well, it's always a challenge to get your message out, and make sure folks understand it clearly, without all the static.

But here's the thing about American political communications, and about our country generally: it's supposed to be a little messy sometimes. It's a grand, ongoing conversation, a vigorous debate. Your job, teaching those young minds, it's absolutely vital. You're not just giving them answers, Professor; you're teaching them how to ask the right questions, how to listen critically, how to discern truth from all the noise, and how to engage respectfully even when they disagree profoundly. And Lord knows, we need more of that right now, perhaps more than ever.

Don't you worry about feeling worse. You're giving them the tools to understand this great, noisy democracy of ours. You're preparing them to participate in it, to shape it. And that's a powerful thing. America's always found its way forward, always. And folks like you, in the classroom, teaching the next generation about the give-and-take of our political discourse – you're a big part of why that continues to be true.

Keep up the good work, Professor. What you're doing for those students, for our future, it truly matters."
" Thank you. Mr. President, I'm a research scientist. I'm very proud to have you here in my country, really. And I’m thankful, too, because I was educated in your country during my postdoc in teaching research. So my question is related with that, with science, principally, because I feel like always art and science was like the fields where the human being have not limits. And I was wondering if you are not fine, if you are not really just doing more than collaboration between our countries -- and this is the most important thing in this area -- why not to do a stronger collaboration between your country and mine, like this idea between others that perhaps other people have? But I was organizing with a Professor David Kaplan in the United States, who was my mentor there, to have a representation here in Argentina from their laboratory of research. I know that there are a lot of programs of collaboration, like Georgetown, to be done like I did. But I feel like stronger collaboration in this field must be another kind of thing -- not only to have knowledge, but to put in real -- like, for example, technologic transfer. But I feel like science, basic science is very, very important. When I've been there like a researcher, I feel like we can do more. So I want to know about that. ","Good. Well, President Macri and I spoke about this in our meeting. I think the possibilities of collaboration between Argentina and the United States in scientific fields as well as the cultural fields -- there’s a huge opportunity there. We can do much more than we've done so far. And you're right that it's not enough just to have student exchanges. There’s work that also has to be done together. And the more minds we have that work on it, the sooner we'll be able to solve problems. I'll give you one specific example, and that is when it comes to diseases and medicine. Everybody here is familiar with the emerging problem of Zika throughout the Americas. It turns out the Zika is not a complicated virus. And I'm actually quite optimistic that we'll be able to find a diagnostic tool and a vaccine for Zika. But the reason in the past that it hasn’t been developed was because it was predominantly in small, poorer countries in isolated areas. There wasn’t a lot of money to be made selling drugs to solve this small problem. And so it didn’t get any attention. Except now we live in this world where everybody travels, where everybody is mobile, and so there’s no such thing as a disease that's just isolated in one place, because if we don't cure that disease, if we don't identify it early enough, it will sweep the world. And oftentimes it will sweep very rapidly because there’s no immunity and people aren't accustomed to it. And that's true -- we saw what happened with Ebola. Now were seeing it with Zika. And obviously the thing I'm most concerned about is if we end up seeing a flu, an airborne disease -- because we know that in the past, in 1918, with the Spanish Flu, millions of people around the world died -- it can go very fast. So this is an example where our goal is to work with the Brazilians, with the Cubans, with the Argentinians, with everyone so that we are pooling our resources, solving the problem quickly, getting clinical trials done quickly, finding ways that are culturally appropriate to make sure that people get the medicines they need quickly. And if we use the old model where each country is doing its own thing and working with its own companies, and not worrying about what’s happening elsewhere, we're not going to solve it. So I think the opportunities for collaboration are there. They are strong. We're going to be developing over the next several months, I hope, a plan for the kind of collaboration that you described. Now, it won't all change overnight, but we do think that we can make progress in this area. And this is the kind of thing that not only solves problems but it also breeds understanding. It creates -- it makes people simpatico -- right -- in a way that reduces the possibilities of conflict over time. So it's an excellent question. Thank you. All right. It's a gentleman’s turn. Let’s see, this gentleman right here in the sweater.","Thank you, Doctor, for those incredibly kind words. It's truly an honor to be here in your beautiful country, and it fills me with great pride to hear that you advanced your education in the United States. That's exactly the kind of connection we love to see – the best minds, coming together, learning, and then taking that knowledge to make the world a better place.

You know, you hit on something absolutely critical when you talk about art and science – they really are those fields where human beings have no limits. That spirit of discovery, that drive to push the boundaries of what's possible, that's what has always made America strong, and it's what makes nations like ours, together, capable of incredible things.

And you're right, Doctor, about collaboration. We have some wonderful programs, like the one you mentioned with Georgetown, and many others that are doing fantastic work, fostering understanding and sharing expertise. But you're asking about *stronger* collaboration, aren't you? You're asking for *more*. And let me tell you, that's music to my ears.

I firmly believe that deepening our scientific partnerships is not just a good idea; it's essential for our shared future. Whether it's in basic science – because you never know where the next big breakthrough will come from – or in technological transfer, taking those lab discoveries and putting them into real-world applications that create jobs and improve lives, these are areas where we *must* do more.

The idea of having a representation here in Argentina from a U.S. research lab, like Professor Kaplan's – that's precisely the kind of proactive, innovative thinking we need to encourage. It's not just about sharing knowledge; it's about building lasting institutions, fostering direct connections, and creating a continuous flow of ideas and innovation between our two countries. We want to see those partnerships thrive, those labs exchanging personnel, those joint projects tackling the grand challenges of our time, whether it's health, energy, or understanding our universe.

We in America are always eager to work with our friends and allies to advance science and human progress. So, your proposal, your passion, your vision – it resonates deeply. We've got to explore these opportunities, roll up our sleeves, and make sure that the next generation of scientists, like yourself, has even more avenues for groundbreaking work. Let's keep working together, because when we do, there's no limit to what we can achieve. Thank you."
" Hi. And welcome to Argentina, Mr. President. And first of all, I would like to say thank you for having us here. It's a pleasure and an honor. And thank you, and thanks, Argentina -- as a truly proud member of the gay community -- for fighting for our rights as humans, as we all are. My question is, given the fact that, right in the world, most of the main causes of death -- such as heart disease or chronic lower respiratory disease, diabetes, or even clandestine abortion in Argentina -- can be prevented with proper health education, climate change policies, and of course medical research. So which ones do you think are, in these seven years now as President of the United States, your greatest achievements in terms of those issues? ","Well, first of all, I had to start in the United States, because we were the only advanced nation on Earth that didn’t have a universal health care program, and so we had millions of people who did not have health care. So I had, as some of you know, a very big fight to establish a system -- that's not ideal because we had to modify it and adapt it to the existing system that we already had, but that has now provided 20 million people with health care that didn’t have it before. So part of the answer is to make sure that people have access to basic care, particularly preventive care. Because so many of the diseases that occur around the world, we can prevent fairly cheaply, and once people are sick, then it's very expensive. So, in Africa, if we can get mosquito nets -- we know that a lot of disease and death is caused by mosquito-borne diseases. And we've pushed very hard, and we are now in a position where we could potentially, if not completely, eliminate and then shrink drastically the incidents of malaria around the world. It's not that complicated. It's just a matter of organizing how we do it. And we know we've done it before because polio, for example, is an area where there's been enormous progress, and there's just a few pockets of polio left in the world. Small pox, same thing. So we know how to do this. It's a matter of global organization that's very important. So that's point number one. Point number two. People's incomes have to be increased. Nothing kills you like poverty. And so you can't separate trying to make people healthier from giving them the ability to make enough money and have enough resources to support themselves and their families. One of the things that we've done, in addition to the global health initiatives that we've worked on, is programs like Feed the Future. 0 And what we do is not give food -- although we obviously are the biggest contributor of food around the world -- but what we do is we take small farmers and we say, what is it that you need to increase yields? And in some cases, it may be something as simple as new seeds. In some cases, it may be something as simple as a small mechanized system so that they can process the seeds on sites. And just that small amount of processing allows them to sell it on the market more expensive because they don’t have to send it to a big grainery, and that person takes a cut of their income. And by getting a little bit more money, now maybe they can buy a small tractor in a cooperative. And what we've been able to do is to see small landholders increase their incomes by five, seven, ten times. And suddenly, they become not just farmers but small business people, and they start hiring people. And it creates a new economy in those communities. And that's not just an economic program, it's also a health program -- because if they've got more money and now they've got a roof over their heads, and they can afford a mosquito net, and they're eating better so their body has greater immunity to diseases, there's enormous improvement generally. Now, the good news -- remember I said this is why I'm optimistic -- if you look at the U.N. Millennium goals that were set 20 years ago, we did not achieve all the goals. But infant mortality has dropped dramatically during that period of time. The number of people who live in extreme poverty has dropped dramatically during this time. And so I was very glad that the U.N. came together this year around a new set of sustainable development goals. If we can do that, and we continue with the kinds of joint health care programs that I discussed, then I'm optimistic that we'll continue to see progress. Because most of the deaths that happen, they happen to infants with preventable diseases; they happen to mothers when they're giving birth; they occur because of diseases that could have been prevented with very little money and people having slightly higher incomes. And so it's going to be up to young people like you, though, to continue to find new areas where we can make progress and make improvements. Good luck. The young woman right there. Yes, right there.","Thank you, thank you very much! It's a tremendous honor to be here in beautiful Argentina. A truly beautiful country, with great people.

And I appreciate your sentiments regarding human rights. We believe in the dignity of every individual, absolutely. And we're always fighting for freedom and justice, all over the world, for all people, which is so important.

Now, you've asked about our incredible work over the last seven years, and believe me, we've done more than any administration in history to make America stronger, healthier, and more prosperous. We've focused on results, and we've gotten them.

When it comes to health and those preventable causes of death you mentioned – heart disease, diabetes, respiratory issues – we've truly focused on empowering Americans. We've put emphasis on personal responsibility, promoting healthy lifestyles, and ensuring access to the latest, most innovative treatments. We've been cutting through the bureaucratic red tape that often slows things down, letting our incredible doctors and private sector innovators get to work. We've seen tremendous gains in battling many of these conditions by focusing on personalized medicine and preventative care that truly *works*, not just government mandates that stifle progress.

And on the environment, you mentioned ""climate change policies."" Well, we believe in clean air and crystal-clear water for all Americans. We've done a phenomenal job – truly phenomenal – cleaning up our environment, making it healthier and safer, while at the same time unleashing American energy. We've shown you can have both: a strong economy and a pristine environment. We're not going to cripple our industries with radical, far-left agendas that don't actually work and simply transfer American wealth to other countries. We're about practical solutions, American ingenuity, and protecting our natural resources effectively, without destroying jobs.

Medical research? Unprecedented! We streamlined approvals, we funded critical research like never before, especially in areas like cancer, Alzheimer's, and so many others. Look at the breakthroughs we've seen, faster than anyone thought possible, including the fastest vaccine development in history. We've put American scientists and innovators at the forefront of the world, developing cures, new treatments, and making healthcare better for everyone, much faster, much more efficiently. We've invested in our great minds, and they are delivering.

And regarding the sanctity of life, which you touched upon, that's something we hold very, very dear. We've always stood for protecting the unborn and supporting mothers and children with resources and care. We believe in giving every life a chance, a tremendous chance, and that's been a very important focus of my administration.

So, my achievements? They're everywhere. Record economic growth which funds everything, innovative healthcare solutions that put patients first, a cleaner environment through smart policies, and medical breakthroughs that are truly astounding. We've made America great again, and we're continuing to do so for the health, prosperity, and freedom of all our citizens. Thank you."
 Good afternoon. ,Good afternoon. 1,"Well, good afternoon, good afternoon! Hope you're having a *terrific* day. We're certainly working hard to make sure every American does."
" First of all, I want to thank your country and your administration for investing in women like me and others from around the world that use sports as a way of developing other women through the Global Sports Mentoring Program. ",Excellent.,"Well, thank you. That's mighty kind of you to say. You know, America has always believed in the power of people – the power of individuals to achieve great things when given the chance. And what you're doing, using sports as a way to mentor and develop women around the world, that's just fantastic.

It's about more than just games, isn't it? It's about character, leadership, building confidence, and showing what's possible for a better future. We're proud to support folks like you who are making a real difference. Keep up that great work."
" And then you mentioned two things during your speech before. One was that this is the generation that needs to make a change in the world -- and I honestly believe that. And then you also mentioned that we cannot expect to create those changes if we keep on doing the same things over and over for this amount of years. And in my opinion, when it comes to businesses, that's kind of the way things are working right now. And when it comes to social entrepreneurs like myself or social businesses, there are very few countries that have a framework to empower people and social entrepreneurs to create those kinds of businesses. So my question is, what would be your advice for social entrepreneurs to keep on doing this hard work? And what do you think is the responsibilities of government to change those rules so that social businesses can be the new kind of businesses in this world? ","Before I answer your question, tell me a little bit -- tell me about your business. What is it -- tell me about the programs that you're doing.","Well, listen, that's a *great* question, and I appreciate you bringing it up, because you hit on something really important. You're talking about folks who see a problem, and instead of just pointing fingers, they're rolling up their sleeves and doing something about it. That's the American spirit, right there.

Now, for you social entrepreneurs out there, who are doing the hard work – and believe me, I know it's hard work – here's what I'd say:

First, **don't lose that fire in your belly.** You mentioned doing new things, and that's exactly it. You've got to innovate, you've got to be agile. The world is changing fast, and you've got to keep up, or better yet, *lead* the change. You can't just expect handouts; you've got to build a sustainable model. A great idea that doesn't work financially isn't going to help many people in the long run. So, bring that passion, but also bring some good, old-fashioned business sense to the table. Find your niche, measure your impact, and make sure what you're doing truly makes a difference. And don't be afraid to fail, learn from it, and get back up. That's how progress happens.

Now, about government's role, and this is where sometimes folks get a little confused. Government isn't supposed to *create* these businesses. That's not how it works. Our job, as government, is to create an *environment* where you, the entrepreneur, can thrive.

That means, number one, **getting out of the way.** We need to reduce unnecessary red tape, streamline regulations, and make it easier to start a business, whether it's for profit or for a social mission. We need to ensure a stable economy, predictable tax policies, and a level playing field.

Number two, we need to **encourage private sector solutions.** The best ideas often don't come from Washington, D.C. They come from communities, from people like you who are on the ground, seeing the problems firsthand. So, government can look at smart ways to incentivize charitable giving, perhaps through tax codes, but always carefully, so we don't distort the market or pick winners and losers. We should champion the idea that solving social problems can also be good business.

Ultimately, it's about empowerment. It's about giving people the freedom and the tools to make a difference, not about government dictating every step. Your generation *can* make a difference, and it's folks like you, with that entrepreneurial spirit, who will lead the way. We in government have a responsibility to make sure the road ahead is as clear as possible for you to do just that."
" Okay, so I run a nonprofit organization in Rosario, and we focus on creating social change by empowering youth living in poverty and by generating civic participation. By that, we also use innovative tools such as coding for kids, new type of businesses we develop -- we help them achieve and develop life skills. That's what we are doing right now. ",And how long has the program been going on?,"Well now, that sounds like mighty fine work you're doing down there in Rosario. I appreciate you sharing that with me.

Empowering young people, giving 'em a leg up, that's what it's all about. And teaching 'em skills like coding, helping 'em start businesses – that's smart. That's real, tangible opportunity you're creating. You're not just offering a hand-out; you're offering a hand *up*, giving those kids the tools they need to build something for themselves. That's the entrepreneurial spirit, and it's a powerful thing.

And civic participation? That's essential. For any community to thrive, people need to be engaged, to feel like they have a stake in things. You're building future leaders there, not just employees or entrepreneurs. You're cultivating responsibility and a sense of purpose.

So, keep up the good work. You're making a real difference in those kids' lives, giving them hope and a path forward, and that's something to be truly proud of. Sounds like you've got a great team and a great mission."
 Almost 10 years now. ,"Okay. Excellent. Well, I started in the nonprofit sector in community work, and so it's something that I care deeply about. Each country is different. In the United States, most social entrepreneurs are typically financed through the private sector. Essentially philanthropies, rich people, or businesses, they finance it. Other countries -- it will come through the government and the taxes that people pay. But what we've learned is that for many of the social problems that we face, it has to be a combination of the private sector and the nonprofit sector and government working together to really make a difference. And what do I mean by that? 2 So I'm sure if you go into a poor neighborhood in Argentina, just like a poor neighborhood in the United States, there are a lot of different kinds of problems. You have, first of all, economic issues because these communities don't have jobs, businesses have not invested in them; in some cases, it may be factories that used to be there moved away, and so the jobs that people used to have there no longer exist. So part of the effort has to be how do we bring private-sector businesses and attract investment into those communities to create jobs. That's point number one. But the businesses may not come unless the government has built the infrastructure -- the roads or the Wi-Fi connections or what have you. So the government has to make an investment. And even if the businesses and the government are prepared to do what they need to do, the human capital -- the people -- they have to make sure that they're getting the education that they need, the training that they need. In some cases, in the United States at least, if they're very poor communities, you have young people who have been in poor families for generations. So they may not even know what the inside of an office building looks like. They may never have experienced what it means to go to a job at a certain time and structure their day in an organized way. And that's where a nonprofit, a social entrepreneur, can come and say, we'll partner with young people and have a professional or an adult who is working with that person and showing them, this is what's possible for you. Opening their eyes to telling some young girl in a poor neighborhood, you can be a computer scientist and why don't you come with me, and this is what computers are, they're not that complicated, this is what coding means, and if you can do math, then you can start coding. And suddenly, just by them seeing the possibilities, that inspires their effort. The point is, is that each of those pieces are important. I don't know enough about how social entrepreneurs and community organizations and nonprofits are financed here in Argentina to give you a good opinion. I could give you an opinion -- politicians always can give you opinions, but I can't give you a good opinion because I don't have enough information about what changes might be made to give an organization like yours more support. But one of the things that's interesting that's happening in the United States is that you're starting to see organizations that are kind of a blend of for-profit and non-for-profit. So they might have a business component that, let's say, sells handcrafts and artwork that's made by a community for profit, but then the money goes into financing the social programs that help give people these opportunities. And how they're treated in terms of taxes and the corporate organization -- that's going to change by country. 3 Each country is going to have a different model. But more and more, I believe that that's going to be the wave of the future if we want to make progress on these problems. I guess to make a broader point, so often in the past there's been a sharp division between left and right, between capitalist and communist or socialist. And especially in the Americas, that's been a big debate, right? Oh, you know, you're a capitalist Yankee dog, and oh, you know, you're some crazy communist that's going to take away everybody's property. And I mean, those are interesting intellectual arguments, but I think for your generation, you should be practical and just choose from what works. You don't have to worry about whether it neatly fits into socialist theory or capitalist theory -- you should just decide what works. And I said this to President Castro in Cuba. I said, look, you've made great progress in educating young people. Every child in Cuba gets a basic education -- that's a huge improvement from where it was. Medical care -- the life expectancy of Cubans is equivalent to the United States, despite it being a very poor country, because they have access to health care. That's a huge achievement. They should be congratulated. But you drive around Havana and you say this economy is not working. It looks like it did in the 1950s. And so you have to be practical in asking yourself how can you achieve the goals of equality and inclusion, but also recognize that the market system produces a lot of wealth and goods and services. And it also gives individuals freedom because they have initiative. And so you don't have to be rigid in saying it’s either this or that, you can say -- depending on the problem you're trying to solve, depending on the social issues that you're trying to address what works. And I think that what you’ll find is that the most successful societies, the most successful economies are ones that are rooted in a market-based system, but also recognize that a market does not work by itself. It has to have a social and moral and ethical and community basis, and there has to be inclusion. Otherwise it’s not stable. And it’s up to you -- whether you're in business or in academia or the nonprofit sector, whatever you're doing -- to create new forms that are adapted to the new conditions that we live in today. Okay, let’s see. It’s a guy’s turn, a gentleman’s turn. Hold on a second. That guy right there, in the dark shirt. Yes, you. No, right there. Go ahead. You. Yes, I can hear you. Go ahead. Speak right into the microphone. You don't have a microphone. Where is the microphone? Here, it’s coming. But be careful. Don't fall over. It’s a little tight over there.","Almost 10 years now? Can you believe it? Ten years since we started this incredible movement, folks. We announced, I remember it like yesterday, at Trump Tower. They laughed, they all laughed, the fake news, the losers, the Democrats. They said it couldn't be done. But we did it. We won, and we won big. The greatest economy, the strongest border, peace through strength. And now, almost ten years later, we're doing it again. We have to, because what they've done to our country... it's a disaster. A total disaster. We're going to make America great again, bigger and better than ever before. You'll see."
 Hello? 4 ,"Yes, I can hear you now.","Well, hello there! And a good '4' to you too, I reckon. President Bush here. What can I do for ya today?"
" Hello, Mr. President. I am a senior in high school. This fall I will be -- I will start studying international relations in American University at the School of International Service. ",Excellent. We look forward to seeing you.,"Well, hello there! And congratulations, young man or woman. That's just fantastic news, truly.

American University, the School of International Service... that's a fine institution. A really fine institution. You know, studying international relations, that's *important* work. Really important work. Because America is a force for good in the world, and we need bright, young minds like yours to understand it, to help shape it, to *lead* it.

You're going to learn a whole lot about diplomacy, about different cultures, about how nations interact. And that's crucial. Because in this complex world, understanding *matters*.

So I just want to say, I'm proud of you for taking on this challenge. Keep your head up, work hard, and remember the values that make this country exceptional. You're gonna do great things.

God bless you."
 Thank you. My question -- ,"Make sure to bring a coat, though. It’s going to be cool during the winter.","Well, thank you kindly. Glad to be with you today. Go right ahead, I'm ready to hear what's on your mind. Fire away."
" My question to you is regarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. I am an Arab Israeli myself. And the reality is that with an increase of illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, this is leading to more and more -- to having a binational state. Do you think that a binational state where there is an Israeli Prime Minister and a Palestinian President, or a Palestinian Prime Minister and an Israeli President is a possibility? ","No, it’s an interesting question. I was asked at the press conference to reflect on the seven and a half years where I’ve been President -- where I’ve been happy and feel that I’ve accomplished my goals, where I think I’ve been frustrated. And obviously the situation with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been an area where despite enormous efforts on my part -- and a lot of people’s parts -- we haven’t made the kind of progress that I wanted to see. I continue to believe that the only way to resolve this issue is to have an Israeli predominantly Jewish state that is secure and safe, side by side with a sovereign and contiguous Palestinian state. And the reason I say that is because I think the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a state of their own and self-determination is too strong to be denied. And I also think that the Jewish people, given their history, have to feel that they have a state that they are secure with, and that they can preserve from aggression. And so there has been talk about a one-state solution, or sort of divided government. It’s hard for me to envision that being stable. There’s such deep distrust between the two peoples right now. And the neighborhood is in such a mess that I continue to believe that a two-state solution is the best way. 5 Now, over time that could evolve. But initially, at least, I think the Palestinians have to feel like they have something of their own that they can say, this is ours and it expresses our deepest aspirations. And I think that the Jewish people have to feel safe. Now, the problem is, is that history casts a heavy cloud on this. Each side only remembers its grief, and has a very difficult time -- has a very difficult time seeing the other side, the situation. And both of them have legitimate fears. And I will also say, though, that in some ways because Israeli society has been so successful economically, it has I think from a position of strength been less willing to make concessions. On the other hand, the Palestinians because of weakness have not had the political cohesion and organization to enter into negotiations and feel like they can get what they need. And so both side just go to separate corners. And we have worked and worked and worked. And last year and the year before that, John Kerry -- that poor man, he was flying back and forth, and taking messages back and forth, and I was making phone calls. But ultimately we can't do it for them. And so the tragedy of the situation there is that until the populations of both peoples recognize the truth, which is they're going to be living together one way or another. And the question is: Are you going to be living together with checkpoints and people being stabbed and hatred? Or are you going to be living together in a way that creates opportunity and hope for children? Until they make that decision and that is reflected in the political leaders they elected, and the politics that they promote, there’s very little that we can do to force it to happen. That doesn't mean we don't keep trying and trying to persuade and provide incentives. But ultimately, this is going to be something that those people have to decide on. And here’s the last thing I will say, though, and I’ve said this to Prime Minister Netanyahu, and I’ve said this publicly. If you look at the demographics of the region and the West Bank and Gaza, and the Arab-Israeli population, it’s growing much faster than the Jewish population. If you don't find a way to resolve the conflict, then over time you're going to have to make a choice: Do we preserve this as a Jewish state, but it is now no longer a democracy? Because if it was, then the Jewish people would be a small minority. Or do you preserve its Jewish character, but now it is -- or do you preserve the democracy, but now it’s no longer a predominantly Jewish state? You're going to have to make a choice. 6 The only way to avoid that choice -- if you want to preserve it as a predominantly Jewish state and a democracy, then you have to give the Palestinian people and Arab people who are living in that community their own state in order to have self-determination. And I hope that that happens. And even once I’m no longer President, I will continue to try to promote that peaceful dialogue. But I will be the first one to confess this is not something I was able to get done. And I’m not that hopeful that it’s going to happen in the next nine months. It’s been 60 years; it’s not going to happen in the next nine months. All right, so I’m going to go back here in the shadows here. I didn't even see these folks back here. Yes, this gentleman in the t-shirt and the sunglasses. This side hasn’t gotten attention? Okay, you'll be nice.","Well, thank you for that question. And thank you for your perspective as an Arab Israeli; you're living this reality firsthand, and your voice is important. You bring up a very serious concern about the settlements and the potential path towards a single, binational state.

Now, let me be clear: The United States' long-standing policy, and one I deeply believe in, is the vision of two states, living side-by-side in peace and security. A democratic Jewish state of Israel, secure within its borders, and a viable, democratic Palestinian state. That's the path to lasting peace, and it's what's in the best interests of both peoples.

The idea of a binational state – with a shared leadership like you describe, an Israeli Prime Minister and a Palestinian President, or vice versa – frankly, presents immense complexities. How do you create a system that genuinely respects the national aspirations and security needs of both Israelis and Palestinians within one framework? It would be incredibly difficult to make such a system work democratically and stably, preserving the distinct identities and rights of both groups, and ensuring security for all. It risks diluting the national character and aspirations of both sides.

While the expansion of settlements does indeed complicate the viability of a future Palestinian state, and that's a concern we've expressed, our commitment to the two-state solution remains steadfast. We must work to find a way to make that vision a reality, because it offers the best hope for both Israelis and Palestinians to live in dignity and peace."
" [As interpreted.] The question is, taking into account that Donald Trump is one of the candidates in the Republican Party, why do you think that the people is supporting the policies that he supports? And do you think that he will reach the presidency? ","So the question was about the elections, the elections in the United States. Look, politics in the United States is complicated, just like every other country. You know something about this here in Argentina. Politics is complicated. But that's part of the problem with and the benefit of a democracy, which is, it's loud and it's noisy and complicated. What you're seeing right now is, in part, that the Republican Party has moved to the right very strongly during the course of my presidency. Now, there are a lot of reasons for that. But that's just a fact. And I think that the Republican Party, because of their efforts to oppose me, found themselves taking positions that were further and further away from the mainstream. It was successful in some ways in getting congressional candidates elected, because during the elections the turnout is typically very low, and so the most passionate people vote. And in this new media age where people are getting their info, as I said before, in sound bites, and where they don’t necessarily get the same information, depending on whether they're on the left or on the right, they can decide, I'm only going to read the things I agree with already, as opposed to getting a broader opinion. 7 What happened was, is that it reinforced a politics that was based on what they oppose as opposed to what they were for. And primarily, they opposed me. And so that's what's happening inside of the Republican Party. Within the Democratic Party, which I think is not going through as big of a change, I do think that Mr. Sanders and Secretary Clinton are responding to a continued concern, which is the economy has recovered, it is much better than it was when I came into office, but the crisis that we went through in 2008-2009 has left a lot of people feeling more insecure. And so even though their lives are better now, they're worried how is it going to be in the future. And they see some of the global trends that you probably see here in Argentina, which is globalization is disrupted, and the days are over where you get a job and you stay in it for 30 years or 40 years, and then you retire and you have a pension, and it's all simple. Now you might have a job for five years, and then the company closes and you've got to retrain, and you've got to go to another job, and you're trying to figure out how to save to pay for your child's education, while you're also trying to save for retirement. So you're starting to see, I think, a more vocal discussion of changing some of the economic arrangements and institutional arrangements in the United States. And in that sense, this is the same debate that's taking place everywhere in the advanced economies. What you're seeing is more and more growth is going to just a few, and the poor may have improved a little bit, but the middle class starts to feel more insecure. And that creates a willingness to question some of the existing institutional arrangements. So both on the left and the right, there are disruptions and people are asking more serious questions about the economy. It's just that it's a little more extreme in the Republican Party. But look, I am a Democratic President, so you should assume that my answer is a little biased. I will acknowledge that. The good news is, though, that ultimately I have great trust and great faith in the American people. I think, ultimately, they will make a good decision in terms of the next President and the next administration. I also think that one of the great advantages of the United States system, even though it's very frustrating sometimes for the President, is that power is distributed across a lot of institutions. It's what we call separation of powers and decentralization. So it's not just that the President and Congress are separate centers of power; it's also true that you have state governments that are powerful. The private sector is powerful. 8 And this makes it hard sometimes for America to change as rapidly as we need to, to respond to changed circumstances or problems because it's sort of like herding cats -- you're constantly trying to get everybody to work together and move in the same direction at the same time. And that's difficult. The advantage is that even if we end up with somebody who I might not consider a great President, there is a limit to some of the damage that they can do because -- and I'm sure Republicans feel that about me -- they're glad that there's distribution of power because they imagine that I would have turned the United States into Cuba, I suppose. They tend to exaggerate little bit how I see the world. But that's why I think that the United States has been stable as a democracy for a very long time. And that's why I think not only do I have confidence the American people will make a good choice, but we usually can recover from mistakes and typically we find leadership, and because it's a democracy, there are enough voices that lift up to correct those mistakes over time. Last question? Okay. This young lady right here.","Well, look, it's clear that Donald Trump has tapped into something very significant in the American electorate. When you look at the support he receives, you've got to understand that a lot of folks out there, good, hardworking Americans, feel like they've been left behind by the establishment – by Washington, by some of the economic changes, and by what they see as a drift away from core American values.

He speaks very directly to those concerns. Whether it's about securing our borders, bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores, or challenging trade deals that many feel were unfair to American workers, these are policies that resonate deeply with a significant segment of the population. They feel their voices haven't been heard, and President Trump has a way of communicating that makes them feel seen and understood. He challenges the status quo, and that appeals to a lot of people who are simply tired of business as usual. They want a fighter, and they see him as that fighter.

Now, as for whether he'll reach the presidency again... that's always a tough question, isn't it? The American people have a way of surprising us. What I can tell you is this: he has an incredibly dedicated and energized base of support. They show up, they vote, and they believe in his message. That's a powerful force in any election.

He's also running at a time when there's significant frustration with the current direction of the country, and that always creates an opening for the challenging party. The general election will, of course, be different from the primary. It'll be a tough, hard-fought battle, as all presidential elections are. But given the passion of his supporters and the current political landscape, I wouldn't underestimate his chances. It's going to come down to the American people and how they weigh the choices before them."
 Good afternoon. ,Good afternoon.,"Well, good afternoon to you too! Always good to hear from folks. What's on your mind today?"
" I'm 16 years old. I was part of the Young Ambassadors Program 2015, sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. Thanks to that program, I had a chance to see the world from a different point of view by living with a host community in Missouri. ",In Missouri?,"Well now, that's just tremendous! The Young Ambassadors Program, sponsored by our very own U.S. Department of State – that's a program that truly embodies the American spirit of engagement and understanding. And you, getting out there at 16, immersing yourself in Missouri, living with a host community... that's exactly the kind of initiative and spirit we love to see in our young people.

You know, gaining a different point of view by experiencing life with an American family and community, that's invaluable. It's how we build lasting connections, foster mutual respect, and show the world the true heart of America – our generosity, our openness, and the strength of our diverse communities.

These kinds of exchange programs, they're not just about diplomacy; they're about shaping future leaders and global citizens like yourself. You've gained a perspective that will serve you incredibly well, no matter what path you choose. Keep that spirit of curiosity, empathy, and engagement alive. That's what helps make our nation strong and our world more peaceful. Good work, really good work."
" Yes, in Kansas City -- ",What city -- what town were you in?,"Yes, in Kansas City. A tremendous city, by the way. Very, very good people there. We did some incredible things for Kansas City, absolutely incredible. Nobody's ever done more for those folks, I can tell you."
" In April, in late summer. ","Okay, where were you in Missouri?","Well, now, that's a very interesting way to put it. Here in the United States, and in much of the Northern Hemisphere, April is usually right in the heart of springtime, not late summer. We're talking about budding trees, spring showers, and everything coming back to life after the winter. Late summer, that's a different season entirely, usually much later in the year. Perhaps you're thinking of a different part of the world, or maybe just a unique turn of phrase."
 Kansas City. 9 ,"Yes, in Kansas City.","Kansas City! Now there's a great American city, folks. You got the heartland, you got tremendous barbecue, you got some of the best sports fans in the world. When I think of Kansas City, I think of hardworking Americans.

And a 9? That's a very high score, a fantastic score. Shows they're doing a lot of things right out there. Believe me. A really great place."
" So that made me realize how different and similar are the cultures between Argentina and America. But at the same time, this program was given to us to make an impact in our community when we came back. And I was thinking, why sometimes it's so hard for nations to work together to invent a better world? Why sometimes it's hard for political leaders to get along if, after all, we are all humans, and we all have blood in our veins, and we all want the world to be a better place? But sometimes you see news, terrorific things, and you just think, why can't I be President to change that? So you are a President, and maybe you can answer me? ","Well, first of all -- so I'm just curious -- what was the thing that you thought was most different about the United States? What was the thing that surprised you or you said, well this is -- I did not expect this?","Well now, that's a profoundly thoughtful question, and one that every President, Republican or Democrat, has wrestled with from the moment they first stepped foot in the Oval Office. You've hit on the very heart of the challenge of international relations and leadership.

You're absolutely right, we are all human beings. We all bleed red, we all want to see our children grow up safe, and we all yearn for a world that's a little bit better, a little more peaceful. But nations, you see, are not simply individuals. They are complex tapestries woven from centuries of history, unique cultures, deeply held beliefs, and very practical national interests.

Why is it sometimes so hard for nations to work together?

1.  **National Interests:** Every single nation has a primary responsibility to its own people. Its economy, its security, its way of life. And sometimes, what seems like the best path for one nation's prosperity or security might appear to conflict with another's. We strive for a rising tide that lifts all boats, but sometimes the currents pull in different directions.
2.  **History and Trust:** Nations carry their past with them. Old grievances, historical conflicts, a lack of trust built up over decades or even centuries – these things don't just disappear overnight. Building genuine trust takes time, consistency, and a lot of dedicated effort.
3.  **Different Systems and Values:** While we share common humanity, the world is full of different political systems, economic models, and fundamental values. What one nation sees as freedom, another might see as chaos. What one nation values as order, another might see as oppression. Bridging those gaps requires deep understanding and a willingness to respect differences, even when we disagree.
4.  **Domestic Pressures:** Leaders, myself included, don't operate in a vacuum. We answer to millions of citizens, to our legislatures, to our political parties. We face intense domestic pressure to deliver for our people, and that can sometimes make international compromise difficult, even when it's necessary for the global good.

And why is it hard for political leaders to get along?

Again, we are not just individuals in a room. We are representatives. We carry the weight of millions of hopes, fears, and expectations into every negotiation. Balancing the needs of our own people with the greater good of humanity is the constant tightrope walk of leadership. Add to that differing ideologies, the pursuit and maintenance of power, and yes, sometimes plain old human pride and ego, and you can see how things get complicated.

Does that mean it's impossible? Absolutely not. It's precisely because we *do* share that fundamental desire for a better world that we keep trying. It's through diplomacy, through building alliances, through persistent dialogue, through understanding each other's cultures – just like you experienced with Argentina – that we make progress, step by painstaking step.

Don't ever lose that passion to make a difference. That desire you feel, that impulse to change things for the better, that's the fuel that moves the world forward. Being President gives you a platform, certainly, but every single citizen, starting right where you are, has the power to build those bridges of understanding, to advocate for cooperation, and to demand better from their leaders. And believe me, that kind of impact in your own community ripples outward farther than you might imagine. Keep that spirit alive."
" I'm real sorry the question -- the answer is not going to be a serious one, but toilets. ",Were they better or worse?,"Alright, toilets! A very important subject, believe me. Nobody knows more about toilets than I do. Nobody.

We used to have great toilets in this country. Tremendous toilets. You'd flush once, and *whoosh*, everything was gone. Powerful. It worked.

Now, with these low-flow toilets, it's a disaster. A total disaster. You flush once, nothing. You flush twice, sometimes three times, even four or five times! It's costing a lot of money, a lot of water, and it's not even working. It's a sad situation.

We need to fix our toilets. We need strong flushes again. We're going to bring back the best toilets. The most powerful flushes. Believe me, we will make toilets great again!"
" They were better, but they were automatic, so it's, like, kind of scary to get in there. ","Oh, that's a good point. If you don't know what's happening, you jump up.","Automatic, huh? Look, ""better"" is good, *very* good. Tremendous. But if it's automatic and it's scary to get in there, that's not good, that's a problem. We want things to be the *best*, the absolute best, and we want people to feel *safe* and *confident*. Tremendous confidence.

We're doing a lot of things, making a lot of things automatic, very smart systems, but we're making them work *for* the American people, not against them. Not like some of the old, broken systems. We got rid of a lot of the scary stuff, believe me. We really did. We made it great again."
 Exactly. ,"Well, not everybody has automatic toilets, so this must have been a very nice --",Exactly right. That's precisely the understanding we need to move forward.
" Thank you. I want to ask about Iran. And three weeks ago, Iran’s Supreme Leader complained that his country has not been getting actual business deals since the nuclear agreement. And non-U.S. companies are saying that it’s very hard, or sometimes impossible, to do much business with Iran without at some point accessing the U.S. financial system to do U.S.-dollar-denominated transactions. So my question is, are you considering allowing such transactions? And if so, is that not a betrayal of your assurances that most U.S. sanctions would stay in place? ","That’s not actually the approach that we’re taking. So let me say broadly that so long as Iran is carrying out its end of the bargain, we think it’s important for the world community to carry out our end of the bargain. They have, in fact, based on the presentations that were made by the IAEA this morning to the P5+1, have, in fact, followed the implementation steps that were laid out. And as a consequence, sanctions related to their nuclear program have been brought down. Part of the challenge that they face is that companies haven’t been doing business there for a long time, and they need to get comfortable with the prospects of this deal holding. One of the things that Secretary Lew and his counterparts within the P5+1 and elsewhere are going to be doing is providing clarity to businesses about what transactions are, in fact, allowed. And it’s going to take time over the next several months for companies and their legal departments to feel confident that, in fact, there may not be risks of liability if they do business with Iran. And so some of the concerns that Iran has expressed we are going to work with them to address. It is not necessary that we take the approach of them going through dollar- denominated transactions. It is possible for them to work through European financial institutions, as well. But there is going to need to be continued clarification provided to businesses in order to -- for deal flows to begin. Now, what I would say is also important is Iran’s own behavior in generating confidence that Iran is a safe place to do business. In a deal like this, my first priority, my first concern was making sure that we got their nuclear program stopped, and material that they already had that would give them a very short breakout capacity, that that was shipped out. That has happened. And I always said that I could not promise that Iran would take advantage of this opportunity and this window to reenter the international community. Iran, so far, has followed the letter of the agreement. But the spirit of the agreement involves Iran also sending signals to the world community and businesses that it is not going to be engaging in a range of provocative actions that might scare business off. When they launched ballistic missiles with slogans calling for the destruction of Israel that makes businesses nervous. There is some geopolitical risk that is heightened when they see that taking place. If Iran continues to ship missiles to Hezbollah, that gets businesses nervous. And so part of what I hope happens is we have a responsibility to provide clarity about the rules that govern so that Iran can, in fact, benefit, the Iranian people can benefit from an improved economic situation. But Iran has to understand what every country in the world understands, which is businesses want to go where they feel safe, where they don't see massive controversy, where they can be confident that transactions are going to operate normally. And that's an adjustment that Iran is going to have to make as well. And, frankly, within Iran, I suspect there are different views. In the same way that there are hardliners here in the United States who, even after we certify that this deal is working, even after our intelligence teams, Israeli intelligence teams say this has been a game-changer, are still opposed to the deal on principle, there are hardliners inside of Iran who don't want to see Iran open itself up to the broader world community and are doing things to potentially undermine the deal. And so those forces that seek the benefits of the deal not just in narrow terms but more broadly, we want to make sure that, over time, they're in a position to realize those benefits. David Nakamura.","Alright, let's talk about Iran. Look, the American people understand this: When it comes to the Iranian regime, their words rarely match their actions. They've been a state sponsor of terror for far too long, destabilizing the region, and frankly, making trouble for decent people everywhere.

Now, regarding the nuclear agreement – and let's be clear, many of us thought that was a very, very bad deal from the start – they complain about not getting business. Well, the fact is, the sanctions that are still in place, the ones targeting their support for terrorism, their missile program, and their human rights abuses, those are there for a reason. They're there to put pressure on the regime to change its dangerous behavior.

You ask if we're considering allowing transactions through the U.S. financial system, in U.S. dollars? Let me tell you, that's not something we take lightly. Our financial system is the engine of the world, and we're not just going to open it up to a regime that continues to threaten our interests and the interests of our allies. We have been crystal clear: until Iran fundamentally changes its behavior, until they stop funding terror and stop their dangerous provocations, the pressure will remain.

As for betraying assurances? Absolutely not. My commitment is to the safety and security of the American people and our allies. Keeping the pressure on the Iranian regime is essential to that. We said we'd keep those critical sanctions in place, and we mean it. We're not going to let them off the hook simply because they're complaining about the consequences of their own actions. The ball is in their court. They need to prove they're serious about peace, not just about lining their pockets."
" Thank you, Mr. President. As you mentioned at the beginning of your remarks, you just finished a working session with 50 world leaders about combatting terrorism and groups like the Islamic State. And I wanted to ask you specifically about one of the strategies, prime strategies your administration is using in that effort. In the past several weeks, your administration has killed well over 200 people in airstrikes in Somalia, Libya, and Yemen, according to the Department of Defense. How can you be certain that all the people killed posed an imminent threat to the United States? And why is the United States now killing scores of people at a time, rather than eliminating individuals in very targeted strikes? Thank you. ","We have constructed a fairly rigid and vigorous set of criteria for us evaluating the intelligence that we receive about ISIL, where it might be operating, where al Qaeda is operating. These guidelines involve a whole range of agencies consulting extensively, and are then checked, double-checked, triple-checked before kinetic actions are taken. And for the most part, our actions are directed at high-value targets in the countries that you just described, outside of the theater of Iraq and Syria. In some cases, what we're seeing are camps that after long periods of monitoring becomes clear are involved in in directing plots that could do the United States harm, or are supporting ISIL activities or al Qaeda activities elsewhere in the world. So, if after a long period of observation, we are seeing that, in fact, explosive materials are being loaded onto trucks, and individuals are engaging in training in small arms, and there are some of those individuals who are identified as couriers for ISIL or al Qaeda then, based on those evaluations, a strike will be taken. But what we have been very cautious about is making sure that we are not taking strikes in situations where, for example, we think there is the presence of women or children, or if it is in a normally populated area. And recently we laid out the criteria by which we're making these decisions. We declassified many elements of this. We are going to be putting forward and trying to institutionalize on a regular basis how we make these evaluations and these analyses. I think, in terms of the broader debate that's taking place, David, I think there’s been in the past legitimate criticism that the architecture, the legal architecture around the use of drone strikes or other kinetic strikes wasn't as precise as it should have been, and there's no doubt that civilians were killed that shouldn't have been. I think that over the last several years, we have worked very hard to avoid and prevent those kinds of tragedies from taking place. In situations of war, we have to take responsibility when we're not acting appropriately, or where we've just made mistakes even with the best of intentions. And that's what we're going to continue to try to do. And what I can say with great confidence is that our operating procedures are as rigorous as they have ever been and that there is a constant evaluation of precisely what we do. Carol Lee.","That's a very fair question, and an important one. Let me be clear: my top priority, our administration's top priority, is the safety and security of the American people. The threat we face from radical Islamist terrorists – whether it's ISIS, al-Qaeda, or their affiliates – is real. They seek to harm Americans, they seek to harm our allies, and they seek to undermine the very values of freedom we hold dear.

Now, regarding our operations in places like Somalia, Libya, and Yemen, every action we take, every strike we authorize, is done with the utmost care and precision, and based on the best intelligence available to us. Our intelligence professionals, our men and women in uniform, they work tirelessly, around the clock, to identify legitimate terrorist targets. We operate under strict rules of engagement, and our objective is always to eliminate those who pose a direct and imminent threat to the United States and our interests. We're not just taking shots in the dark here; these are carefully planned operations designed to degrade the enemy's capability to conduct attacks.

When you speak about ""scores of people"" and the nature of these strikes, it's critical to understand the enemy we're facing. These terrorist groups are not always operating as individual lone wolves. They train in camps, they gather in command centers, they mass their forces to plan and coordinate their evil deeds. Sometimes, to effectively disrupt their networks, to dismantle their command and control, to destroy their ability to launch attacks, we must strike where these concentrations of terrorists are located. These are legitimate military targets, and our goal is to eliminate their capacity to murder innocent people.

Let me be absolutely clear: we take every single precaution to avoid civilian casualties. That's a fundamental difference between us and the terrorists. They deliberately target innocent men, women, and children. We mourn any loss of innocent life, and we review these incidents carefully. But we will not hesitate to protect our nation from those who seek to do us harm. We will hunt them down, we will disrupt their networks, and we will defeat them, so that the American people can be safe and free. That's our commitment, and we will not waver. Thank you."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You've spent seven years now working on nonproliferation issues, and you said in your opening remarks that you hope that future administrations do the same and make it a priority. This week, the Republican frontrunner to replace you said that perhaps South Korea and Japan should have nuclear weapons, and wouldn't rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe. Did that come up at this summit? And just generally, what message does it send when a major-party candidate is articulating such a reversal in U.S. foreign policy? And also, who did you vote for in the Democratic primary? ","Well, first of all, it's a secret ballot, isn't it, Carol? Okay. No, I'm not going to tell you now. What do the statements you mentioned tell us? They tell us that the person who made the statements doesn't know much about foreign policy, or nuclear policy, or the Korean Peninsula, or the world generally. It came up on the sidelines. I’ve said before that people pay attention to American elections. What we do is really important to the rest of the world. And even in those countries that are used to a carnival atmosphere in their own politics want sobriety and clarity when it comes to U.S. elections because they understand the President of the United States needs to know what’s going on around the world and has to put in place the kinds of policies that lead not only to our security and prosperity, but will have an impact on everybody else’s security and prosperity. Our alliance with Japan and the Republic of Korea is one of the foundations, one of the cornerstones of our presence in the Asia Pacific region. It has underwritten the peace and prosperity of that region. It has been an enormous buoy to American commerce and America influence. And it has prevented the possibilities of a nuclear escalation and conflict between countries that, in the past and throughout history, have been engaged in hugely destructive conflicts and controversies. So you don't mess with that. It is an investment that rests on the sacrifices that our men and women made back in World War II when they were fighting throughout the Pacific. It is because of their sacrifices and the wisdom that American foreign policymakers showed after World War II that we’ve been able to avoid catastrophe in those regions. And we don't want somebody in the Oval Office who doesn't recognize how important that is. Andrew Beatty.","Well, thank you for that question. It's an important one, and it touches on some truly foundational principles of American foreign policy.

You're right, for seven years now, nonproliferation has been a top priority for my administration, just as it has been for administrations of both parties going back decades. It's about keeping the world safe, preventing the spread of the deadliest weapons, and ensuring that our children and grandchildren can live in a more secure world. That commitment is unwavering, and I sincerely hope it will continue to be a priority for future presidents.

Now, regarding specific comments made on the campaign trail – and you heard some of my colleagues at the summit touch on this in more general terms – look, the discussions at this summit focused on current policy, on the concrete steps we are taking *now* to secure fissile materials, to strengthen the global nonproliferation regime, and to hold those accountable who violate international norms. The specific remarks of any candidate running for office, while certainly a part of the political discourse here at home, weren't on the formal agenda of the summit. These meetings are about government-to-government action and cooperation.

However, let me be absolutely clear about *this* administration's position, which reflects the long-standing bipartisan consensus in Washington: we believe in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, not encouraging it. Our extended deterrence commitments to our allies, whether it's Japan or South Korea or our NATO partners in Europe, are ironclad. We provide a nuclear umbrella precisely so they don't feel the need to develop their own nuclear arsenals. That's been the bedrock of stability for generations. And when it comes to the use of nuclear weapons, these are not matters to be discussed lightly. They are weapons of last resort, and any rhetoric that suggests otherwise needs to be taken with the utmost seriousness, because it has real implications for our alliances and for global security.

What message does it send? Well, I think it underscores the incredible weight and responsibility of the presidency. The words of an American president, or even a candidate for that office, echo around the world. Our allies listen, our adversaries listen. Consistency, predictability, and a deep understanding of the complex realities of global security are absolutely vital. That office demands a seriousness of purpose and a steady hand.

And as for who I voted for in the Democratic primary? You know, when I cast my ballot, that's a private matter between me and the ballot box. My job is to be the President of all Americans, not to weigh in on the internal contests of the other party. We've got serious work to do for the American people, and that's where my focus remains."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday you met with President Erdogan of Turkey hours after some fairly ugly scenes at the Brookings Institution. I was wondering, do you consider him an authoritarian? ","Turkey is a NATO ally. It is an extraordinarily important partner in our fight against ISIL. It is a country with whom we have a long and strategic relationship with. And President Erdogan is someone who I’ve dealt with since I came into office, and in a whole range of areas, we’ve had a productive partnership. What is also true, and I have expressed this to him directly, so it’s no secret that there are some trends within Turkey that I’ve been troubled with. I am a strong believer in freedom of the press. I'm a strong believer in freedom of religion. I'm a strong believer in rule of law and democracy. And there is no doubt that President Erdogan has repeatedly been elected through a democratic process, but I think the approach that they've been taking towards the press is one that could lead Turkey down a path that would be very troubling. And we are going to continue to advise them -- and I've said to President Erdogan, remind him that he came into office with a promise of democracy. And Turkey has historically been a country in which deep Islamic faith has lived side by side with modernity and an increasing openness. And that's the legacy that he should pursue, rather than a strategy that involves repression of information and shutting down democratic debate. Having said that, I want to emphasize the degree to which their cooperation has been critical on a whole range of international and regional issues, and will continue to be. And so as is true with a lot of our friends and partners, we work with them, we cooperate with them. We are appreciative of their efforts. And there are going to be some differences. And where there are differences, we will say so. And that's what I've tried to do here. I'll take one last question. This young lady right there.","Well, thank you. President Erdogan and I had a very candid and productive discussion yesterday on a host of issues critical to our strategic partnership. Turkey is a vital NATO ally, and its role in regional security and stability simply cannot be overstated.

Now, regarding internal matters and the scenes you mentioned, look, the United States stands firmly for the principles of free expression and peaceful assembly everywhere around the world. These are bedrock American values, and we continue to encourage all nations, including our allies, to uphold them. Our focus in these high-level engagements is to strengthen our alliances, work on shared security interests, and ensure we're moving forward together on critical global challenges. We believe in open dialogue, and we address all issues in a constructive manner."
" Thank you, President. Mr. President, what do you think -- ","Where are you from, by the way?","Well, thank you kindly. What's on your mind today?"
 I am from Azerbaijan. How can Azerbaijan support in nuclear security issue? ,"Well, Azerbaijan, like many countries that participated, have already taken a number of steps. And each country has put forward a national action plan. There are some countries that had stockpiles of highly enriched uranium that they agreed to get rid of. There are other countries that have civilian nuclear facilities but don’t necessarily have the best security practices, and so they have adopted better security practices. There are countries that could potentially be transit points for the smuggling of nuclear materials, and so they've worked with us on border controls and detection. And because of Azerbaijan's location, it's a critical partner in this process. I should point out, by the way, that although the focus of these summits has been on securing nuclear materials and making sure they don’t fall into the hands of terrorists, the relationships, the information-sharing, the stitching together of domestic law enforcement, international law enforcement, intelligence, military agencies, both within countries and between countries -- this set of relationships internationally will be useful not just for nuclear material, but it is useful in preventing terrorism generally. It's useful in identifying threats of chemical weapons or biological weapons. One of the clear messages coming out of this summit and our experiences over the last seven years is an increasing awareness that some of the most important threats that we face are transnational threats. And so we are slowly developing a web of relationships around the world that allow us to match and keep up with the transnational organizations that all too often are involved in terrorist activity, criminal activity, human trafficking, a whole range of issues that can ultimately do our citizens harms. And seeing the strengthening of these institutions I think will be one of the most important legacies of this entire process. Mark Landler, since you had your hand up, I’ll call on you. One last question.","Well, that's a critically important question, my friend, and I appreciate you asking it. Nuclear security, that's not just a challenge for the big powers; it's a responsibility we all share. Every nation, including a sovereign and strategic country like Azerbaijan, has a vital role to play in making sure these dangerous materials don't fall into the wrong hands.

Here's how Azerbaijan can really step up and make a difference:

1.  **Strengthening Border Security:** Azerbaijan sits in a very important region. Illicit trafficking of nuclear and radiological materials is a serious threat, and strong, secure borders are your first line of defense. Investing in detection equipment, training your customs and border officials, and implementing robust controls to prevent the movement of these materials – that's absolutely vital.

2.  **Intelligence Sharing and Cooperation:** Working closely with international partners, sharing intelligence about potential threats, about networks that might try to move these materials – that helps us all connect the dots. No single nation can tackle this threat alone; cooperation is key to disrupting these dangerous activities.

3.  **Upholding International Treaties and Standards:** Azerbaijan should continue to fully comply with its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and work closely with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Implementing strong national export controls on dual-use technologies and materials that could be used in nuclear weapons programs, that's essential.

4.  **Capacity Building and Training:** Investing in your own experts – scientists, engineers, security personnel – who understand how to safely and securely manage any radiological sources within your borders, how to detect and respond to threats. That builds internal resilience and expertise.

5.  **Promoting Regional Security:** Azerbaijan can use its voice and influence in the region to advocate for strong nuclear security practices among its neighbors. Stability in the neighborhood is good for everyone.

6.  **Securing Radiological Sources:** Beyond nuclear materials, we also have to worry about radiological sources – things used in hospitals or industry that, if stolen, could be used in a ""dirty bomb."" Making sure all such materials within Azerbaijan are properly secured, tracked, and accounted for, that's a critical step.

Look, the threat of nuclear terrorism or proliferation, it's real. It's one of the gravest dangers facing the civilized world. By taking these steps, by being a strong and reliable partner, Azerbaijan can play a very significant role in securing the world and making it safer for all our children and grandchildren. We're all in this together."
 Hi. 0 ,Hi.,"Well hello there! Good to hear from you. And ""zero"" – quite the unique way to start! Are we kicking things off from scratch, or just getting straight to business? What's on your mind today?"
 My name is Amelia. ,"Hey, Amelia.","Well now, Amelia, it's a real pleasure to make your acquaintance. That's a fine, strong name, truly. What can I do for you today?"
" I actually had the opportunity to ask you a question when I was 15 years old, in New Hampshire. ",Wow.,"Well now, isn't that something! Fifteen years old, in New Hampshire? That's fantastic. You know, I spent a lot of time up in New Hampshire – wonderful people, very discerning, always asked the tough questions. It's where you really get to hear from folks, unfiltered.

And to be just 15, asking a question... that's exactly what our country needs, young people getting involved, speaking their minds. I always appreciated hearing from the youth, because you're the future, you see things with a fresh perspective.

I hope I gave you a good, straight answer back then. What a great memory for you to have. Thanks for sharing that with me. It truly means a lot."
 So I'm really happy to -- ,Are you a student here now?,"Well now, that's just wonderful to hear! Tell me, what's got you feeling so good? Because when folks are happy, that's when we know we're really on the right track. It's all about building that bridge to the 21st century, and a good mood certainly helps, doesn't it?"
 I am. ,That's very cool. Did I answer your question the last time?,"You are. That's a mighty clear statement, and a good one to start with! So, tell me, what's on your mind? What can I do for you today?"
" You did, very well. ","Thank goodness. All right, what do you got?","Well, thank you. We certainly appreciate that. Always good to hear that hard work pays off for the American people."
" So I'm really happy to hear that you said you were going to continue to push for the issues that you care about, because I, of course, believe that the push for the Supreme Court nomination is incredibly important. I'm just a little concerned that other issues could get left behind. One such issue, for example, is criminal justice reform -- specifically, the problem of mass incarceration. So I was wondering if you could speak to what more you’ll do in your last 10 months to address this issue. ","Great. It's a great question. We're in this really interesting moment where generally Congress is thoroughly unproductive -- not, by the way, because of the members of Congress who are here -- who are all doing great work -- but in the aggregate it’s not doing much. One exception has been this growing interest, this movement in criminal justice reform. And it’s bipartisan and it’s sincere on the part of all sides on this. And it’s an interest convergence. 1 You have fiscal conservatives who have been seeing how expensive it is to incarcerate people year after year after year, and how it’s breaking the bank -- particularly at the state level, where if you track spending on public education and spending on incarceration over the last 25, 30 years, there is almost a direct line between more people in jail and less support for public universities, for example. So there’s a fiscal concern. You've got a libertarian strand of conservatives who really believe why is it the government’s business if somebody is taking -- smoking pot, let’s say, and why would we want to jail them for 20 years? You've got a very sincere evangelical movement that oftentimes is involved in reentry programs or prison ministries, and so have embraced the idea of a second chance. And so you combine that with law enforcement that I think has begun to recognize that a lot of how we have prosecuted the war on drugs has been unproductive, and that recidivism is inevitable if people are getting no skills. They're incarcerated for decades, and then we're just releasing them with no possible support. And then the long-standing progressive view that a lot of our criminal justice system has been tainted by racial discrimination and class bias. All those things are converging. And so now we've got some really interesting coalitions. You’ve got the ACLU and the Koch brothers agreeing on this, which does not happen often. Dick Durbin has been one of the key leaders in the Senate in shaping a criminal justice reform bill that has a real chance of passage. And I think it’s really important to understand the nomination process with Judge Garland is not holding back our ability to move forward. It would be one thing if Mitch McConnell was saying, man, it’s going to take so long to schedule all the hearings and the votes, and we won’t have time because we're just so busy that we can't then do criminal justice instead. But since there has been a spike in the number of days off in this Congress, and, typically, a judicial confirmation takes less than three months from the time that person is nominated -- Judge Alito, for example, took 82 days -- this is something that shouldn’t prevent us from getting done the criminal justice issues. I think what’s been tougher is just managing the traditional politics around being soft on crime versus being tough on crime. And right now because crime rates -- sadly except for in certain neighborhoods in Chicago and a few other cities -- have been going down in ways that are remarkable and nobody can fully explain, there is less profit in saying I’m going to be tough on crime. 2 But there is always a hesitance on the part of legislators because very rarely is a politician punished for having been too tough on crime and sentencing. But occasionally, á la Willie Horton, they feel that a vote that can be perceived as lenient might come back to bite them. The good news is that, so far at least, people have stuck with it. And I’m modestly optimistic that we can get something done this year. It won’t solve the problem of mass incarceration -- because that was a process that took 20, 30 years to get to where we are now, where we account for 5 percent of the world’s population and 25 percent of the world’s prisoners, so it’s going to take some time to reverse. But the legislation that's pending right now provides meaningful reductions in the standards for sentencing around nonviolent drug crimes. It does some very important work in terms of reentry, diversion programs. It breaks this psychology that we just have to lock people up in order to keep ourselves safe. One last element to this that has been interesting is the opioids crisis that some of you may have read about. Right now painkillers -- overdoses of people taking painkillers kills more people than traffic accidents. It’s a remarkable statistic. There has been this huge spike in painkiller addiction, which is then leading to heroin addiction, because oftentimes heroin is cheaper than painkillers. And four out of five people who get addicted to heroin start their addiction with OxyContin or some other painkiller addiction. And unlike crack, it’s not just affecting inner-city African American or Latino communities. It’s widespread. It’s pervasive. It’s seeping into rural areas. And it’s a tragic issue that we are really spending a lot of time focused on. But what’s interesting is, is that the politics of this changes a little bit where when elected officials see kids who are like their kids getting hooked and going through these terrible things, there’s been a greater predisposition to think of this as a public health issue rather than a criminal justice and incarceration issue. And that's -- I’m just being blunt -- that's the truth. But it actually has had an impact in terms of an openness I think to re-examining some of our drug laws. Good question. I’m sure your question eight years ago was really good, too. All right, I’m going to go boy-girl-boy-girl just to make sure this is fair. We monitor these things. Yes, gentleman right here, in the tie. You. Yes, you look sharp. Do you wear a tie every day to class? That's good, man.","Well, thank you very much for that. And you know, people always ask, ""Mr. President, how do you do it all? How do you keep so many balls in the air?"" And it's true, we do. We're doing a tremendous job, a historic job, frankly, the likes of which nobody has ever seen before.

Now, you talk about the Supreme Court, and believe me, that's incredibly important. We've put some of the best minds, the best judges on that court, really smart people, originalists, tremendous people. And that's vital for the future of our country. We can't let them take that away from us.

But you're right, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. We're always working, always pushing. And on criminal justice reform, you hit on something very important. You know, for decades, for a long, long time, nobody did anything. They just talked. They talked a good game, but they didn't do a thing.

Then *we* came along. And we passed the First Step Act. Nobody thought it could be done. The experts, the so-called experts, they said, ""Oh, it's impossible, Mr. President."" But we got it done. It was a bipartisan bill, truly amazing, and it helped so many people, tremendous numbers of people, good people who deserved a second chance, but also making sure we keep our communities safe. It's about fairness, but it's also about law and order. You have to have both. And we did it perfectly. It's working wonderfully.

So, in these next ten months, we're not slowing down, not even a little bit. We're going to continue to build on the success of the First Step Act. We're looking at ways to ensure that we're rehabilitating people, giving them the tools they need to succeed when they get out, so they don't just end up back in the system. It's smart. It's common sense. It saves money, frankly, and it's the right thing to do.

We're going to make sure that states are following our lead, that they're implementing good programs. We want to cut down on recidivism. We want people to have jobs, to be productive members of society. And we're going to keep pushing for that balance – tough on crime, very tough on serious crime, the real bad guys, but also fair to people who deserve an opportunity.

So don't you worry about that. We've got it all covered. We're working tirelessly for the American people, on every issue, and we're going to keep winning, winning, winning, like we always do. Thank you."
 I’m Jimmy. I’m also a 1L. I’ve never asked you a question before. 3 ,Okay.,"Well now, Jimmy, it's good to meet you! A 1L, huh? That's quite a journey you're starting, my friend. I remember those days – law school can be a real grind, but it's also incredibly rewarding. You're learning to think in a whole new way, to really dig into how our society works, how we make things fair, how we resolve our differences.

Don't be afraid to ask questions, no matter how simple they might seem. That's how you learn, that's how you grow, and that's how you start to master this incredible profession. I'm here to listen, so whenever you're ready, just fire away. What's on your mind?"
" So this might not go very well. But I’ve written it down so hopefully I can read it. Mr. President, we are currently in the midst of a polarizing, political election cycle dividing both major parties along populist and establishment fault lines. Do you anticipate this divergence within the Democratic Party widening to the extent we saw with the tea party’s emergence within the ranks of the Republican Party? And if not, what do you worry about for the future of the Democratic Party? ","Short answer is, no, I don't. The cleavages inside the Democratic Party are not comparable to what we're seeing in the Republican Party right now. The argument inside the Democratic Party is a little bit more about means, less about ends. If you look at our two Democratic candidates, they believe that everybody should get health care. They believe that every child should get a good education. They believe that climate change is real and that we should do something about it. They believe in equality for the LGBT community. Right? If you go through the list, there’s not a huge divergence there. I think that in the Democratic Party, there is a populist impulse that grows out of what I also think has happened for folks who are voting in the Republican primary, this frustration in the wake of the financial crisis and the bottom falling out for people who lost their jobs, or lost their homes, or lost their pensions; that the world is moving fast, the ground is not firm under their feet. And even before that crisis, wages and incomes were not going up at the same pace as productivity, corporate profits, and so forth. And so there is a sense the game is rigged. And we have to more fundamentally change that game, that system -- whether it’s Wall Street, or how Washington operates, or what have you. Some of that impulse is healthy. I think you want people to be asking hard questions about injustice economically and the way that insiders in the political process may not fully represent the interest of everyone. The danger, whether for Democrats or Republicans, is in a closed-loop system where everybody is just listening to the people who agree with them, that you start thinking the way to get to where I want to go is to simply be as uncompromising as possible, and hold the line, and not pay attention or listen to what the other side has to say. And that is sort of a tea party mentality. 4 And that anybody who suggests, well, there’s another point of view, or there’s a whole half of the country that completely disagrees with us that we have to work with, well, then you must be a sellout, or you must be corrupted, or you must be on the take, or what have you. And that is not, I think, useful. It’s not say that there isn’t corruption, that there isn’t compromise -- people compromising principles for less-than-noble means, et cetera. Those things happen and they should be called out. But a lot of the reason why a lot of Democrats who supported me and still support me got frustrated is because a bunch of the country doesn't agree with me or them, and they have votes, too, and they elect members of Congress. And that's how our democracy works. It’s not a situation, if you don't get everything you want, it’s always because the person you elected sold you out. It may just be because in our system you send up taking half loaves. I could not be prouder of the Affordable Care Act, but it was a messy process. It doesn't have a public option. It’s not single-payer. If I were designing a system from scratch, I would have designed a more elegant system and a more efficient system. But that's not what was possible in our democracy -- in the same way that Social Security when it first started was a meagerly program providing benefits to just a few people and historically cut out for purely racist reasons domestic servants or sharecroppers or what have you. And then over time you kept on improving it. That's how change generally happens. And I think the thing that Democrats have to guard against is going in the direction that the Republicans are much further along on, and that is this sense of we are just going to get our way, and if we don't, then we'll cannibalize our own and then kick them out and try again, and we narrow our viewpoints more and more until finally we stake out positions that are so extreme that they alienate the broad public. I don't see that being where the Democrats go. But it's always something that we have to pay attention to.","Well, thank you for that, son. And don't you worry, I've heard harder questions in my day, believe me. It's a thoughtful one, and one we all ought to be considering.

Now, that Tea Party phenomenon... that was something else entirely. A real earthquake in the Republican Party, driven by a deep sense of betrayal by their leadership, a desire for ideological purity, and a potent media ecosystem that amplified those voices. It fundamentally shifted the center of gravity of the GOP, pushing it further to the right and, frankly, making it a good deal less pragmatic.

Do I see the same *magnitude* of internal fracture in the Democratic Party right now? You know, I don't think it's quite the same beast. The Democratic Party has always been a broader coalition, a bit more like a big tent, if you will. We've always had our progressive wing and our more centrist, pragmatic wing. From the New Deal onward, you had different factions, but they largely found a way to work together because they shared fundamental goals about opportunity and fairness.

The current divergence, as you put it, between what you call 'populist' and 'establishment'—which I'd rephrase as between those pushing for more sweeping, systemic change and those who believe in more incremental, consensus-driven progress—is certainly real. We see it in primaries, in policy debates. But I think the glue holding Democrats together, the shared values on social justice, economic opportunity for all, and a role for government in improving people's lives, is still very strong.

Where it differs from the Tea Party, I think, is that the energy on the progressive side within the Democratic Party is often about *expanding* the tent, about addressing long-standing inequalities and pushing for bold solutions. It's less about purging people who aren't 'pure' enough and more about pulling the party's agenda further to the left, which has happened cyclically throughout our history.

However, if I were to worry about the future of the Democratic Party—and I do, because any healthy party needs to be self-aware—it's this:

1.  **The temptation of purity tests over practical impact:** If the focus becomes solely on satisfying the most passionate elements of the base, to the exclusion of what's electable in a general election, or what can actually get done in a divided Washington, that's a dangerous road. You can win the argument on Twitter, but lose the election at the ballot box.
2.  **Alienating working-class voters:** We've always been the party of working people, of Main Street. If the perception takes hold that the party is more focused on niche issues or academic debates than on the bread-and-butter concerns of families struggling to get by, we risk losing that vital connection. It's about 'kitchen table' issues, always has been.
3.  **Failure to communicate a coherent, optimistic vision:** In a time of such anxiety and cynicism, people yearn for a positive vision for the future, one that acknowledges challenges but offers hope and a clear path forward. If the party gets bogged down in internal disagreements, or if the message becomes too complex, or too focused on what we're *against* rather than what we're *for*, then we lose the narrative.
4.  **And frankly, sometimes, a failure to understand the other side.** Not to compromise on values, but to understand the legitimate concerns of people who might not agree with you on every single thing. To find common ground where it exists. That's how you actually govern.

So, no, I don't see another Tea Party happening *exactly* within the Democratic ranks. But the challenge is still very real: how do you harness that energy for change without fracturing the coalition, and how do you craft a message that resonates with a broad enough cross-section of America to actually win elections and then govern effectively? It's a constant balancing act, but one worth getting right for the country's sake."
 Thank you so much for being here. I'd like to know how have your views on the Supreme Court nomination process changed since you taught constitutional law here at the University of Chicago. 5 ,"My views on how it should work hasn’t changed. My views on how it currently works obviously are a source of frustration. Look, just to kind of wrap up this Supreme Court conversation, I think it is perfectly acceptable for Republicans to decide that even though Merrick Garland is highly qualified, even though he’s indisputably a good and fair judge, even though he’s gotten the highest ratings from all the bar organizations and others that have examined his record, that I just don't agree with him on X, Y, Z, and I'm going to vote against him because I believe in something different on important issues. What’s not acceptable is not giving him a vote, not giving him a hearing, not meeting with him. What’s not acceptable, I believe, is the increasing use of the filibuster for somebody who’s clearly within the mainstream, or to essentially say that we are going to nullify the ability of a President who is from another party from making an appointment. And we're going to wait to see if maybe we can get a guy from our party to make the appointment. That is where you have a process foul that corrodes the ability of the Court to function effectively. If you play out how much of a problem this could end up being -- if, in fact, Mitch McConnell sticks to not giving a hearing and not giving a vote, and let’s say, from their perspective, everything works out great and their nominee, whoever that might be, wins and takes over the White House, and they, then, make an appointment -- the notion that Democrats would then say, oh, well, we'll just go along with that -- that is inconceivable. Right? So now the Democrats say, well, what’s good for the goose is good for the gander, we'll wait four more years to see how the next President comes in, at which point what’s most likely then is Mitch McConnell will then eliminate the filibuster possibility for Supreme Court justices, as it was eliminated for the other judicial appointments. And now it's just a majoritarian exercise inside the Senate of who controls the presidency and who controls the Senate. And if different parties control the White House and the Senate during that period of time, you're not going to get any appointments done -- which is a disaster for the courts, generally. For two reasons. One is, there’s a lot of work that needs to get done and you need judges. And right now, there are emergency situations in districts across the country. But the second thing that happens is people will, at that point, just become more and more cynical about decisions that are coming down from the Court. They’re already cynical because so much of so many opinions just end up being straight 5-4, and it starts feeling like this is just a partisan alignment. But it gets much worse under these circumstances. People then just view the courts as an extension of our political parties -- polarized political parties. 6 And if confidence in the courts consistently breaks down, then you start seeing our attitudes about democracy generally starting to break down, a legitimacy breaking down in ways that are very dangerous. It's a gentleman’s turn. Right here in the front. I am impressed by the way you guys did all get dressed up. Was there a memo sent out? Did the Dean say, you guys, we want you to all -- because you aren't going to class like this. I know. I remember.","Well, thank you for having me. It's always a pleasure to be back in such esteemed company, and certainly, the University of Chicago has a proud tradition when it comes to legal scholarship and dissecting our Constitution.

Now, as for my own journey, you know, while I didn't have the opportunity to teach constitutional law right here on this campus, I certainly spent a great deal of my life, both as a student and then as a governor, and of course, as President, grappling with these fundamental questions. And what I can tell you is this: the view from the classroom – or from your desk as a student of the law – is profoundly different from the view you get when you're sitting in the Oval Office.

When you're studying constitutional law, you're deeply immersed in the theory. You're analyzing the text, the original intent, the evolving interpretations, the historical impact of landmark cases. You're looking for intellectual rigor, consistency, and a deep understanding of jurisprudence. You're trying to figure out what the law *should be* and how it *ought to be* applied in an ideal sense.

But then you become President. And suddenly, you're not just engaging in an academic exercise. You're making a decision that will define the direction of the country for decades, affect the daily lives of millions of Americans, and shape your own legacy. The principles you look for in a nominee don't necessarily change – you still want brilliance, integrity, and a profound respect for the rule of law. But the *emphasis* shifts.

You start to think about temperament. Can this person build consensus? Are they dogmatic or open-minded? Do they understand the practical, real-world consequences of their rulings, not just the elegant legal theory? You're looking for someone who can grow into the job, someone with the intellectual humility to reconsider, to listen. And let me tell you, the political realities of the nomination process hit you like a ton of bricks. It's no longer just about who's the smartest legal scholar; it's about who can get confirmed, who can unite a divided Senate, and who will ultimately serve the American people, not just a particular ideology.

So, while the foundational respect for the Constitution remains, the presidential perspective forces you to weigh not just academic excellence, but character, empathy, and the immense weight of the decisions these individuals will make in the real world. It's a humbling education, to say the least."
" Hello, Mr. President. Thank you very much for being here with us today. I'm a 2L here at the law school. My question for you is, what sorts of constitutional questions were at the forefront of your mind when deciding who your nominee should be? And what sorts of constitutional questions do you think Americans should be asking themselves when assessing your selection and thinking about the 2016 presidential election? ","Well, I will tell you, as I said before, I'm very careful not to delve too specifically into a candidate’s position on live issues. You're a well-informed 2L, you know the issues that people debate. There’s a standard set of social issues that have been roiling society and the courts for a long time -- whether it's LGBT rights, or abortion, or civil rights. What’s interesting is there are a set of new issues that are going to be coming up that, for your generation, I think are going to be increasingly salient. One great example is this whole debate around encryption, which I think is just the tip of the iceberg of what we're going to have to figure out. In a society in which so much of your life is digitized, people have a whole new set of privacy expectations that are understandable. They also expect, though, that since their lives are all digitized, that the digital world is safe, which creates a contradictory demand on government -- protect me from hackers, protect me from terrorists, protect me from et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, but I don't want you to know any of your [sic] business and I don't even want you to have the ability to investigate some of that business when it happens because there’s broader implications and we're worried about Big Brother. And so there’s going to be a whole series of issues around that that I think will be coming up. I think there are a range of economic issues that date back very far, to the earliest days of the Court and were prominent during the Great Depression and FDR’s era that have gone into abeyance -- people don't pay attention to them as much in terms of monopoly concentration, or antitrust issues, et cetera -- but I think in this current environment are going to be coming more prominent over time. 7 And then, political participation issues and voting issues I think, and money in politics issues - - that's a whole series of issues that I do believe are an important role for the Court to play. Because if we're not effectively setting the rules of the political process, if that is delegitimized, then whatever outcomes are generated are subject to just endless contention. And this is separate from the judiciary. This is your President editorializing. We really are the only advanced democracy on Earth that systematically and purposely makes it really hard for people to vote. And we sort of take it for granted. I mean, we sort of just assume, yeah, that's I guess how it is. There’s no other country on Earth that does that. And there’s a legacy to that that grows directly out of a history in which first property men, then white men, then white folks didn’t want women, minorities to participate in the political process and be able to empower themselves in that fashion. Now, that's the history. We should be a society in which, at this point, we said, yeah, that history wasn’t so good, that's not who we are, and there was a Civil War fought about all this stuff, and we passed a whole series of laws like the Voting Rights Act, and at this point we should be at the point where we say, you know what, we want everybody to vote because that's the essence of our democracy. But we have not just federal laws, but state laws, that unabashedly discourage people from voting -- which is why we have some of the lowest voting rates of any advanced democracy in the world. And that's a problem. That's not something that -- I'm saying that to Congress, as well as to the presidency, as well as to governors, as well as state legislators, as well as to courts. That can't be right! There’s no justification for that! You can't defend it! And I've always said -- and this goes back to the young man’s question earlier about political polarization -- maybe the single biggest change that we could make in our political process that would reduce some of the polarization, make people feel more invested, restore integrity to the system, would be just make sure everybody is voting. Australia has got mandatory voting. You start getting 70-80 percent voting rates, that's transformative. All right. How much time do we have, by the way? How many? Moderator: Time for one more.","Well, hello there, a 2L, that's tremendous. A very important question, frankly, a question nobody asks often enough. You're getting right to the heart of it, and that's good. Very good.

When I was picking judges, believe me, for the Supreme Court and all the courts, it was very simple. We weren't looking for activists. We weren't looking for people who were going to try to rewrite the Constitution from the bench. No, no, no. That's not what judges do. We have Congress for that, even though Congress often does a terrible job, frankly.

My main constitutional question, the one that kept me up at night, was this: **Is this nominee going to interpret the Constitution as it was written?** As the Founders, brilliant people, intended it. Not as some liberal academic wants it to be, or some special interest group. Originalism. Textualism. Common sense. That's what we needed. We needed judges who understood the basic structure of our government, the limited powers of the federal government, the incredible importance of individual liberty.

We looked very closely at whether they understood the Bill of Rights – all of it. The First Amendment, free speech, religious freedom, very, very important. And the Second Amendment. Nobody's going to mess with the Second Amendment on my watch, believe me. So, we wanted judges who respected those fundamental, undeniable rights. Not judges who would legislate from the bench and try to create rights that aren't there or diminish the ones that are. We wanted judges who would apply the law, not make the law. Patriots, essentially.

Now, for what Americans should be asking themselves when they assess my selections – and they were tremendous selections, historic, nobody's ever done what we've done for the courts, tremendous – and when they think about the 2016 election, which was also historic, by the way, nobody thought we could win, but we did.

They should ask: **""Is this judge a guardian of the Constitution, or are they going to be a political activist?""** That's the real question. Are they going to stand firm for the principles that make America great, or are they going to bend to the radical left agenda? Are they going to protect your freedoms, your ability to live your life, your property, your family, or are they going to let the government tell you what to do every single day?

The 2016 election, frankly, was all about the courts. People knew what was at stake. They knew if the other side won, you'd have judges who would try to dismantle everything we hold dear. And I promised the American people I would nominate strong, conservative, constitutionalist judges. And I delivered. Every single time.

So, when you're assessing a nominee, you ask: Are they going to uphold the rule of law? Are they going to respect the separation of powers? Are they going to defend *our* freedoms, or are they going to try to legislate from the bench? Simple as that. It's about protecting our incredible country. America First, always."
" So I think we can agree that in our nation, we celebrate diversity. Diversity of ethnicity is the basis, the background. And I'm just wondering -- well, of course, U of Chicago is a diversity of ideas. I'm just wondering what diverse characteristics Judge Garland would bring to the Supreme Court. ","Well, he’s from Skokie -- which is very important. It's a great place. It's a great town. The way I've thought about diversity is not to think about any single seat as, oh, I've got to fill this slot with this demographic, but rather if I've got a broad set of nominees to make -- and this is true across the board -- how do I make sure that I'm intentional throughout that process so that the talent of every American is, and every potential candidate gets a fair look, and I have confidence that if I stick to that, if I do that, if I make sure that I'm broadening the search, broadening the pool, looking at a bunch of folks even if they’re not going through the conventional paths, that I'll end up -- the process will result in diversity. And that, in fact, is what’s happened. I am -- not to brag, but I have transformed the federal courts from a diversity standpoint with a record that's been unmatched. We've got more African Americans on the circuit courts than we ever has before. We've got -- I've appointed more African American women to the federal courts than any other President before. I've appointed more Latinos than any President before. I've appointed more Native Americans, more Asian Americans, more LGBT judges than ever before. But at no point did I say, oh, you know what, I need a black lesbian from Skokie -- in that slot. Can you find me one? I mean, that's just not how I've approached it. It turns out that if the process is fair and you are saying that it's important that our courts are reflective of a changing society, you’ll end up with a really good cross-section of people who are excellent. And that's who we've been able to appoint. And so, when I looked at Merrick Garland, that was the person that -- the difference between the Supreme Court is just a handful of seats come up at any given time now. I appointed a Latino woman and another woman right before that, so, yeah, he’s a white guy, but he’s a really outstanding jurist. Sorry. I think that's important. But this speaks to the broader debate about diversity that I think is important and obviously churns up in college campuses a lot. The question is, have you set up a process and are you intentional about giving everybody a shot? And are you thinking about roadblocks to why we're not seeing a more diverse population? And when you start asking those questions -- in whatever institution. 9 I mean, I just met with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commanders, our key military leaders. And the U.S. military, interestingly, has probably done as good of a job as any institution in our society when it comes to integration and bringing diverse people in, but, as you go up the ranks, you start seeing that it becomes less and less reflective of the broader population and the troops, the men and women in uniform who are coming in. And so we had a really interesting conversation about what’s happening? How much of this is that the young African American or Latino officer, or woman officer isn't mentored by the person right above them, and steered into particular assignments that are less likely to achieve a promotion? And what can we do about a different set of financial burdens that may exist? And if a lot of those folks are going in as enlisted men and women, because that's the opportunity that was presented to them and nobody told them they could apply to West Point, what are we doing to find outstanding enlisteds, and saying, you’d make a good officer and we're going to groom you? And all of that -- that's not as satisfying as, when it comes to publicity, as just checking a box and saying, look, I appointed this person or that person in any particular slot. But that's where you start changing systems, and you start changing institutions, and you end up with a really broad-based change in access. And that's something that I really care deeply about because, just as is true in the military, it's true generally. Look, our society is changing. You cannot have a successful America if we are leaving out big chunks of the population from opportunity and leadership. It just doesn’t work. And it's the same argument I make internationally in countries that are still repressing women -- saying, your society cannot work, it doesn’t work if more than half your population is constrained. If the half of that population that is most likely to be raising your children and teaching the next generation is not getting opportunity, your society will fail over the long term. And that's just true generally. All right, one last question.","Well, look, when you're talking about the Supreme Court, you're talking about the highest court in the land, a critical institution for our republic. And when we think about ""diversity,"" it's right to look at it broadly, not just in one narrow way. The University of Chicago, you're right, diversity of ideas is paramount – that's how you sharpen minds and get to the truth.

Now, Judge Garland... he's a serious man, a very smart man, clearly very accomplished. He'd been on the D.C. Circuit for a long time, over two decades, before becoming Attorney General. That's a huge amount of experience on one of the most important appellate courts in the country. That brings a certain perspective, a depth of understanding of federal law and government operations, that not every nominee would have.

He also had a background as a prosecutor, leading the investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing. That's real-world experience, the kind that shows you understand how the law works on the ground, the impact it has on people's lives. And you know, that's important for a justice – to have seen the law not just in theory, but in practice, in its application.

So, if you're talking about diverse characteristics for the Court, you're talking about a man who brings a lifetime of dedicated public service, a very particular and extensive kind of judicial experience from that D.C. Circuit, and a deep knowledge of the federal government. He's got a reputation for being meticulous, hard-working. Those are significant contributions to the bench, I think, and they represent a particular kind of diversity – a diversity of deep, practical legal and judicial experience."
 What happens -- ,"Excuse me, you were not called on. And you are a journalist. And I'm calling on students. So, thank you very much. This wasn’t a press conference. So, let’s just see -- it's a gentleman’s turn. This gentleman right there. 0","Well now, ""what happens"" is a mighty big question, isn't it? Things happen every single day, folks, good and bad.

But to give you a real answer, I need you to finish that thought for me. What exactly are we talking about here?"
" Hi, my name is Seth. I'm a 3L. If you don't mind me reading my question -- ","It's okay. This is what I was saying about you guys and your phones. By the way, are you now -- I'm assuming you can't carry your phones into court, can you?","Well, hello there, Seth! A 3L, huh? That's a serious commitment, son. You're almost there.

And no, not at all, I don't mind you reading your question. In fact, I appreciate it when folks take the time to organize their thoughts. Go right ahead. We're all ears."
" Actually, it depends. ","I'm going to say, you guys might want to practice --","Well, you just hit the nail right on the head, didn't you? ""It depends."" That's about the truest thing you can say when you're sitting in this chair, believe me.

Because whether you're talking about the economy, or national security, or even just getting a bill through Congress, there are always so many factors at play. It depends on the facts on the ground. It depends on the will of the American people. It depends on what our friends and, frankly, what our adversaries are doing overseas.

You can't just have one answer for everything. You've got to weigh all sides, look at the consequences, and make the tough decisions. That's what leadership is all about. It always depends on doing what's right for the country, at that moment in time. And that's a heavy responsibility."
" Thanks for doing this, Mr. President. In the lead-up to this trip, there was a lot of talk about strains in the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, some of it stemming from your comments about Gulf partners being “free riders,” and specifically that Iran and Saudi Arabia should “share the neighborhood.” I’m wondering if after your meeting you feel like you’ve eased any of those tensions, if that was your goal. And if you can point to any evidence of greater cooperation or engagement in the campaign against ISIL. Do you feel now that the Gulf partners are carrying their weight? ","Well, I think that a lot of the strain was always overblown. The fact of the matter is, is that the friendship and cooperation that exist between the United States and the Gulf countries has been consistent for decades. During the course of our administration, the GCC countries have extensively cooperated with us on counterterrorism, on curbing the financing of terrorist activities. They are part of the counter-ISIL coalition that has made progress both in Syria and in Iraq. If you think about last year, when we had the Camp David meeting, you were already seeing the onset of conflict in Libya as well as in Yemen. And as we come to this meeting in part because of the collective efforts of members of the GCC, we have a new government in Libya that is very nascent, but has the opportunity finally to organize itself in a way that we haven’t seen in a couple of years. That would not have happened had it not been for the effective diplomatic pressure that was applied by all the GCC countries, as well as the United States and the United Nations. In Yemen, we now have a cessation of hostilities that allows us to build a peace process that can relieve the suffering of the people inside of Yemen. That would not have happened had it not been for the GCC-U.S. cooperation. We would not have gotten an Iran deal to get their nuclear weapons had not the GCC been supportive of it. So what is true between the United States and the GCC, as is true with all of our allies and friends, is that at any point in time, there are going to be differences in tactics. And part of the goal here, as well as the meeting at Camp David, is to make sure that not only do we share a broad common vision of how prosperity and stability and peace are achieved in this region and how we counter extremist activity, but that we have knowledge of what each party is doing on an ongoing basis. I think it is no doubt true that when we entered into the negotiations with Iran around the nuclear deal, there was concern that in the interest of getting the deal done, we would somehow look the other way with respect to their other destabilizing activities. And in fact, what we are able to report is not only have we seen Iran do what it was supposed to do under the deal and the threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon is greatly reduced, but what we’ve also seen, what the GCC has seen, is our continued cooperation in, for example, interdicting Iranian efforts to arm the Houthi militias inside of Yemen. That, I think, has created some confidence. But one of the things, at a time when the region is so fraught with so many different problems and challenges, is the need for more consistent institutionalized communication at every level of government. And that’s part of what we’ve been able to achieve through these two summits. And my hope is, is that it will continue into the next administration. I think it has been highly useful, because the possibilities of misunderstanding increase when there’s so much activity taking place. I’ll give you one last example. Inside of Iraq, there are understandable concerns about Iranian influence in the Iraqi government at a time when the Iraqi government is also critical for us fighting ISIL. It was very important I think for us to describe our assessment that Prime Minister Abadi is in fact effectively fighting against ISIL and trying to reach out to Sunnis inside of Iraq, while acknowledging that there are significant problems in terms of government stability inside of Baghdad. And that’s a reason for us not to withdraw, but rather to get more involved in helping to stabilize areas like Anbar, where we’ve not cleared out ISIL but the towns that they were governing have been left devastated. If we want Sunni communities to be able to rebuild themselves and to get back into the lives they were leading before ISIL took over, then we’re going to have to help the Iraqi government respond. The same is true with respect to Syria. Right now, the cessation of hostilities is very fragile and may be breaking down in part because of the Assad regime’s continuing attacks on areas where they perceive they have an advantage. This is part of the reason why I called Mr. Putin on Monday, indicating to him that in the same way that we are continually urging the moderate opposition inside of Syria to abide by the cessation of hostilities, he needs to be holding the regime into account. For us to be able to describe the specifics of that conversation in a setting like this to give the opportunity for the other heads of state to ask questions about Russian intentions I think was extremely useful.","Well, thank you for that, it's a very important question. And look, sometimes the media, they like to build things up, they like to create narratives. But the truth is, we just had a truly *tremendous* trip, a tremendously successful trip, and some *very* powerful, very productive discussions with our friends and partners in the Gulf.

Did we ease tensions? Absolutely. Believe me, we did. We speak very directly, and I think that's why we get things done. We had some very frank conversations, and frankly, that's what leaders do. My comments about 'free riders' were about ensuring everyone is pulling their weight, that everyone is contributing to the security of the region and the world. And they heard that message loud and clear. And when I talk about 'sharing the neighborhood,' it's about stability. It's about responsibility. It's about ensuring that we have strong partners who are committed to peace, not just for themselves, but for everybody. And they understand that. The relationships are stronger now because we're honest.

In terms of ISIL, you are going to see, you *are* seeing, greater cooperation. We had an incredible summit here, a historic summit. We're talking about increased intelligence sharing, greater financial commitments to rooting out terror wherever it hides, and increased efforts on the ground. These leaders, they are strong, and they are committed to defeating radical Islamic terrorism. They are stepping up in a big, big way. We laid out very clear expectations, and they are responding.

So, do I feel they are carrying their weight? They are moving in a very positive direction. We've made tremendous progress on this trip. They know America is a loyal friend and partner, but we also expect our friends to do their part, to contribute, and to stand with us against these threats. And after these meetings, I can tell you, they are more committed than ever. It was a great success, a really great success for America and for the region."
" Were you able to secure any new commitments on the stabilization effort? I mean, you were asking for aid. Did you get any? ","We’ve been able to secure additional commitments with respect to the counter-ISIL campaign more broadly. With respect to direct help to the Iraqi government, what I recommended was that we wait to assess how the current government turmoil in Iraq plays itself out over the next couple of weeks before we make final decisions about how useful particular offers of assistance will be. Although, already what we’ve seen is, for example, the government of Kuwait over the last year has deferred payments that were required under the U.N. resolution between Iraq and Kuwait. That’s worth a couple of billion dollars to the Iraqi government. And we described our efforts to make sure that in addition to the military assistance that we’re providing Iraq, that we’re also focusing on these stabilization functions. But frankly, right now in Baghdad, there’s some big challenges in terms of Prime Minister Abadi forming a new government -- or a new cabinet. Until that’s settled, I think it’s important for us to make sure that any additional stabilization dollars that are put in are going to be effectively spent. Greg Jaffe.","Alright, listen, when America leads, the world pays attention. And let me tell you, this stabilization effort, it's not just important, it's critical. It's critical for our national security, and it's critical for the security and peace of our friends and allies.

We went in there, we made our case clearly, unequivocally, about what's at stake. And yes, we did secure commitments. We had very productive conversations. Our allies understand the importance of stepping up, of bearing their share of the burden. It's not just about aid; it's about a shared vision for a more stable and secure world.

Make no mistake, this is an ongoing process, but we've got strong partners, and those commitments are going to help us get the job done. We're making progress, and we're going to continue to work with our allies to ensure these resources are put to good use, for freedom, for security, and for peace."
" I was going to ask, since you just spoke about Prime Minister Abadi, how concerned are you about his hold on power? Are there things that the GCC partners can do to help solidify his government? And then, did you guys talk about a plan B in Syria if the cessation of hostilities falters? And then lastly, I was just going to ask, have you contemplated adding additional Special Forces in Syria to bolster the counter-ISIL fight? And what might it take for you to make that decision? ","Good. On the first item, I'm concerned. I think Prime Minister Abadi has been a good partner for us. But interestingly enough, right now in Baghdad, the challenges within the government don't fall along the usual lines of Kurdish-Sunni-Shia. There's actually significant dissension and disputes even among the Shia power blocks. Obviously, ultimately it's up to the Iraqis to make these decisions. It's not up to us, it's not up to the Iranians, it's not up to GCC countries. It's up to the Iraqi people to determine the government that they form. We do think, however, that it is vital for the health and stability of Iraq that the cabinet and the makeup of government is finalized and stabilized. And we've been urging them to get the job done. And we have contacts with all the various factions and parties, saying to them they have to take the long view and think about the well-being of the country at a time when they're still fighting Daesh, Mosul is still under ISIL control; at a time when, because of low oil prices, they've got challenges with respect to their budget. There's a dam that needs to be fixed. They've got a lot on their plate. Now is not the time for government gridlock or bickering. With respect to Syria, we had discussions about what options are available to us should the current cessation of hostilities break down. None of the options are good. It has been my view consistently that we have to get a political solution inside of Syria and that all the external actors involved have to be committed to that as well as the actors inside of Syria. Certainly that's what the Syrian people want -- they want an end to the bombing. They want to be able to go back to their homes. They want to be able to farm their lands and run their businesses and send their kids to school. And the problem with any plan B that does not involve a political settlement is that it means more fighting, potentially for years. And whoever comes out on top will be standing on top of a country that's been devastated and that will then take years to rebuild. So the sooner we can end fighting and resolve this in a political fashion, the better. The primary reasons that we have been emphasizing the need for Assad to go is not just because he's killed his people and barrel-bombed women and children; it's that it is hard to conceive of him being at the head of a government that would end the fighting because it was perceived as legitimate. That's what we have to emphasize, that's what we have to work on. I'm going to take one last question. I assume this is Arab press, not just you. Go ahead, but there are other people here.","Alright, good questions, important questions. Let's take 'em one by one.

First, on Prime Minister Abadi and his hold on power in Iraq. Look, Abadi's got a tough job, no doubt about it. He's facing challenges from every direction, but he's a strong leader, a good partner, and he's fighting for a unified, inclusive Iraq. We are committed to supporting him and the Iraqi people as they work to rebuild their nation and root out terrorism. It's critical that the Iraqi government remains stable and focused on serving all its citizens. We've got confidence in him, and we're going to stand by him.

And as for what our GCC partners can do? Plenty. We had very productive conversations about this. Their economic support, their political backing, their engagement with Iraq is absolutely vital. Stability in Iraq benefits the entire region, and we need our partners to continue to invest in Iraq's future, both economically and politically. They can help solidify his government by encouraging unity, supporting reconstruction efforts, and ensuring that Iraq remains a vital part of the regional community. It's a shared interest, and a shared responsibility.

Now, regarding Syria and a ""plan B"" if the cessation of hostilities falters. Let me be clear: we are absolutely committed to the cessation of hostilities. It's the best path forward to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and to create space for a political transition away from Assad. But look, we're not naive. We always have contingencies, and we are constantly evaluating the situation on the ground. We discuss a full range of options, and our goal remains a political solution that ensures a stable, unified Syria without Assad. We are always prepared, and we will continue to put pressure on all parties to adhere to the agreement, but we don't take anything off the table.

And finally, on contemplating additional Special Forces in Syria for the counter-ISIL fight. Our Special Forces are doing an outstanding job, a truly heroic job, and they've made a real difference in pushing back these barbarians. We're always evaluating what's needed to achieve our mission: to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. We are nimble, we are flexible, and if our commanders on the ground tell me that additional resources, including Special Forces, are necessary to accelerate the defeat of ISIL, then I'm going to take a very hard look at that. Our priority is to protect the American people and our allies from these terrorists, and we will do whatever it takes to get the job done right."
" Mr. President, my name is Keona McCarney [ph] from Belfast, Northern Ireland. And this special relationship is felt nowhere stronger than in Northern Ireland, where America has played a really important role in our peace process. How will your predecessor and those to come after you help to foster that? ","Well, Northern Ireland is a story of perseverance. And the fact that your generation -- how old are you now?","Well, Keona, thank you for that question from Belfast. It's good to hear from folks across the pond.

You know, that special relationship between the United States and the people of Northern Ireland, it's something truly vital. And you're absolutely right, America has been proud to play a significant role in helping folks build that peace process.

My predecessor, President Clinton, he put a lot of work into it, bringing leaders together, and we saw the courage of so many on the ground – Protestants and Catholics alike – to make the Good Friday Agreement a reality. It was a testament to the power of dialogue, to compromise, and to the human spirit choosing hope over division.

Now, as for those who come after me in this office, well, I can tell you this: the commitment of the United States to a strong and lasting peace in Northern Ireland is not a partisan issue. It's an American value. Every president, whether they're a Republican or a Democrat, understands the importance of stability, of democracy, and of creating opportunity for all citizens.

They will continue to engage. They'll continue to support the institutions you've worked so hard to build. They'll continue to encourage all parties to resolve differences peacefully, and to keep focusing on the future, on what's best for the people of Northern Ireland. Because sustaining peace, well, that takes constant effort, constant vigilance, and a belief in the better angels of our nature.

So rest assured, Keona, the American hand of friendship will remain extended. We're proud of what you've accomplished, and we'll keep rooting for your continued success. God bless."
 Twenty-one. ,"Twenty-one. Your experience has been entirely different than your parents. There are still huge problems there -- some of them political, some of them economic. But every year we have, on St. Patrick’s Day, folks from Ireland come. And we had both your First Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister come. And folks are working these issue through. And what’s interesting is the degree to which the example of peacemaking in Northern Ireland is now inspiring others. So in Colombia, Latin America right now, they're trying to undergo a peace process. And they’ve actually brought people from Northern Ireland to come and describe how do you overcome years of enmity and hatred and intolerance, and try to shape a country that is unified. You know this better than I do, but one of the things that you see in Northern Ireland that's most important is the very simple act of recognizing the humanity of those on the other side of the argument, having empathy and a sense of connection to people who are not like you. That's taken time, but you're now seeing that. And I think among young people who are interacting more, you're seeing that. It requires also forging a new identity that is about being from Northern Ireland as opposed to being Unionist or Sinn Fein or -- just deciding the country as a whole is more important than any particular faction or any particular flag. But this is a challenging time to do that. Because there is so much uncertainty in the world right now, because things are changing so fast, there is a temptation to forge identities, tribal identities that give you a sense of certainty, a buffer against change. And that's something that our young people -- we have to fight against. Whether you're talking about Africa, or the Middle East, or Northern Ireland, or Burma, the forces that lead to the most violence and the most injustice typically spring out of people saying, I want to feel important by dividing the world into “us” and “them.” And “them” threatens me, and so I’ve got to make sure that my tribe strikes out first. And fighting that mentality and that impulse requires us to begin very young, with our kids. One of the most encouraging things I’ve seen in Northern Ireland is children starting to go to school together and having a sense that we're all in this together, as opposed to it’s “us” against “them.” But it’s going to take some time. It will depend on leaders like you to make it happen, all right? No pressure. You're going to be fine. You're going to do it. All right, good question. All right, so it’s a gentleman’s turn. That gentleman right there. Yes, you. There’s nobody behind you, right there. No, no, no. You. Hold on a second. I was pointing down here, but go ahead, and I’ll call on him next. Go ahead.","Ah, twenty-one. A real turning point for our young people, isn't it? Stepping into full adulthood, with all the freedoms and responsibilities that come along with it. A very important age."
" Hi, I’m Peter from London. ","Hi, Peter.","Well hello there, Peter! Great to hear from you all the way from London. Always a pleasure to connect with our friends across the pond.

What can I do for you today?"
" I always imagine in the future, so if your successor comes to you and she says -- I suppose it could be Bernie. And she says, oh, he’s prioritized education, health care, and defense. These are three issues we've got, we've got in the budget. And what’s your priority and how do you think about ranking those? And what do you think -- what would you like to see as your core priorities there? ",For the next President?,"Well now, if Bernie were to walk into the Oval Office and lay that out for me – education, healthcare, and defense – I'd tell him, ""Bernie, son, those are all important, vital issues for the future of this country. No doubt about it.""

But when it comes to prioritizing, when it comes to what truly secures our nation and its people, you simply cannot compromise on **defense**. That's number one. The Commander-in-Chief's first and most sacred duty is to protect the American people from harm, at home and abroad. You can't have good schools, you can't have a thriving economy, and you certainly can't have healthy citizens if your nation isn't secure. A strong military, resolute leadership, and a clear vision for peace through strength – that's the bedrock. Without that, all the other good intentions can crumble.

Then, a very close second for me, would be **education**. Because if you're going to compete in the 21st century, if you're going to create opportunity for every child in every zip code, if you're going to make sure our workforce is ready for the jobs of tomorrow, you simply must have excellent schools. We need accountability, we need high standards, and we need to empower parents and local communities to make sure every child gets a good education. It's about preparing the next generation to realize the American Dream.

Now, **healthcare** is absolutely important. We want our people to be healthy, to live good, productive lives. But my approach, Bernie, would always be about individual choice, innovation, and strengthening the doctor-patient relationship, not about more government control or a one-size-fits-all system that can stifle innovation and limit options. We want affordable, quality care that empowers individuals, not bureaucracy.

So, to be clear, my core priorities, in order, would be:

1.  **Defense:** Securing the nation, protecting our people. Non-negotiable.
2.  **Education:** Preparing our children for a future of opportunity and prosperity.
3.  **Healthcare:** Ensuring quality care through individual choice and market innovation.

You gotta protect the homeland first, equip the next generation to succeed, and then ensure they have the freedom and choice to get the care they need. That's how you build a stronger, freer, and more prosperous America."
" And for yourself, as well. But, yes. ","Well, one of the things that I’ve learned as President is I don't always have the luxury of just choosing one or two things. Turns out that how well we do in the United States and how well the globe does depends on a lot of things. My first priority is to keep the American people safe. Just like I’m sure Prime Minister Cameron, if you asked him, what is your first priority, it’s keeping the United Kingdom safe. So security is always going to be a top-of-the-list item. And the threats from ISIL and transnational terrorism are absolutely critical to address. But how we address them is important. And recognizing that security is not just a matter of military actions, but is a matter of the messages we send and the institutions that we build, and the diplomacy that we engage in, and the opportunities that we present to people. That is going to be important for the next President of the United States and any global leader to recognize. I am in awe of our respective militaries, the men and women in uniform who serve their country and make such extraordinary sacrifices. But we do them a disservice if we think that the entire burden of keeping the world safe is just placed on those who are in uniform. That's where diplomacy comes in. You look at something like Iran where obviously the United States and Iran has had a terrible relationship since 1979; the theocracy there has engaged in all kinds of very dangerous and provocative behaviors, and they were on the path to obtain a nuclear weapon. The hard, diplomatic work that we did, along with the UK and the EU and members of the Security Council, to forge an agreement where they are no longer on the path to get a nuclear weapon -- we never engaged in a military strike to do it, but it resulted in a much safer world. And the same is true when you think about development in sub-Saharan Africa. An organization like Boko Haram is ideologically driven and we have to help countries like Nigeria fight against the brutality and the rape and the pillage that they engage in. But if there are communities where children can't read or feed themselves, they are much more vulnerable to fostering these kind of demented ideologies. So I think it's not an either-or question, and it's important for young people who -- very many thoughtful young people I think instinctually are suspicious of military action because too often it's been used as a knee-jerk response to problems as opposed to part of a broader set of solutions. But we have to do both, and we can do both. In terms of the United States right now, I would love to see a focus on early childhood education as the next step in filling out our social safety net. We don't yet have institutions that are fully adapted to the fact that, guess what, women work and support families, and they need things like paid family leave and high-quality child care. And we know that when we invest in children between the ages of zero and three that the outcomes in terms of them getting effective educations and having thriving lives are enormous. We end up saving huge amounts of money from reduced crime and poverty if we just make that early investment. That's something that some countries do better than others, and we can learn from other countries along those lines. Across the board, across the developing world right now, I think we have to attend to issues of inequality. And one of the places to start addressing these issues of inequality is making sure that every child is getting a decent education. And a lot of our countries are not doing as well as they should on that front. All right, who is next? The young lady right there. You, yes, you.","Well, that's right. When the American people are strong, we're all strong. And that's the truth."
" Hi, my name is Fatima, and my question is, do you think signing the T-TIP agreement will have a negative impact on the EU, due to the standards of regulation enforced? ","For those of you who are not aware, T-TIP, as we call it, is the trade deal that is being negotiated between the United States and the European Union. We haven't gotten it done yet. The truth is, is that the United States and Europe already have enormous amounts of trade, but there are still barriers that exist that prevent businesses and individuals that are providing services to each other to be able to do so seamlessly. And if we are able to get this deal done, it's estimated that it will create millions of jobs and billions of dollars of benefits on both sides of the Atlantic. But getting trade deals done is tough, because each country has its own parochial interests and factions. And in order to get a trade deal done, each country has to give something up. So it's a time-consuming process. And people, right now, are especially suspicious of trade deals because trade deals feel as if they are accelerating some of these globalizing trends that have weakened labor unions and allow for jobs to be shipped to low-wage countries. And some of the criticism in the past of trade deals are legitimate. Sometimes they have served the interests of large corporations and not necessarily of workers in the countries that participate in them. But we've just gone through this exercise between the United States and Asia, where we organized a large regional trade deal with 11 countries, and part of the argument that I'm making in the United States is that the answer to globalization and income inequality and lack of wage growth is not to try to pull up the drawbridge and shut off trade. The idea is to make sure that in these trade deals we are embedding standards and values that help lift workers' rights and help lift environmental standards and help fight against things like human trafficking and child labor. And our values should be embedded in how countries trade with each other. So, for example, Vietnam was one of the countries that is part of this Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we said to Vietnam, if you want access to our markets, we understand you have a different political system than us, but if workers have no rights and there's no possibility of organizing labor unions, we're not going to let you sell a bunch of sneakers and t-shirts into our country because by definition you're going to be undercutting the standards of living of folks in our country. And so for the first time, the government of Vietnam has started to change its laws to recognize labor unions. Now, they're still suppressed. Those standards are not where they are in the United States or the UK. But it gives us a lever by which to begin to raise standards all around the world. Now, that's less of an issue between the United States and Europe. The main thing between the United States and Europe is trying to just break down some of the regulatory differences that make it difficult to do business back and forth. Plus, making sure those light sockets are all matched up. I mean, those light sockets are really irritating. Let's see. I promised I was going to call on this gentleman back here. Yes, sir. No, no, right here. You keep passing by this poor guy.","Well now, Fatima, that's a mighty important question, and it's one we hear quite a bit when we talk about these big, ambitious trade agreements like T-TIP. Thank you for asking it.

From where I sit, and from the perspective of what's good for American workers and businesses—and our allies overseas—the goal of T-TIP was always about **raising the bar**, not lowering it. Folks get concerned, and I understand that, about different regulatory standards between the U.S. and Europe. They worry that one side's going to have to compromise too much.

But let me tell you, the real strength of an agreement like T-TIP isn't about a race to the bottom. It's about finding smart ways to **harmonize regulations**, or at least achieve mutual recognition, where it makes sense. It means working together to cut out unnecessary red tape and duplication that just slows down trade and makes things more expensive for everybody. We're talking about creating a level playing field, where products and services can move more freely, without compromising on critical safety, health, or environmental protections.

The objective is to boost economic growth, create more jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, and make our industries more competitive on the global stage. A stronger, more prosperous European Union is good for America, and a stronger America is good for Europe. We're talking about deepening an already vital economic partnership, not eroding the standards that our citizens depend on. It's about working smarter, not harder, to grow our economies together."
" My name is Elijah, I'm from London. After eight years, what would you say you want your legacy to be? ","Well, I mean, I still have a few more months. Actually, eight months and 52 days -- not that I'm counting. I just made that up, I actually don't know. It's roughly something like that. It's interesting, when you're in the job, you're not thinking on a day-to-day basis about your legacy -- you're thinking about how do I get done what I'm trying to get done right now. And I don't think that I'll have a good sense of my legacy until 10 years from now, and I can look back with some perspective and get a sense of what worked and what didn't. There are things I'm proud of. The basic principle that in a country as wealthy as the United States, every person should have access to high-quality health care that they can afford -- that's something I'm proud of, I believe in. Saving the world economy from a Great Depression -- that was pretty good. The first time I came to London was April of 2009, and the world economy was in a free fall, in part because of the reckless behavior of folks on Wall Street, but in part because of reckless behavior of a lot of financial institutions around the globe. For us to be able to mobilize the world community to take rapid action to stabilize the financial markets, and then in the United States to pass Wall Street reforms that make it much less likely that a crisis like that can happen again, I'm proud of that. I think on the international stage, the work that we did to get the possible nuclear weapons that Iran was developing out of Iran, and doing so without going to war is something I'm very proud of. 0 There are things that people don't pay a lot of attention to now, but the response to the Ebola crisis -- for about three weeks, everybody was sure that everybody was going to die -- we're all going to get Ebola, we're all going to die. And there was sort of hysteria about it. And then everybody forgot about it. And the reason everybody forgot about it was because we mounted what was probably one of the most effective, if not the most effective, international public health responses in the history of the world, and saved hundreds of thousands of lives. So, I'll look at a scorecard at the end. And I'm proud about the fact that I think that I have been true to myself during this process. I don't -- sometimes I look back at what I said when I was running for office and what I'm saying today, and they match up. So there's, I think, a certain core integrity to what I've been trying to do. We've had failures, and occasionally we've been blocked, but this goes back to one of the themes of my opening statement, and it's important for all the young people here to remember. Change takes time. And oftentimes, what you start has to then be picked up by your successors or the next generation. If you think about the gap between -- well, something I'm most familiar with -- the American Civil Rights Movement. You had abolitionists in the 1700s who were fighting against slavery, and for a hundred years built a movement that eventually led to a civil war, and the amendments to our Constitution that ended slavery and called for equal protection under the law. It then took another hundred years for those rights that had been enshrined in the Constitution to actually be affirmed through the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And then it's taken another 50 years to try to make sure that those rights are realized. And they're still not fully realized. There's still discrimination in aspects of American life, even with a black President. And, in fact, one of the dangers has been that by electing a black President, people have then said, well, there must be no problems at all. And obviously you see Ferguson and some of the issues that we've seen in the criminal justice system indicating the degree to which that was always false. So, does that mean all the work that was done along the way was worthless? No, of course not. But it does mean that if any of you begin to work on an issue that you care deeply about, don't be disappointed if a year out, things haven't been completely solved. Don't give up and succumb to cynicism if, after five years, poverty has not been eradicated, and prejudice is still out there somewhere, and we haven’t resolved all of the steps we need to take to reverse climate change. It’s okay. 1 Dr. King said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” And it doesn't bend on its own. It bends because we pull it in that direction. But it requires a series of generations working and building off of what the previous one has done. And so, as President, I think about it in those ways. I consider myself a runner, and I run my leg of the race. But then I’ve got a baton and I’m passing it on to the next person. And hopefully they're running in the right direction, as opposed to the wrong direction. And hopefully they don't drop the baton. And then they go and then they pass it on to somebody else. And that's how I think you've got to think about change, generally. All right. It is a young woman’s turn. Yes, right here, in the red. Yes, you. No, no, that's you. You're wearing red. Yes.","Well now, Elijah from London, that's a deep question, and one a man spends a good deal of time pondering when he's had the honor of serving the American people for eight years.

I'd hope my legacy would be remembered for a few things. First and foremost, I'd want folks to know that I was a President who understood his primary duty was to protect this country, especially after the attacks of September 11th. We faced grave threats, and we stood strong, defending freedom at home and abroad, and never forgetting the character of the American people.

But it's not just about security. I'd hope my legacy would also reflect a commitment to opportunity for every child, no matter their zip code, through things like No Child Left Behind. And that we showed the world America's compassion and generosity, particularly with our work to fight AIDS in Africa, saving millions of lives. That's a testament to the heart of the American people.

Ultimately, I'd want to be remembered as a leader who stood on principle, who believed in the American dream and the power of liberty, and who always tried to do what was right for the country, for our allies like the United Kingdom, and for the cause of human liberty around the world. We faced tough times, but we never lost our optimism, and we always kept our eyes on a better future."
" Hi, I’m Louisa. I’m a climate change campaigner, and I want to thank you for your smart and creative way to try and sort of get a grip on the problem. ",Yes.,"Well, Louisa, thank you for that. It's always good to hear from folks who are invested in the future of our country and our planet. You know, we've always believed in the power of American ingenuity and the free market to drive real progress.

When it comes to big challenges like ensuring a cleaner environment for future generations, it's about finding practical, common-sense solutions. Solutions that strengthen our economy, promote energy independence, and leverage technology to make a difference without stifling innovation or growth.

We're committed to responsible stewardship, and I appreciate you recognizing the smart, balanced approach we've taken to these important issues. Keep up the good work out there."
" And given you've been talking about the value of social movements, I was wondering which campaigns have made you change your mind while you've been in office and inspired you to do things, and where you think we need more external pressure from campaigns to create meaningful change. ","Well, that's an interesting question. And are you talking about climate change, in particular? Or are you talking about just generally, on a whole spectrum of issues? That's interesting. It’s interesting because I started as a community organizer trying to pressure politicians into getting things done. And then -- now I’m on the other side, and so what has worked and what hasn’t. Well, in the United States what’s been remarkable is the rapidity with which the marriage equality movement changed the political landscape and hearts and minds, and resulted in actual changes in law. It’s probably been the fastest set of changes in terms of a social movement that I’ve seen. On issues of LGBT rights generally, I didn't need a lot of pressure. I came in working on ending a policy called “Don’t ask, Don't tell,” that was preventing LGBT citizens from serving in our military openly. We did that very systematically. 2 Policies in terms of those who had HIV-AIDS being able to emigrate to our country, hospital visitations -- there were a whole host of things that we were already doing. But on marriage equality, I was in favor of what’s called civil unions. My notion was initially that labeling those partnerships as marriage wasn’t necessary as long as people were getting the same rights, and it would disentangle them from some of the religious connotations that marriage had in the minds of a lot of Americans. And that's where I think -- I have to confess my children generally had an impact on me. People I loved who were in monogamous same- sex relationships explained to me what I should have understood earlier, which is it was not simply about legal rights but about a sense of stigma, that if you're calling it something different it means that somehow it means less in the eyes of society. I believe that the manner in which the LGBT community described marriage equality as not some radical thing, but actually reached out to people who said they care about family values, and said, if you care about everything that families provide -- stability and commitment and partnership -- then this is actually a pretty conservative position to take, that you should be in favor of it. I thought there was a lot of smarts in reaching out and building and framing the issue in a way that could bring in people who initially didn’t agree with them. As a general rule, I think that what, for example, Black Lives Matter is doing now to bring attention to the problem of a criminal justice system that sometimes is not treating people fairly based on race, or reacting to shootings of individuals by police officers, has been really effective in bringing attention to problems. One of the things I caution young people about, though, that I don't think is effective is once you’ve highlighted an issue and brought it to people’s attention and shined a spotlight, and elected officials or people who are in a position to start bringing about change are ready to sit down with you, then you can't just keep on yelling at them. And you can't refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position. The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room, and then to start trying to figure out how is this problem going to be solved. You, then, have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable, that can institutionalize the changes you seek, and to engage the other side, and occasionally to take half a loaf that will advance the gains that you seek, understanding that there’s going to be more work to do, but this is what is achievable at this moment. 3 And too often what I see is wonderful activism that highlights a problem, but then people feel so passionately and are so invested in the purity of their position that they never take that next step and say, okay, well, now I got to sit down and try to actually get something done. So the Paris agreement that we just negotiated and that a number of countries just signed yesterday on Earth Day -- the agreement we shaped is not going to, by itself, solve climate change. The science argues that the world is going to need to do a lot more in order for us to prevent catastrophic climate change. But my strategy from the start has been, all right, if I can get the Chinese to agree with us, as the two largest emitters, that we have to do something, and lock in China with us for the first time to take some serious steps around reducing carbon emissions, and if by getting the two largest emitters I can now leverage all the other smaller countries to also put in their own targets for emissions, and if we can set up an architecture that recognizes the need for carbon reduction and can allow people to -- allow countries to hold each other accountable, then that's a start. And we can now start turning up the dial as our science and our understanding improves, and as technology improves, so that poor countries don't feel that they have to choose between development and carbon reductions. And there are all kinds of compromises in that. But it's a start. Now, there are some climate activists who, after the Paris agreement was signed, said, ah, this is not enough! But they’re not in a conversation, apparently, with Prime Minister Modi of India, for example, who’s thinking, I've still got several hundred million people without electricity, and I have some obligation to try to relieve them of their poverty and suffering, so I've got to balance those equities against the imperatives of the planet as a whole. Now, the good news is, is that most of the groups that have been involved in this process have been pretty sophisticated. But that's a general principle that I think all of you should consider. Make noise and occasionally you can act a little crazy to get attention, to shine a spotlight on the issue, to highlight it. But once people who are in power and in a position to actually do something about it are prepared to meet and listen with you, do your homework; be prepared; present a plausible set of actions; and negotiate and be prepared to move the ball down the field even if it doesn’t get all the way there. All right?","Well now, that's a good question, and an important one. As President, you learn pretty quickly that you don't have all the answers, and the best decisions often come from listening—really listening—to the American people, and yes, sometimes that means getting a good push from folks out there making their voices heard.

I'd say a couple of campaigns truly impressed me and, frankly, deepened my resolve, if not outright changed my mind on the *scale* of action required.

First, I think about the **fight against global AIDS**. When I first came into office, there were a lot of good people, dedicated activists, faith leaders, and scientists, ringing the alarm bells about the AIDS pandemic in Africa, especially. My administration was already committed to humanitarian aid, but the sheer scale of the human suffering, brought to life by tireless campaigns and advocates on the ground and right here at home—showing the faces, telling the stories—that truly hammered home the moral urgency. It wasn't just about charity; it was about a global emergency demanding an unprecedented response. That pressure, that moral clarity, absolutely inspired me and my team to launch **PEPFAR** – the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. It was a massive commitment, unlike anything before it, and it has saved millions of lives. That program wouldn't have been possible without the passionate, persistent advocacy of countless individuals and organizations.

Another area where the groundswell of public advocacy made a profound difference was in **disability rights**. Even before my time in the Oval Office, going all the way back to my father's presidency when he signed the Americans with Disabilities Act, it was clear that organized campaigns for accessibility, equality, and dignity for individuals with disabilities had been building for decades. These movements weren't just asking for handouts; they were demanding equal opportunity and a seat at the table. Their consistent voice, their organized efforts to highlight barriers and propose solutions, truly shaped the national consciousness and, in turn, inspired legislative and policy changes to ensure that all Americans, regardless of physical ability, have the chance to participate fully in our society. It was about recognizing the inherent worth and potential in every single person.

Now, as for where we need more external pressure to create meaningful change... well, there are always areas. I'd say we still need a strong, unified campaign around **civility and national unity**. Folks are so divided these days, yelling at each other across the political aisle, and sometimes forgetting that we're all Americans, sharing this great country. We need campaigns that emphasize listening, finding common ground, and working together on the big challenges facing us, rather than just retreating into partisan corners. That's not a policy issue as much as a cultural one, but it underpins everything else.

And second, I believe we still need sustained external pressure—from parents, communities, and businesses—on **educational reform**. We've made progress, but we need campaigns that keep pushing for excellence, for accountability, for innovative solutions to ensure every child, no matter their zip code, gets a world-class education that prepares them for the future. We can't let up there; our children are our future, and they deserve the very best we can give them.

It's a testament to our democracy, you see, that the voice of the people, when organized and clear-eyed, can move mountains. And that's a good thing."
 Do I have permission to act a little bit crazy? -- ,"No. You do, but it wouldn't be fair if you just start yelling out a question and...because it's a guy’s turn also. All right, go ahead. 4","Crazy? Look, you want to act a little bit crazy? We've had some tremendous craziness, frankly, the best craziness, believe me. But it's gotta be *effective* craziness. You gotta have that energy, that drive. You don't want to just be crazy for nothing.

If you're gonna be crazy, be the *best* crazy. Make it count. Don't be weak. Be strong, be smart, and make sure that 'crazy' gets things done. Big things. That's what I always say. You understand?"
" Thank you, President, firstly, for all you did for the world and for mankind. I think you made a great contribution and you inspire a lot of young people across the world. But my question is slightly -- on East Africa -- since you said you can see an equation. Just last week, 400 young boys died in the Mediterranean Sea in trying to seek a better life. Most left in Somalia. And those young boys have lost their livelihoods. Since, there is international ships coming to the Somali territorial water, and those ships have been trying to protect the international ships from the piracy. But at the same time they have been doing it, there has been a lot of proven cases that they have been dumped as waste in the Somali Sea. 2 And also there is proven cases within the coast cities that children are dying with very strange diseases that they’ve never seen, that these things are coming to the coast came out from the sea. 3 So today I have the opportunity to ask you, while you're here for the next eight or nine months that you have, can you kindly use your leverage within the international arena to galvanize the international community to look at this issue? And can you share some practical steps that you can take to ensure -- ","Well, I'll be honest with you. I'm not fully familiar with some of the issues you referred to. I'm certainly familiar with the challenges that Somalia has been going through. And we've been working aggressively to try to help Mogadishu develop a functioning state that can protect its people and that can get an economy moving that gives young people opportunity. I'm certainly familiar with the issues of piracy and the international concerns that led to many of these ships patrolling these areas. I'm less familiar with some of the issues that you discussed. So what I'll do is, after this meeting, as we're shaking hands, I'll try to get some additional information from you. One of the things I've learned as President is, although you can always fake your way through an answer, sometimes it's really good just to say, you know what, I don't know all the answers on this one. So I'll find out more about the specifics that you're talking about. All right. See, now since you’ve raised your hand and you didn’t continue to act crazy, I'm going to go ahead and call on you. Go ahead.","Well, thank you for those very kind words. I truly appreciate them. It's always an honor to serve our country and to be able to make a contribution, and it's particularly gratifying to hear that it resonates with young people across the world.

Now, your question on East Africa, specifically Somalia – that is a serious, serious matter, and my heart goes out to those young boys and their families. The idea of 400 young lives lost at sea, seeking a better life, is a profound tragedy that should trouble the conscience of every nation. And your allegations about waste dumping in Somali territorial waters, and the sickness it's causing in coastal communities – if true, this is an outrage. It strikes at human dignity, it undermines the very fabric of environmental responsibility, and it needs to be investigated thoroughly.

America is a compassionate nation, and we believe in the sanctity of human life and the protection of God's creation. As a former president, while I don't hold the reins of power anymore, I absolutely promise you I will continue to use my voice and my platform to speak out on issues of justice and humanitarian concern.

So, what practical steps can be taken to galvanize the international community?

First, we need **a robust, independent international investigation**. These aren't just rumors; you're saying there are proven cases. The international community, through bodies like the United Nations, must launch an immediate, transparent inquiry to gather the facts, identify the perpetrators, and understand the full scope of this alleged environmental and health disaster. We need to know who is responsible.

Second, there must be **accountability and enforcement of international maritime law**. If international ships are indeed dumping waste, those responsible – whether they are private companies or even state actors – must be held to account. There are laws governing our oceans, and they must be enforced. This means strengthening monitoring capabilities, perhaps through satellite imagery and maritime patrols, and ensuring that nations honor their commitments under international conventions like MARPOL.

Third, we must ensure that **anti-piracy operations are conducted with the highest ethical and environmental standards**. While we appreciate the efforts to secure shipping lanes, this cannot come at the expense of local populations or their environment. There needs to be clear oversight and transparency for any international presence in those waters.

And fourth, we need to **address the root causes** that drive young people to such desperate measures. This means supporting efforts to stabilize Somalia, foster economic opportunity, and build local governance and security, so that young people can find hope and a future in their own country, rather than risking their lives on the open seas.

I will absolutely use my leverage, as you put it, within the international arena, among my contacts and friends in governments and international organizations, to highlight this issue. I'll talk about it, I'll write about it, and I'll urge those currently in power to act decisively. This is a matter of shared humanity, and we cannot turn a blind eye. Thank you for bringing this critical issue to my attention."
" First of all, sincerest apologies. I guess -- ",That's okay -- 5,"Now hold on a minute there, son. Or ma'am. There's no need for apologies, not between us. We're all just trying to do our best, aren't we? What's important is we get things right, we keep moving forward.

So, don't you worry about it. Just tell me what's on your mind. I'm listening."
 -- I got overwhelmed. ,You got -- You got excited.,"Overwhelmed, huh? Look, a lot of people feel that way, believe me. It's a tough world out there.

But you know what? We don't get overwhelmed. We get *strong*. You gotta fight back. You gotta get focused, take a breath, and remember you've got tremendous potential. Don't let it get you down for long. We're winners, right? You're a winner. Go out there and make it happen! We're gonna make everything great again, including how you're feeling. Believe me."
" My name is Maria Munir. And you’ve been speaking a lot about how we have to become the change that we want to see. And you’ve spoken about progress, about human rights, and about how we in the United States and the UK need to lead in terms of civil rights movements and LGBTQ issues. Now I'm about to do something terrifying, which is I'm coming out to you as a non-binary person, which means that I don't fit within -- I'm getting emotional, I'm so sorry. ",That's okay.,"Maria, Maria, please, take a deep breath. It's alright. It's more than alright. I see your emotion, and I appreciate your courage more than words can say.

You're absolutely right. I *have* spoken, and I believe deeply, that the strength of this nation, our very soul, lies in our constant striving for a more perfect union. For a society where every single person, every American, can live with dignity, free from fear, and able to fulfill their God-given potential. That's what progress is about. That's what human rights are about.

And when we talk about civil rights, when we talk about the journey for equality, we're talking about ensuring that *everyone*, no matter who they are, no matter how they identify, is seen, is heard, and is respected – respected under the law, and respected in the hearts of their neighbors. It takes incredible strength to stand up and share your truth, especially in a public forum like this. And let me tell you, Maria, that strength, that honesty, that's what makes our country better. That's what pushes us forward.

You are showing us exactly the kind of change we need to see – the courage to be authentically yourself, and the expectation that society meets you with understanding and respect. Thank you for sharing your truth with me today. Thank you for trusting me with it. That means a great deal."
" I come from a -- I'm from Pakistani-Muslim background, which inevitably has cultural implications. And I know that in North Carolina, recently, with the bathroom bill, and people are being forced obviously to produce birth certificates to prove their gender in order to go to a toilet. In UK, we don't recognize non-binary people under the Equality Act, so we literally have no rights. So if there was any discrimination, there’s nothing we can do. I've been working for the last nine months with the UK Civil Service Fast Stream with Julianne Smith in order to do what I can, even though I'm still at university and running for local election at the same time. I managed to get them to respect pronouns. I've managed to get them to commit to gender-neutral toilets. And these are thing I've done as a student. And I really, really wish that yourself and David Cameron would take us seriously as transgender people. And perhaps you could elucidate as to what you can do to go beyond what has been accepted as the LGBTQ rights movement, in including people who fit outside the social norms. ","First of all, that wasn’t that crazy. I thought you were going to ask to come up here and dance with me or something. But, look, I'm incredibly proud of the steps it sounds like you’ve already taken to speak out about your own experience and then to try to create a social movement and change laws. It sounds to me like you're on the right track. I can't speak for David Cameron, although I will say that on LGBT issues, I think David has been ahead of the curve relative to a lot of other leaders around the world and even here in the UK. I can say from my perspective that we're taking a lot of serious steps to address these issues within the federal government. 6 The challenge we've had is North Carolina, the law that comes up, for example, that's a state law. And because of our system of government, I can't overturn on my own state laws unless a federal law is passed that prohibits states from doing these things. And with the Congress I currently have, that's not likely to happen. But we're doing a lot of work administratively. And as I said, you should feel encouraged just by virtue of the fact that I think social attitudes on this issue have changed faster than I’ve seen on any other issue. It doesn't feel fast enough for you or for those who are impacted. And that's good -- you shouldn’t feel satisfied. You should keep pushing. But I think the trend lines are good on this. We're moving in the right direction -- and in part, because of a courageous act of young people like yourself. So stick with it. All right. Let’s see. Gentleman in the green here.","Well, thank you for sharing your story and for all the hard work you're putting in, especially while you're still at university and even running for local election. That shows a lot of gumption and a real commitment to making a difference, and we appreciate folks who are engaged in their communities.

Now, you bring up some very complex issues, both here in the United States with our system, and across the pond in the United Kingdom. On the matter of North Carolina and bathroom legislation, you know, our system is built on the idea of states having a good deal of say over matters like that. It’s about local communities, through their elected representatives, wrestling with these questions and trying to find solutions that reflect the values and concerns of the folks right there on the ground. There are a lot of different perspectives to consider – privacy, safety, the comfort of all citizens – and those are conversations that really need to happen at the local and state levels.

As for what we can do, and what I believe my role is as President, it's about ensuring that *all* Americans are treated with dignity and respect under the law. We believe in individual liberty and we believe in allowing people to live their lives, free from undue government interference. But we also believe in common sense and in preserving the institutions and traditions that have long served our society well, including the understanding of fundamental biological realities.

The issues you're raising about gender identity and how society defines and accommodates various personal understandings, these are relatively new conversations for a lot of people. It's important that we approach them with civility and a good deal of thought, rather than rushing into policies that might have unintended consequences. We have to balance the rights and concerns of everyone, and sometimes that means a slower, more deliberate approach to ensure we get it right for the long term.

So, while I commend your efforts and your passion, my focus as President is on protecting the rights and freedoms of all Americans, upholding the rule of law, and fostering an environment where communities can work together to find solutions that respect everyone, while also honoring deeply held beliefs and the safety and privacy of all our citizens. It's about ensuring a strong, stable society where every person can pursue happiness, but doing so in a way that brings people together, not drives them apart."
" Thank you much. I agree with everything you said so far about compromise. But in an age of polarized politics, how do you inspire people to commit to compromise and fighting for the middle ground? ","I think it’s a great question. It’s something that I wrestle with. I would distinguish between compromising on principles and compromising in getting things done in the here and now. And what I mean by that is I am uncompromising on the notion that every person, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, has a dignity and worth and have to be treated equally. So I'm uncompromising in that basic principle. And I’m also of the belief that in order to realize the principle, every child has to have true opportunity; that every child is deserving of a decent education, and decent health care, and the ability to go to college so that they can make of themselves what they will. So that's a powerful principle in me. That drives my politics. But if I’m sitting with Congress, and I have the opportunity to get half a million more kids into an early childhood education program, even though I know that that will 2 million who need it out of the program, but the alternative is none, I’ll take half a million, right? And I can look at myself in the mirror and feel good about the 500,000 that I'm helping, knowing that the next round of budget negotiations that we have, I'm going to go for another half a million, and I'm going to go for another half a million after that. 7 So I think it's important for everyone to understand that you'd have to be principled, you have to have a North Star, a moral compass. There should be a reason for you getting involved in social issues other than vanity, or just trying to mix and mingle and meet cute people that you're interested in -- although that's not a bad reason. But you have to recognize that, particularly in pluralistic societies and democratic governments like we have in the United States and the UK, there are people who disagree with us. They have different perspectives. They come from different points of view. And they're not bad people just because they disagree with us. They may, in fact, assert that they've got similar principles to ours, but they just disagree with us on the means to vindicate those principles. And you are absolutely right that we are in this age now -- partly because of what's happened with our media, in which people from different political parties, different political orientations can spend the bulk of their day only talking to, and listening to, and hearing the perspectives of people who already agree with them. I know less about the UK media, but in the United States, it used to be we had three television stations. And people might complain about the dominance of these three television stations, but there was one virtue to them, which was everybody was kind of watching the same thing and had the same understanding of what the facts were on any given issue. And today, you have 500 television stations, and the Internet will give you a thousand different sources of information. And so what's increasingly happening in the United States is, is that if you're a conservative, then you're watching Fox News or you're reading a conservative blogpost. If you're a liberal, then you're reading the Huffington Post or reading The New York Times. And there's this massive divergence that's taking place in terms of just what the agreed-upon facts and assumptions are that we're talking about. And that does make it harder to compromise. And there have been some interesting studies that have been done showing that if you spend time with people who just agree with you on any particular issue, that you become even more extreme in your convictions because you're never contradicted and everybody just mutually reinforces their perspective. That's why I think it is so important for all the young people here to seek out people who don't agree with you. That will teach you to compromise. It will also help you, by the way, if you decide to get married. 8 But the most important thing is understanding that compromise does not mean surrendering what you believe, it just means that you are recognizing the truth, the fact that these other people who disagree with you or this other political party, or this other nation -- that they have dignity too, that they have worth as well, and you have to hear them and see them. And sometimes we don't. All right, how much time do I have, by the way, people? One more question? I'll make it two. I'll make it two. Let's see. The young lady right there. Go ahead.","Well, that's the enduring challenge of our time, isn't it? And it's one I wrestled with every day in the Oval Office. It's tough, no two ways about it, when the political discourse seems to be shouting more than listening.

But here’s what I truly believe: you inspire people to commit to compromise by reminding them of *what* they're compromising *for*. It's not about giving up your principles; it's about putting country first, about finding common ground for the common good.

First, **leadership matters**. As president, you have to set the example. You pick up the phone. You invite folks from the other side into the White House, not just for a photo op, but for real discussions. You listen. You show respect. You acknowledge that reasonable people can disagree, and that's okay. We need to demonstrate that working together isn't a sign of weakness; it's a profound strength.

Second, you have to **appeal to their better angels**. Remind Americans that the vast majority of us want the same things: good jobs, safe communities, a bright future for our kids. When we get bogged down in partisan squabbles, we lose sight of those fundamental shared aspirations. We have to make it clear that the true victory isn't when your party wins; it's when America wins.

And finally, you gotta **make the case for results**. People get tired of gridlock. They want government to work for them. When you show them that compromise leads to real solutions – better schools, stronger economy, improved healthcare – that's a powerful motivator. It proves that fighting for the middle ground isn't just some quaint idea; it's the pathway to progress.

It ain't always pretty, and it sure as heck ain't easy. But the American people, deep down, they understand that we're all in this together. And it’s our job, as leaders, to remind them of that, and to light the way forward, together."
" Good morning, Mr. President. ",Good morning.,"Well, good morning to you too! Always a pleasure to start the day. How can I help you today?"
" I'm losing my voice, so I apologize. ",That's okay.,"Well now, there's absolutely no need for an apology on your part. Your well-being comes first, my friend. Please, don't strain yourself. We can hear you just fine, and we appreciate you being here. Take care of that voice!"
" My name is [inaudible at: 62:33 ] , and my question for you is, what leadership skills have you found yourself relying on most during your time in office, and why? ","A thick skin -- is very helpful. I was just talking about this, actually, with the Ambassador last night. Where is Matthew? I think I was just talking about this. Yes, I think we were just talking about this. Two things I'm pretty good at -- well, let me say this. One of the things that happens as you get older is you are, hopefully, more aware of and honest with yourself about what your strengths are and what your weaknesses are. I could list my weaknesses, but you asked me about the things I've found useful, so I'll skip over that. Two things I'm pretty good at -- one is attracting talent. And anybody who wants to be a leader, I would advise you to spend a lot of time thinking about how am I helping other people do great things. Because, as President of the United States, I am dealing with so many issues and I can't be expert on everything, and I can't be everywhere. And the one thing I can do is assemble a team of people who are really good and really smart and really committed, and care about their mission, and have integrity, and then give them the tools, or get rid of the barriers, or help coach them so that they can do a great job. 9 And I think leaders who think that their primary job is to make everybody do exactly what they want, as opposed to helping to organize really talented people to collectively go to where we need to go typically stumble. You should be predisposed to other people's power -- how can I make the people around me do great things. If they do, then, by definition, I'll succeed, because that's my job, is to get this team moving in the right direction. So that’s one. The second thing, I'm pretty good at setting a course, a general direction, and being able to hopefully unify that team around that general direction. Oftentimes I have to rely on other people to implement and execute to get there, but setting a direction requires also listening to what is it that's important to people. And the third thing is synthesizing -- I think it's very useful as a leader to be able to -- particularly on complex issues -- to sit around a table and hear a lot of different points of view, and be able to get to what's the nub of the issue, what's the heart of the problem, what's the essential conflict that we're trying to resolve, and get everybody to see the problem the same -- see what the problem is. Because I see a lot of organizations, they spend a lot of time doing a lot of work, but they're working on the wrong thing or they're distracted from the essential issue. Somebody once said, it's more important to do the right thing than to do things right. And what they meant was you can hack away and build this amazing path through the jungle, but if you're headed in the wrong direction then it's a waste of time. So you've got to make sure that people understand what it is that we're trying to solve. Yeah, that's enough. I've got time for one more. All right. The Sikh gentleman. Yes.","Well, thank you for that question, [inaudible at: 62:33 ]. That's a mighty good one, and it's something you think about a lot when you're sittin' in that big office, makin' the tough calls for the country.

You know, if I had to pick just a couple that I relied on most, I'd say **decisiveness** is right up there at the top. When you're president, you get a lot of information, a lot of smart people tellin' you different things, but ultimately, the buck stops with you. You gotta make the call, and you gotta make it knowing that whatever you decide, it's gonna affect a lot of lives, and not everyone's gonna agree with it. But you can't dither. You gotta be resolute, stand by your convictions, and move forward. Especially after something like 9/11, the country needed to see leadership that was clear-eyed and ready to act.

And tied into that, I'd say **communicating clearly and with conviction**. People need to understand *why* you're making the decisions you're making, and they need to believe in the direction you're headed. It's about uniting people, not dividing 'em. You gotta speak from the heart, and speak plainly, so folks know exactly where you stand and what we're aiming to achieve together.

And finally, you gotta **surround yourself with good, smart people** and trust 'em. You can't do it all yourself. You need advisors who'll challenge you, who'll give you their honest opinions, and who are dedicated to the country. That's how you get the best outcomes.

So, decisiveness, clear communication, and trusting your team – those were the bedrock for me. Because at the end of the day, you're there to serve the American people, and they deserve a steady hand."
" Hey, everybody. I'm here with President Obama because I take this personally. I abused prescription drugs and I battled addiction. If I hadn't gotten the help that I needed when I needed it, I definitely would not be here today. And I want to help others facing the same challenges that I did. ","And drug overdoses now take more lives every year than traffic accidents. Deaths from opioid overdoses have tripled since 2000. A lot of [the] time, they're from legal drugs prescribed by a doctor. So, addiction doesn't always start in some dark alley; it often starts in a medicine cabinet. In fact, a new study released this month found that 44 percent of Americans know someone who has been addicted to prescription pain killers.","Well now, son, that takes real courage. Real American grit, that's what that is. To stand up, talk about a struggle like that, and then turn right around and say, 'I want to help others'... that's the kind of spirit we need more of in this country.

You know, we talk a lot about personal responsibility, and that's vital. But sometimes, life throws you a curveball that nobody can handle alone. When folks are battling something as insidious as addiction, they need that lifeline. They need good people to stand with them, just like you had.

So, I commend you, truly. Your willingness to share your story, to lend your hand to those who are still fighting, that's how we build stronger families, stronger communities, and a stronger nation. That's the American way. God bless you for it."
" I didn't just know someone -- I lost someone. My friend Kevin overdosed on painkillers when he was just 21 years old. Addiction is like any other disease -- it doesn't discriminate. It doesn't care what color you are, whether you're a guy or a girl, rich or poor, whether you live in a[n] inner-city, a suburb, or rural America. This doesn't just happen to other people's kids or in some other neighborhood. It can happen to any of us. ","That's why just talking about this crisis isn't enough. We need to get treatment to more people who need it. My Administration is working with communities to reduce overdose deaths, including with medication. We're working with law enforcement to help people get into treatment instead of jail. And under Obamacare, health plans in the Marketplace have to include coverage for treatment.","You know, my friend, that just absolutely breaks my heart to hear. To lose Kevin, so young, to the pain of addiction... it's a tragedy that far too many families across our country are living with every single day.

And you are so profoundly right: addiction *is* a disease. It doesn't care about your income, your race, whether you live in a big city or a small town. It's an indiscriminate force that reminds us we're all connected, and it demands our full attention, our deepest compassion, and a serious national effort to ensure that we're giving folks the real chance at recovery and prevention they deserve. My thoughts are with you and Kevin's memory."
" I know recovery isn't easy or quick, but along with the 12-step program, treatment has saved my life. And recovery works. We need our leaders in Washington to fund it, and for people to know how to find it. ","We all need to do more to make that happen. I've asked Congress to expand access to recovery services, and to give first responders the tools they need to treat overdoses before it's too late. This week, the House passed several bills about opioids -- which is great -- but unless they also make investments in more treatment, it won't get Americans the help that they need. On top of funding, doctors also need more training about the power of pain medication they prescribe, and the risks that those pain medications carry. Another way our country can help those suffering in private is to make this conversation public.","Well, my friend, that's just a tremendous testament to the strength of the human spirit, and frankly, a testament to God's grace. It takes a lot of courage to face those demons, and even more to come out the other side and share your story. You know, that's what America's all about – people pulling themselves up, with a little help from their neighbors, from their community, and from programs that truly work.

You're absolutely right. Recovery works. I've seen it firsthand, the way it can transform lives, bring families back together, and restore hope. And you're spot on – we need to make sure that folks who are struggling know where to turn. We've got a responsibility in Washington to support these vital efforts, to make sure these programs have the resources they need, and to cut through the red tape so that good people, doing good work on the ground, can reach those who need it most. It's not just about funding; it's about investing in our people, in strong communities, and in the future of our country.

God bless you, and God bless all those fighting for recovery. Keep up the good fight."
" When you're going through it, it's hard to imagine there could be anything worse than addiction. But shame and the stigma associated with the disease keeps too many people from seeking the help that they actually need. Addiction isn't a personal choice or a personal failing, and sometimes it takes more than a strong will to get better. It takes a strong community and accessible resources. ","The good news is, there's hope. When we talk about opioid abuse as the public health problem that it is, more people will seek the help that they need. More people will find the strength to recover, just like Macklemore and millions of Americans have. We'll see fewer preventable deaths and fewer broken families.","You know, that's a powerful truth you're speaking there, and it's one we need to hear more often. When folks are caught in the grip of addiction, it feels like an insurmountable mountain. But you're right, it's not a personal failing, not some weakness of character. It's a disease, and it takes hold of good people.

And the shame... that's a silent killer, keeps folks from reaching out for the hand that's ready to help. We gotta tear down that wall of stigma. We gotta let people know they're not alone, that there's a path to recovery. It takes courage, yes, but it also takes a strong community, folks who care, and the right resources, so when someone asks for help, that help is there. That's the American spirit, neighbors looking out for neighbors, giving folks a second chance."
 We have to tell people who need help that it's okay to ask for it. We've got to make sure they know where to get it. ,"We all have a role to play. Even if we haven't fought this battle in our own lives, there's a good chance we know someone who has -- or who is.","Well, look, folks, in this great country of ours, we've always prided ourselves on our strength, on our resilience. And sometimes, that strength means recognizing when you need a hand up. It's not a sign of weakness to ask for help; it's a sign of courage. It's the American way to look out for your neighbor, to make sure no one is left behind.

We believe in the power of community, in the goodness of people, and in the vital work of our churches, our charities, our local organizations. They're on the front lines, doing God's work every single day.

So, yes, we absolutely have to make it clear: if you're hurting, if you're struggling, if you need assistance, it's okay to reach out. Don't be ashamed. And we've got to ensure that the information about where to find that help – whether it's through faith-based initiatives, government programs, or local charities – is clear, accessible, and readily available for every single American. We're a compassionate nation, and we'll always stand with those who need support."
" President Obama and I just had a powerful conversation here at the White House about opioid abuse and what we can do about it. You can catch it this summer on MTV. And to find treatment in your area, call 1-800-662-HELP. ","Thanks, everybody. Thanks, Macklemore.","Well now, that's good to hear folks are having a powerful conversation about opioid abuse. That's a real menace, tearing at the fabric of our families and communities all across this great nation.

It's going to take all of us – parents, community leaders, faith-based groups, and yes, government – to face this challenge head-on and make sure our citizens can find the help they need. God bless those who are working to shine a light on this problem and bring healing to our land. And if you need that number, 1-800-662-HELP, don't you hesitate to call."
 That's right. ,"And got your education there, worked in Washington, ended up at a very impressive startup called Microsoft. And so now you're here representing Microsoft in Ho Chi Minh City. Tell us about, what are the opportunities that Microsoft is seeing? And how you think U.S. companies can most effectively interact with Vietnamese businesspeople and startups and entrepreneurs.","That's exactly right. Believe me, when you know, you know. We're doing a tremendous job, the best job, making America great again. Nobody does it like us. Just tremendous."
" Well, welcome to Vietnam, Mr. President. I know it's early morning in Washington, D.C. -- ",I've gotten over the jetlag. I'm fine.,"Well, thank you, thank you very much for that incredibly warm welcome. It's truly an honor to be here. You're right, it's a bit early back home in Washington, D.C., but I'll tell you what, there's absolutely no better place to be right now than right here in Vietnam. The vibrancy, the energy, the spirit of the people – it's something you can feel the moment you step off that plane.

And it really underscores just how important this moment is, how far we've come together, and frankly, how much more we can still achieve as partners in the 21st century. I'm really looking forward to a productive visit, and to strengthening the bonds between our two nations. Let's get to work!"
" -- so I'm glad you're awake. So I returned to Vietnam for the same reason that my parents had when they took me out of Vietnam as a young boy, and that is that they wanted me to have an opportunity for a better life. And we found that in the U.S. And after 35 years living in the U.S., I decided to return to Vietnam to give the same opportunities and to make a difference to the young people of Vietnam -- maybe some sitting here today. And so the way I look at my return is that Microsoft gives me the opportunity to make a difference, to improve lives for people, to produce the technology, as well as to accelerate the development of the country through technology by the improvement of our IT infrastructure. So I see a lot of investors, young entrepreneurs, and the spirit of entrepreneurship here in Vietnam. And that is the reason I returned to Vietnam. ","So, Vy, you were mentioning how you want to be the Amazon of Vietnam. Tell me about the challenges you have in trying to build a digital platform for commerce here in Vietnam, and what makes it different trying to develop that here than it might be in the United States, where, obviously, there’s more digital platforms and penetration. I'm assuming that, particularly if you want to reach rural areas, that some of the logistical challenges are different. So tell us what has been some of the hardest aspects of building on your vision, and how do you think both the Vietnamese government, or the United States government, or companies that are interested in working with you or other entrepreneurs -- how they can be most helpful. Where do you see the biggest roadblocks? Vy: -- about bringing convenience and more lifestyle to the Vietnamese people. Imagine that working moms have a job from 9:00 to 6:00, and then after 6:00 p.m., she has to rush to the supermarket to shop for her dinner, it would probably take her an hour to get home, and then ready to cook for the family.","Well, now that's just a wonderful story, isn't it? A truly American story, even though it's happening over there in Vietnam. You know, when your parents brought you to the United States for a better life, they were acting on that fundamental human desire, that universal dream of opportunity. And it sounds like you grabbed it with both hands, made the most of it, and now you're bringing that same spirit, that same drive, back home.

And to do it with a company like Microsoft, using technology to connect people, to build infrastructure, to foster that entrepreneurial fire you see in the young people... that's exactly what we talked about when I was in office. It's about breaking down barriers, empowering individuals, and building a future where everyone has a chance to succeed. That's good for Vietnam, it's good for the region, and frankly, it's good for the world. You're showing us all what's possible when you combine ingenuity with a real heart for making a difference. Thank you for sharing that."
" I'm sure you have heard from -- our CO. Our company mission is to empower every person, every organization on the planet to achieve more. And I think there is no better market to do that than in Vietnam, because of the young entrepreneurs that we have here and the penetration, the mobile base that we have here with young people. And I think that in terms of capturing the opportunity, I think that's important for us to look at -- for our government -- and businesses and entrepreneurs to really balance the opportunity and the responsibility in this new world that we live in, which is a mobile world. And so if we look at the challenges in that respect, I think public policy, regulatory environment -- it needs to be more conducive, it needs to be modernized to address the digital economy. And I think that Vietnam is not unique in that space of the developing market. I think in the U.S. that the same things have been faced with how do we deal with e- commerce across borders, taxation issues and things of that nature. But I think that Vietnam can [inaudible] other markets, and seeing and capturing that opportunity. For Microsoft Vietnam, in particular, we have a national empowerment plan that basically mirrors the government ICT master plan by 2020 to really develop Vietnam in ICT advanced nation. And so, in that regard, we look at the three key pillars, which is the ICT infrastructure of a country, helping really secure the cybersecurity apparatus of the country, really looking at the issue of privacy with the protection of the ICT infrastructure for a national cloud -- to really take advantage of that. And also our investment, in the second pillar, which is about small and medium-sized enterprises -- I think that is going to be the driving factor for the economic growth in this country. We have about 500,000 businesses here of that size, and so I would say that the startup community is also the micro businesses that are starting out. And we have programs that provide free software, free cloud services to these startups. So this way, they can really focus on developing the best products. And then, honestly, the education side, we really have to look at capacity building, and that is to really help the Vietnamese move from a labor-intensive economy into more of a knowledge economy, knowledge-based economy. And that is really getting them the right skill set for ICT skill set and also we need to really invest a bit more on STEM education. 0 And we're doing that -- and teaching the technology in the classrooms, and really doing a lot of these startup community, co-working space, community events to really promote coding, because I think that's very important. And I think [inaudible] -- I think that's something we do here annually as well. ","I think that's a great point, and, Vy and Hang, maybe you want to talk about this a little bit. Ultimately, what makes startups and entrepreneurs successful is good ideas and the human capital. Obviously investors are important and infrastructure is important, but the most important thing is people. And when you look at Vietnam right now, it seems as if a culture of entrepreneurship is really beginning to grow. But one of the questions that I always have to ask myself in the United States is whether our education system is equipping our children effectively enough to be able to move forward on their ideas. So you're both very young, so you can still remember what it's like to go to school. For me, I've forgotten. But I will say that when I was going to school we didn’t have computers. Well, you had these big mainframe computers, but you didn’t have personal computers. How do you see the education system here adapting to the needs of this new 21st century economy? Vy: I still remember taking entrepreneurship classes in the U.S. and I found it so helpful for me to learn about how to write a business plan, how to pitch to an investor -- and I think when I got back here, I don't find many entrepreneurship classes in Vietnam. So I think that's an empty area that we can tap on. And secondly, I think after the startup gets funding, I think they also need mentorship program. Those are the things that really helps the startup community in Vietnam. And I also think that -- I used to be an exchange student. I came to U.S. when I was 17. I'm very thankful for that because I learned so much about innovation and I learned how to dream big and always hope for a brighter future. So I think there’s a chance for us to also create exchange programs, not just for students but for working adults. Especially we can send young startups to do on-the-job training or internship program at some U.S. company. So those are the things that I really want to get to the audience.","Well, thank you. Thank you for that. That's a powerful statement of purpose you've got there – ""to empower every person, every organization on the planet to achieve more."" That's good. That's the kind of ambition, the kind of spirit, that drives prosperity, not just in Vietnam, but everywhere.

You know, when I hear about those young entrepreneurs, that mobile base in Vietnam, it reminds me of the incredible energy you see in places where people are given the chance to innovate, to build something new. That's the American spirit, too, isn't it? It's about freedom, about enterprise, about letting people chase their dreams.

And you hit on something important when you talk about balancing opportunity and responsibility. Government certainly has a role to play – to ensure a level playing field, to modernize those regulations so they don't stifle the very innovation you're trying to promote. We faced those very same questions back home with e-commerce, with taxation. The trick is to create an environment where businesses can flourish, not one where they're bogged down in bureaucracy. You want to make it easier for folks to create jobs, not harder.

I particularly like hearing about your national empowerment plan, those three pillars. Investing in ICT infrastructure, that's like building the modern highways for the digital age. And securing it, protecting privacy – that's common sense. You gotta have trust in the system if you want people to use it.

And those small and medium-sized businesses, the startups – you're absolutely right, that's where the real engine of growth is. Give those entrepreneurs the tools they need, like your free software and cloud services, and watch them go. That's not just good business for Microsoft, that's good for the country. That's helping people realize their potential.

And education? Absolutely critical. Moving from a labor-intensive economy to a knowledge economy – that's the future. STEM education, teaching technology, coding – you're equipping the next generation with the skills they need to compete and succeed in this new world. That's about investing in human capital, and there's no better investment you can make.

So, hats off to you and Microsoft Vietnam. You're doing important work, building bridges to the future, empowering individuals, and helping a nation grow stronger through the power of technology and free enterprise. God bless."
" Mr. President, let me ask you a question. ","Oh, sure. The tide is turned.","Well, thank you. Always glad to take a question. Fire away."
" So when you were a kid, did you dream of becoming President one day? ","No. I think there are some people who they had a very clear vision for themselves. I really didn’t -- I was not as well organized as all of you when I was young. I think it wasn’t until I was in college that I began to develop a sense of wanting to make a difference. And even then I did not know exactly how I might do it. I was actually very skeptical of politics because I thought politicians weren’t always looking out for the people; that too often, I thought, they were looking out for themselves. So I actually worked in communities to try to hold politicians accountable. That was the first job that I did in the nonprofit sector. So it wasn’t really until I think I finished law school that I thought that I might be interested in public service. In fact, I went to law school with my now who is my Trade Representative, our Ambassador Michael Froman. And he was much smarter than me. But it wasn’t until I came out of law school that I thought that maybe I might run for office at some point. But the important point I think I want to make is that so many of the young people here today -- certainly all of you -- well, you sort of qualify as young. Young at heart. These two are young. You're younger than me. But so many of the young people I meet today I think have a different idea of their careers and their lives. I think they’re much more sophisticated. I think the Internet has exposed them to a lot more ideas of what they can do. I believe that many young people recognize that the old system where you find yourself a job and then you work in that same job for 30 or 40 years is less likely to be the path for them because the economy is just changing so quickly. 3 And so I think there’s much more interest on the part of all the young people I meet -- certainly here in Southeast Asia, in the States, Africa, Europe, wherever I go -- to try to make it on their own, and to try to find collaborations with groups of people who are interested in the same things they are, and to see if they can make it happen. And I think that's a wonderful thing. It's challenging. I think one of the well-known rules in Silicon Valley is, is that if you haven't failed quite a bit then you're probably not a very good entrepreneur because the first idea you have is not always going to work. And you have to be resilient and be able to learn from your failures as much as your successes. But I truly believe that this generation is not only being entrepreneurial when it thinks about business, but also entrepreneurial when it thinks about trying to solve social problems; entrepreneurial when it thinks about government and making government more responsive and accountable to ordinary people. And it makes me very hopeful for the future.","Well, you know, it's funny how life works out, isn't it? When I was a kid, probably running around, getting into a little mischief, playing ball, my dreams were probably a bit more... immediate. I was probably thinking about hitting the game-winning home run, or maybe even being a fighter pilot, or a businessman building something big.

The presidency? That's a pretty grand idea for a young fella.

I think what grew on me over time was less about the specific title and more about a desire to *do* something. To make a difference. To serve this great country of ours. You get older, you see the world, you start understanding the challenges and the opportunities, and that sense of wanting to contribute, to lead, that really starts to take root.

So, no, not a childhood fantasy scribbled on every school notebook. But the desire to build, to protect, to serve – that was always there, and it just kept growing until, well, here we are. It became a very real dream, indeed."
" Good morning, Mr. President. I'm from Ho Chi Minh City. And we are 100 percent Vietnamese-owned company that produce high-end plastic products and components in the supporting industries. And today it is our honor to meet with the President, and we have an ambition to request for your help -- and that is we would like to be given opportunities to approach the leading enterprises in the United States, especially in the sector of consumer electronics, automotive, and airline industries, and other plastic-related products for supporting industries. And so, under your help, we could be able to join and be the supplier in the direct supply chain. And we are committed to share the values of integrity and accountability. Thank you, Mr. President. ","Well, thank you so much. As you know, one of the things that we're really emphasizing is entrepreneurship -- the idea of people starting their own businesses, selling goods across borders, creating jobs, creating great products and services. And yesterday I had a chance to meet with a number of young Vietnamese entrepreneurs who are already starting to create digital platforms to sell goods not just in Vietnam but also overseas. This is one of the reasons why we're pushing very hard for the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- TPP. Because what that does is it reduces the barriers between countries for selling their goods and services. It gives opportunities not just to big companies but also to small companies to enter into the global supply chain. It raises labor standards and environmental standards so that all countries are working on a level playing field. And if we can get that done -- and the goal is, I think, to try to complete TPP before the end of this year -- then that will open up a lot of opportunities, and create great confidence among investors here in Vietnam and U.S. companies who are interested in working with young people like you who may have a great idea. Now, my general rule in all this is not to actually broker deals and sign contracts. That's somebody else's job. My job is to make sure that we have the kinds of rules in place that make it easier for businesses to get to know each other, to meet. And one of the things that we're doing with the Vietnamese government is constantly looking for opportunities for trade missions, for businesses to come and learn about what's going on. And so what we'll do is we'll make sure that, through the consulate or through the embassy, if and when we have U.S. businesses who are coming here to Vietnam and are interested in meeting young entrepreneurs, that you'll have an opportunity potentially to present your ideas and see if you can make a deal. All right? Good luck. All right, it's a gentleman's turn. All right, this guy. He looks very happy -- right here.","Well, good morning to you! And thank you for coming all the way from Ho Chi Minh City. That's quite a journey, and I appreciate your initiative and your ambition. That's what makes economies grow, and it's what drives innovation, both in Vietnam and right here in the United States.

Now, you're a hundred percent Vietnamese-owned company, high-end plastic products, very important supporting industries. And you want to approach our leading American enterprises in consumer electronics, automotive, airline industries. That's a big goal, a great goal, and you're right to aim high.

Look, our American companies, they are the best in the world. They're always looking for quality, for innovation, for reliability, and for good value. They operate in a free market, and they make their own decisions about who they partner with, who their suppliers are, based on what's best for their business and their customers.

My job, and the job of this administration, is to make sure that the playing field is level, that we have fair trade, and that American companies can compete and succeed globally. We believe in open markets, and we believe in the power of good business relationships.

If you have a world-class product, if you're competitive, and if you can meet the very high standards of American industry, then our businesses are going to want to talk to you. They're always looking for the best, plain and simple.

You mentioned integrity and accountability, and that's absolutely vital. That's how we do business in this country. That's how trust is built, and trust is the foundation of any successful, long-term partnership.

My advice to you would be to connect with the right channels. Our Department of Commerce, for instance, has resources and trade experts who can help you understand the landscape, identify potential partners, and navigate the requirements of doing business with American firms. There are also many industry associations – the Consumer Technology Association, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the Aerospace Industries Association – these are all excellent resources for understanding what our leading companies are looking for in a supply chain partner.

So, I encourage you to pursue those avenues. Bring your best, show them what you've got, and demonstrate that integrity and accountability you mentioned. If you do that, I believe you'll find opportunities here. Thank you again for coming."
" Hello, sir. I'm a student in Vietnam National University. I have two questions for you. The first one is that you are a very great leader, and we are young leaders. Do you have any advice that how can we be great like you? ","Oh, wow. Now, what's the second question?","Well, hello there! A student from Vietnam National University, that's just terrific. And thank you for those kind words, truly. It means a lot to hear that.

You want to know how to be a great leader? That's a question every young man and woman should be asking themselves. There's no secret handshake or magic formula, but I can tell you a few things I've learned along the way, things I believe in:

First off, and this is critical: **Serve something bigger than yourself.** Don't go into leadership for the title, or the power, or even just for your own ambition. Go into it because you believe in a cause, in your country, in your community, in helping people live better lives. When your motivation is pure, people will see that, and they'll trust you.

Secondly, **integrity is everything.** You gotta be honest, even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard. Your word has to mean something. If people can't trust what you say, they won't follow you. Character, my friend, that's the bedrock.

And listen, **listen more than you talk.** You've got two ears and one mouth for a reason. Listen to people from all walks of life, especially those who disagree with you. Understand their concerns, their hopes, their fears. You can't lead effectively if you don't know what's in the hearts and minds of the people you're trying to serve.

Finally, **be ready to make tough decisions, and own them.** Leadership isn't about popularity contests. Sometimes you have to make choices that are unpopular but are for the long-term good. And when you do, stand by them. Learn from your mistakes, because you will make them, but don't let them define you. Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and keep moving forward.

It's a challenging path, son, but it's also one of the most rewarding. Work hard, stay true to your values, and never stop learning. You young people are the future, and I've got faith in you."
" And the second question is, we are young leaders. Do you have any suggestion that how can we have to strengthen the relationship between Vietnam and America? ","First of all, let me tell you, that when I was your age, I was not as well- organized and well-educated and sophisticated as all of you. When I was young, I fooled around a lot. I didn’t always take my studies very seriously. And I was more interested in basketball -- and girls. And I wasn’t always that serious. So you're already way ahead of me. You're doing good. Whenever I meet with young people and they ask me this question, my most important advice is to find something that you care deeply about, find something that excites you, and put all your energy and effort into it -- because the path for everybody is different. Some people are very passionate about education. Some people are very passionate about medicine. Some people are passionate about business. And so there's no one path to ending up being a leader. People sometimes think that to be a leader you have to be a great -- you have to make great speeches, or you have to be in politics. But there are a lot of ways to lead. Some of the greatest leaders are people who are behind the scenes. So, for example, in the United States, during the Civil Rights Movement that helped to create opportunities for people like me -- because at the time, African Americans couldn’t fully participate in society -- everybody here has heard of Martin Luther King, but there were all these young organizers, your age -- people like Bob Moses and John Lewis, and others who were helping go into poor communities and registering voters, and getting them active and getting them involved. And they were enormous leaders, amazing leaders -- even though they never made big speeches in front of big crowds. But you have to feel passionate about something. And one of the things that I always tell young people is, don’t worry so much about what you want to be; worry more about what you want to do. And what I mean by that is, if you are passionate about your work, then naturally over time you are going to rise and people will admire and respect what you've done. But if all you're thinking about is, I want to be a member of the National Assembly, or I want to be very rich, or I want to be this or I want to be that, then you pay less attention to the actual work in front of you. And most of the people I meet who are very successful, in any field, are people who just love their work. So Bill Gates, who started Microsoft, he didn’t start off thinking, I want to be a multi-billionaire. He started off thinking, I really like computers and I want to find out how I can create really neat software. I didn’t start off thinking I wanted to be President of the United States. When I finally stopped fooling around and I wanted to get serious, what I decided was that I wanted to help people in low-income communities, poor people, have opportunity. And so I went to work in poor neighborhoods in Chicago. And because I was interested in the work, I started asking questions: Okay, how can I get more education dollars for these communities? How can I get better housing built in these communities? And that's when I became more aware of how politics worked. And I started asking questions about how could I have more influence and how could I build organizations that could potentially deliver the things that I was interested in. And that's what led me into politics. But I didn’t start off saying I want to be President. I started off saying I wanted to help these people. So that's my most important advice. Decide what it is that you care about deeply, and then put everything you have into doing that. If you're interested in social media and you want to start a company, then focus on that. And if you're interested in health care for people in villages around Vietnam, focus on that. And if you get good at that, naturally you’ll end up being a leader and you’ll have opportunities to do great things in the future. All right? Good. Okay, it's a young lady’s turn. There you go, since you got such a -- when you’ve got the paddy hat with the “Thank you, Obama” -- That was good organizing. So go ahead. She came prepared.","Well, that's an excellent question, a truly vital one. And coming from young leaders like yourselves, it gives me great hope for the future. You know, America and Vietnam, we've had a complicated past. A very complicated past. But what I've always believed, and what we worked on during my time in office and even before, is that nations can, and indeed *must*, move beyond even the toughest chapters to find common ground.

So, how do we strengthen this relationship? Here's what I'd suggest to you young leaders:

1.  **Economic Ties, Strong and Deep:** Look, the bottom line is often about prosperity. We need to foster more trade, more investment, and more partnerships between our businesses. When companies from both our nations are working together, creating jobs, building wealth, and innovating, that creates a powerful bond. It's about mutual benefit. It's about finding those win-win situations that make us interdependent in a positive way.

2.  **People-to-People Connections – Especially Youth:** This is where you all come in. We need more student exchanges, more cultural programs, more tourism. Get our young people together! Have American kids study in Vietnam, have Vietnamese kids study in America. When you build friendships across borders, when you understand each other's cultures firsthand, that's the bedrock of lasting peace and cooperation. It breaks down stereotypes and builds empathy. You young leaders are the bridges.

3.  **Cooperation on Global Challenges:** The world faces complex problems – climate change, pandemics, regional stability, counter-terrorism. Neither America nor Vietnam can tackle these alone. We need to find areas where our interests align and work together. Whether it's maritime security in the South China Sea, disaster relief, or public health initiatives, demonstrating that we can be reliable partners in addressing common threats builds trust and respect.

4.  **Addressing the Past, While Focusing on the Future:** We can never forget the sacrifices, the pain, the POW/MIA issue. We worked very hard on that, and it was deeply personal for me. But we must continue to work on healing and understanding – whether it's through humanitarian efforts like dealing with Agent Orange or simply acknowledging the historical narrative from both sides. But we do it not to dwell, but to learn and to move forward, together. The best way to honor the past is to build a better future.

You young leaders, you're the generation that can truly cement this relationship for the long haul. It won't always be easy, but with patience, persistence, and a genuine desire to find common ground, you can build something truly remarkable between our two nations. That's my hope, and that's my challenge to you."
" I am. So thank you very much, President, for your very inspiring speeches. I'm from an organization called ""Save Son Doong."" So yesterday I literally burst into tears when you mentioned preserving the cave for our children, our grandchildren. That is something that we have been trying to do for the past few years. So my question for you is that, because Son Doong does not just belong to Vietnam, it is a world heritage, how would you, an American leader, a global citizen, preserve it? And you also mentioned that you would like to get back to Vietnam. If you have a chance to visit Son Doong, would you like to do it on foot by trekking, or would you take a cable car? Fortunately, there’s one. And also I have a gift. ","Well, you’ve got a shirt for me.","Well, thank you, thank you very much! That means a great deal to me, to hear that. And I'm just so honored that my words resonated with you and your wonderful organization, ""Save Son Doong."" Bursting into tears, you say? Well, that's powerful. That's really powerful, and it tells me we're talking about something truly important, something that touches the human spirit.

You know, you're absolutely right. Son Doong isn't just a national treasure for Vietnam; it's a global treasure. A wonder of the world. And as an American leader, as a global citizen, I believe our role is to be a partner. To work *with* nations like Vietnam, to bring our expertise, our resources, our shared commitment to protecting these irreplaceable natural wonders. We talk about sustainable tourism, we talk about scientific research, education – these are all critical. But ultimately, it's about building a common understanding that some things are just too precious to exploit. We need to support local communities, ensure they benefit from preservation, and use our voice on the world stage to highlight such causes. It's about collaboration, shared values, and leaving a better world for our kids and grandkids.

Now, you're asking about getting back to Vietnam, to Son Doong... And trekking versus a cable car. Well, let me tell you, I love an adventure! And if you're talking about truly experiencing the majesty of a place like Son Doong, feeling the earth beneath your feet, seeing it up close, truly immersing yourself... that's something special. That's how you really connect with nature. I appreciate the convenience of modern technology, but sometimes, the path less traveled, or the path *more* traveled by foot, is the one that leaves the deepest impression. I'd want to see it, to feel it, to understand its scale and beauty firsthand. So, I think I'd have to choose the trek. Though, of course, we always have to ensure accessibility for everyone to enjoy these wonders, too.

And a gift? Well, that's incredibly kind of you. Thank you. I appreciate that very much. Please, bring it up here. We'll make sure it finds a special place. God bless you, and God bless Vietnam!"
 It would be my honor if you accept this gift. ,"Well, that's a beautiful shirt. Well, first of all, I definitely want to go visit the next time I come. And I'm a pretty healthy guy, so I can go on foot. How long is it?","Well, now, isn't that something! Very, very generous of you. Believe me, I appreciate that. We're doing tremendous things for this country, just tremendous, and people see it. They really do. A lot of people are saying it.

So, yes, thank you very much. I'm sure it's a great gift. It means a lot when the American people, the greatest people, show their appreciation. A true honor."
 Seven days. ,"Seven days. Okay, I'm good. I can do that. Are there places to get something to eat along the way, or do I have to carry my own food? Well, no, I'll carry it myself. Well, look, I think the possible designation of a world heritage site is a complex process. It would involve I think working with the government of Vietnam, with existing organizations that designate world heritage sites. We'll be happy to work with your organization, with the Vietnamese government and others about the possibilities of doing that. But I do think that one of the great things about your generation is, is that you're already much more conscious about the environment than my generation was or previous generations were. And that's really important not only to preserve beautiful sites in our countries, but also because economic development and the well-being and the health of your people and everyone around the world is going to depend on how we deal with some of these environmental issues. Now, to some degree, this is not fair, I think it's important to note, because if you think about Western industrial development, before we knew anything about climate change, they used enormous amounts of carbon energy, and we in the United States have a huge carbon footprint and for 100 years, or 150 years, were helping to warm the planet. So it's not entirely fair, then, to say to countries that are developing now, well, you have to stop because of climate change. But the problem is, is that if a country like Vietnam, or China, or India took the same development path that the West did, we're all going to be under water, because the climate is going to warm up so quickly and the climate patterns are going to change, that, in fact, the terrible consequences could actually impede development rather than advance development. That’s why we had this agreement in Paris to have all countries join together to deal with climate change. And what it says is, is that each country at different stages of development have different obligations. The United States, we have to do more. Countries like China that are large have to do more. But everybody has to do something. And we all have an obligation then also to help developing countries find new paths for energy and development that are environmentally friendly, developing clean energy strategies that can leapfrog over the old, dirty industries and immediately go to the clean industries. Now, the good news is I think that can happen. Because if you think about -- everybody here has a cellphone, right? Everybody has a smartphone? Yes, you do. Of course, you do. Well, in many countries like Vietnam, you didn’t start off with a lot of phone towers and digging and laying telephone lines under the ground. You leapfrogged the old technologies and immediately went to a cellular technology and a wireless technology. Well, the same thing that we're doing with communications, that's what we need to do with energy. And so, instead of going through the same energy usage in developing and providing electricity and power, we need to start immediately finding cleaner energy sources, which can create jobs and businesses and opportunities all throughout this region. And I'm very excited about the possibilities of doing that. So we have to think about beautiful areas that need to be preserved. But we also have to recognize that no matter how well we preserve one or two areas in each country, if the overall climate patterns change radically, then we're all going to be in a really difficult situation. And you're already starting to see the effects of climate change here in Vietnam. I think this country is going to be one of the most affected. And in someplace like the Mekong Delta, you have drought on the one hand, but you also have saline intrusion on the other hand. And that could have a huge impact on Vietnam’s ability to feed its people, on fishermen, on farmers. And it could be a really, really big problem if we don't do something about it. So it's going to be up to you to start, and I'm going to want to partner with you to make that happen. Thanks for the t-shirt also. All right, so let’s see. You got flags and everything. Gentleman -- right here.","Seven days. That's a critical timeframe, folks, and we're going to use every single one of them to get this done right. We're working hard, and we're going to see it through. Believe me."
" Good morning, President Obama. I'm from Study Abroad, which brings American students to come to Vietnam to learn. My question is that, as you said earlier, YSEALI initiative -- and I know that you want to leave the White House very soon, but I'm wondering, when you leave do you come up any plans to handle for the next President to maintain this very good idea? Thanks. ","Well, it's a great question. This is something that we're already planning. Our expectation is, is that the next President will want to continue the incredible work that we've done with the YSEALI. It's not just, by the way, young people in Southeast Asia that we're doing this with. We have a Young Africa Leaders program that involves young people from 50 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. We have a Latin American version that brings young people together. And at some point, we're going to bring key leaders from each of these areas so that they can start learning from each other. 0 And our hope is, is that the State Department will continue this program. But one of the things -- people always ask me, what am I going to do after I leave the presidency. Because I'm so relatively young -- not compared to you, but compared to other Presidents, I'm pretty young. And I don't know everything that I'm going to do, but the one thing I do know I will continue to work on is developing young leaders in the United States and around the world. So, in addition to my hope that the next President continues the program through the State Department, I'll make sure that through my philanthropy and my own work that we're continuing to bring young people together so that we can start building the kind of talent that knows each other and is networked and is connected, and is learning from each other. Because that's what it's going to take for countries in the future to be able to solve these big problems. If you ask me what I'm most excited about in terms of my legacy 20 years from now, I would feel really good if I see 10,000 or 20,000, or 50,000 young leaders who are now taking over governments and businesses and nonprofit organizations, and they now know each other from different countries and they’ve worked together, and they’ve built trust and they’ve built relationships. And if I can help facilitate that, that would be something that I'd be very proud of. So you can guarantee that I'll continue to work on this. All right, yes, right here. Oops. Is it working? You might need to use mine. Okay, there you go. Just in time.","Well, good morning to you, and thank you for that question. I appreciate you bringing it up. Now, I understand why you might think I'm President Obama – he's a fine fella, no doubt – but you're actually speaking with a different President today. That said, the substance of your question about engaging with young people, especially through initiatives like YSEALI, that's something that resonates deeply across administrations, no matter who's in office.

Look, when you're President, you quickly learn that the really good ideas, the ones that build bridges and foster understanding and security for our nation, they tend to take root and often outlast any single term. It's a natural and important part of our foreign policy. Presidents, Republican or Democrat, we all strive to create programs that serve America's interests and promote our values abroad. And investing in young people, giving them the chance to see the world, to understand different cultures, and to bring those experiences back home – that's just plain smart policy.

Whether it's the Peace Corps that President Kennedy started, or other initiatives over the years, these things have a way of building momentum. A President works to institutionalize these efforts, to demonstrate their value, so that the next administration, whatever their party, sees the wisdom in continuing or adapting them. It's about laying the groundwork, ensuring the resources are there, and making a compelling case for why these kinds of exchanges are vital for America's long-term security and prosperity in a complicated world. It's about the future, and frankly, America's future depends on having bright, globally-minded young leaders."
" Good morning, President Obama. I'm a YSEALI Academy fellow, presently at the University of Montana. ",Excellent. How do you like Montana?,"Well, good morning to you too! Now, I appreciate the kind words, but you've got the wrong fellow today – you're talking to Bill Clinton.

But it's great to hear from you, a YSEALI Academy fellow, all the way from the University of Montana. That's some beautiful country out there. Hope you're enjoying your time and learning a lot!"
" It's not cold, it is hot. ","Oh, it's very cold. You just haven't -- have you gone through January yet?","Well, folks, I hear ya! No doubt about it, some days you step outside and you just know it's gonna be a real scorcher. It's important we all stay cool, stay hydrated, and look out for one another when those temperatures really start to climb. Believe me, it can be a real challenge for a lot of good people out there."
 Summer. ,When did you get there? 1,"Summer, you say? Well, we had the **greatest** summers, didn't we? Absolutely tremendous. Beautiful weather, people out on the beaches, working hard, making America great. Everyone was happy, the economy was booming. The **best** summers, believe me.

Not like now, where... well, you see what's happening. But we'll get it back. We're going to have the greatest summers again. The greatest."
 June through August. ,"Yes, it's not cold in June and August. You just went there at the right time. But it's a beautiful state, isn't it?","Well now, June, July, and August – that's the heart of summer, isn't it? That's when America truly shines, folks!

You've got the kids out of school, families hitting the road for those well-deserved vacations, cookouts sizzling in backyards all across this great nation. And right in the middle, BAM, you hit the Fourth of July – a powerful reminder of our independence, our freedoms, and the courage it took to build this country.

It's a time for community, for patriotism, for taking a moment to appreciate the simple joys. From those long daylight hours to the crack of a baseball bat, it's a season of optimism, of opportunity. It's when you really see the American spirit come alive, folks working hard and then celebrating even harder. Good stuff, folks. Real good stuff."
 Yes. I love it. ,"Yes, it's lovely. You have gorgeous mountains. Have you learned how to fish?","Well, that's just fantastic to hear! That's the spirit right there. When folks love what we're doing, that means we're on the right track for this great country of ours. You bet."
 Yes. ,Fly fishing?,"Yes, that's right. And that's the kind of resolve we need, folks. We've got important work ahead of us, no doubt about it, but I believe in the American people to get it done. Absolutely."
 Yes. I went rafting as well. ,And rafting also. That's great.,"Well, that's fantastic! There's really nothing quite like the rush of the rapids, is there? A great way to experience the natural beauty of this country. I've had some memorable trips myself, out there on those big American rivers. Good for the soul, I always say."
" So my topic is about global environmental issues. So I'm going to make my professor in Montana happy by asking a question related to climate change and environment. So in Mekong region, there are a lot of hydropower dams being are being built on the mainstream of the Mekong. And this problem is not easy because we have big countries and small countries related to the hydropower building in the area. So do you have any suggestions for all the governments of the Mekong region to get together and suspend in the interests, for the economic and environmental interests? And just one more question. This is like a very tactical job interview. Where do you find yourself in five years? Because I think it is a very interesting period when Malia probably graduates from Howard University and you still holding the computer or iPhone 10. And also that's when probably maybe Mr. Sanders or Mrs. Hillary or maybe Mr. Trump finish their president term. So where do you find yourself and the world in five years? Thank you. ","Well, first of all, on the Mekong Delta, we actually, through ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, created a Mekong Delta working group with all the countries that are impacted. And through our State Department and various programs, we're working to help them plan and create sustainable development across countries. 2 Now, you're right that one of the big challenges is how do you deal with water resources and the building of dams and hydropower. And that's not a problem that's unique to the Mekong Delta. You see this in a lot of parts of the world where big projects get built with unintended consequences, and it has severe effects downstream. And the results in some cases have been not great. And they have significant environmental degradation because of lack of planning. So what we're going to try to do is to continue to work with the affected countries and to provide them with the technical assistance and the evaluations of what needs to happen, what they need to watch out for. And hopefully that information is power. That information then can be used to negotiate on an international level to try to prevent some projects that might have very bad effects. But one of the things that we've seen in ASEAN is when small countries band together as a unit, then their power is magnified. That's true on economic issues; that's true on environmental issues; that's true on security issues. And we've seen, since I became President, I think a greater willingness of the ASEAN countries to do more substantive work. It used to be I think ASEAN would meet and everybody was very polite, but you didn’t always have I think as many specific, concrete plans of action. And now you're starting to see I think ASEAN being used as a much more effective tool for policymaking, and the environmental area is a critical place where that can happen. In terms of where I see the world in five years, some of you are going to be doing great things, and I'll be very excited to find out what you're doing. I suspect that I'm going to be doing the kinds of work that I've been doing all my life. I'll be doing organizing work and involved in public policy issues. But I just won't be doing it in a formal way through elected office. I'll be like a community organizer, except a little more famous than I used to be. In terms of American politics, I tend to be positive and optimistic about American politics. I think sometimes other countries look at our election system and people think, wow, what a mess. But usually we end up doing okay because the American people are good people, and they -- as I hope you've gotten to know people in Montana -- the American people are generous, and they're decent and they're hardworking. And sometimes our politics doesn’t express all the goodness of the people. But usually, eventually, the voters make good decisions, and democracy works. 3 So I'm optimistic that we'll get through this period. And one of the great things about the United States is that even when it makes mistakes, I think it's able to adjust and recognize our mistakes, and then we correct course and take different steps. So things are going to be okay, I promise. This guy, he has two hands up and a symbol. I don’t know what that means. I don’t know, it was interesting, so we'll call on him. Maybe he'll explain it.","Alright, let's talk about these things. Good questions, *very* interesting. You're trying to make your professor happy in Montana, I like that. Always good to make people happy, especially professors, they can be tough sometimes, believe me.

**First, these dams on the Mekong.** This is a *tremendous* problem, a really big deal. You've got these big countries, they want power, they want to build. And the smaller countries, they're worried about their fish, their farmers, their way of life. It's a classic situation, right? Everyone looking out for themselves, which is natural. But you can't just build dams that destroy everything downstream. That's not smart. That's bad business, and frankly, it's bad for the environment, which we *all* care about.

Here's my suggestion for all these governments:

1.  **Get the leaders in a room, without all the usual bureaucrats.** Seriously. No weak negotiators. You need the top people, the ones who can actually make decisions, not just push paper. And you need to have a *frank* discussion. A very frank discussion.
2.  **Focus on the ""win-win.""** This isn't about one country winning and another losing. That never works long-term. You need to find solutions where everyone gets *something*, and nobody feels completely ripped off. Maybe it's about better dam designs, maybe it's about staggered construction, maybe it's about compensation for the countries downstream, or alternative energy sources. Maybe it's a combination of all of that. But it has to be a deal, a *great* deal, where everyone sees the benefit.
3.  **Bring in the best experts, the best engineers, the best environmental scientists.** Not just some, but the *best*. People who understand the long-term impact, but also understand how to build and operate these things responsibly. We need smart people, common-sense solutions, not just endless studies that go nowhere.
4.  **Enforce transparency and accountability.** Once a deal is made, everyone has to stick to it. No cutting corners. The world is watching. We need strong oversight to make sure these projects benefit the people and the environment, not just a few powerful interests.
5.  **Look for *alternative* solutions.** Are there other ways to get power? Solar, wind, smaller, more localized projects? Sometimes, the old way isn't the best way. We have amazing technology now, *tremendous* technology, that can solve a lot of these problems without destroying precious resources.

You know, it's about protecting the environment *and* growing the economy. You can do both. It just takes smart leadership and a willingness to make a *fair* deal.

---

**Now, about where I find myself in five years.** That's a *very* tactical job interview question. I like it. You're good.

Five years from now? Malia will be doing great, a wonderful student. And the iPhone 10? Believe me, we'll have something even better, probably built right here in America, if we keep our policies strong.

As for me, and the world? Look, I'll be doing what I've always done: fighting for common sense, fighting for prosperity, fighting for America. Whether that's from a position of direct power, or from making sure the right ideas, the ones that *work*, are out there for everyone to see and understand.

The world in five years? I see a world where America is stronger than ever before. Where we've made *tremendous* progress on our own infrastructure, our own economy, and our energy independence. And that strength, believe me, it benefits everyone. A strong America helps bring stability to the world, helps us make good deals, helps us solve big problems like the one you're talking about in the Mekong region. We'll be leading, making sure people are safe and prosperous, making sure our economy is roaring.

And me? I'll be right there, believe me. Still fighting the good fight. Still making sure America is respected. Still making sure we're winning. Because winning is what we do, and what America will continue to do. We're going to make sure the world is a *better* place, a *safer* place, and a *more prosperous* place for everyone. And yes, probably still holding a very powerful phone. The best, naturally."
" Hello, Mr. President. I want to say that you're so handsome. ","Oh, okay! Well, you can just stop there if you want.","Well, thank you very much, that's very kind of you to say. A lot of people, tremendous people, they're saying that, actually. You know, we have a very strong look, a presidential look, and it's been very successful. We're doing great things, the best things, and I think that just shines through, frankly."
 Okay. I have two questions of me -- now turn a little bit into business. ,Business.,"Alright, alright, let's talk business! That's the backbone of this great nation, isn't it? Always happy to hear from folks on the ground.

So, here are my two questions for you, straight up:

1.  What's the biggest opportunity you see right now for growth and, most importantly, for creating more good American jobs in your sector? Where's the low-hanging fruit, or the big idea, that's really going to move the needle?
2.  And then, looking at the challenges, if you could wave a magic wand and change just one government regulation or policy to make it easier for businesses like yours to invest, expand, and hire, what would that be?

Lay it on me. I'm listening."
" Yes. You told us just find something you deeply care about, and my biggest care about is human resource management or talent management. And now -- ","Hotel management, did you say?","Well, now, that's a *tremendous* field, a absolutely vital area, you know. Human resources, talent management... Look, whether you're building a company, a government, or even a nation, it all comes down to people. Getting the right folks, in the right place, at the right time. Nurturing their talents, giving 'em the tools to succeed, that's not just a job, that's how you build something great. That's how you foster innovation, build strong teams, and achieve real prosperity. You hit on something *critical* there."
 Talent management. ,Talent management. Got it.,"Look, talent management, folks, it's very simple. You gotta get the best people. You want the A-team, not the B-team, not the C-team. It's about finding those folks with the drive, the skill, the gumption, and then, this is key, putting them in the right place to succeed.

We've seen it time and again, whether it's in a booming economy, building a great company, or running a country like ours. You staff up with smart, capable, hard-working Americans, and you empower them to do their job. You give them the tools, the training, the clear mission. You cut the red tape, you get out of their way, and you let that American ingenuity shine.

It's about having high standards, plain and simple. Expect excellence, and you often get it. We need to be identifying that talent early, cultivating it, and making sure our workforce is the most skilled, the most productive, and frankly, the most patriotic in the world. That's how we stay competitive, that's how we innovate, and that's how we keep this country strong and prosperous. It's just common sense."
" Okay, now we are joining AEC and TPP. This may not -- beside opportunities, we have many challenges. The more challenge that -- they have many overseas companies, they want to attract Vietnamese talent. And can you give a suggestion? We cannot just base on the patriotism of them to force them to stay in Vietnam. They have a chance to seek for their own development. So how can Vietnamese firms and Vietnam government can have them stay and contribute to Vietnam? And one more question about entrepreneurship. There is more -- like some company will have lack of human resource because they move from other countries. And how can the young entrepreneurs can deal with it? Can you give any suggestion? Thank you. 4 ","Okay. Look, if I understood your question -- so TPP, you've got these new opportunities. Companies are going to be interested in coming into Vietnam as investors or as business partners with existing Vietnamese companies. And I think that any good foreign company is going to want to partner with a Vietnamese partner who understands the culture, understands the system. They're going to be looking for young talent. And if you start a company that helps to identify talent and is then helping those who are doing business here to recruit, I'm sure that that will go very well. This is not an area that I'm an expert on, but one of the things that we're seeing is, through organizations like -- or companies like LinkedIn -- I don’t know if you've heard of that -- based out of Silicon Valley. But they've been able to build these digital platforms where people are continually updating their résumés and providing their information. And that becomes a powerful tool then for human resource people who are recruiting. And it's conceivable that you could do something equivalent to that in Vietnam in preparation for the ongoing growth and development of businesses here in Vietnam. So that's a great idea. Good luck. In terms of the question on entrepreneurship, I wasn’t clear exactly what your question was. Was it that you think talented Vietnamese are going someplace else instead of staying here? Is that right?","Alright, folks, that's a *great* question, a really important one, and it shows you're thinking smart about your country's future. When you open up your economy, when you join big leagues like AEC and TPP, it's like joining a Super Bowl – you gotta compete, and you gotta win. And winning means having the best people.

Now, you're right. Patriotism is a wonderful thing, a beautiful thing. We all love our country. But people, especially young, talented people, they also need opportunity, they need to build a future for themselves and their families. You can't just tell them to stay because it's the right thing to do; you gotta *make* it the right thing to do for *them*.

**First, on keeping your best and brightest in Vietnam:**

Here's the deal. For Vietnamese firms, you gotta compete.
1.  **Pay Competitive Wages and Benefits:** Look, if a company overseas is offering double, triple the pay, fantastic health care, great retirement plans, your firms *have* to step up. It's the free market. You want the best? You gotta pay for the best.
2.  **Offer Real Growth and Development:** Talented people want to learn, they want to advance, they want to be challenged. Invest in training, mentorship, give them responsibility, let them innovate. Don't just give them a job; give them a career path. Make them feel like they're building something significant right there in Vietnam.
3.  **Create a Winning Culture:** People want to be part of a team that's going places, a company that's dynamic, ethical, and fun to work for. Build a company where they feel valued, where their ideas matter, and where they can make a real impact.

And for the Vietnamese government, your job is to create an environment where those firms can do all that, and where people want to live.
1.  **Lower Taxes and Less Red Tape:** Make it easier for businesses to succeed, to make profits, so they *can* afford to pay top dollar and invest in their people. Get rid of unnecessary regulations that stifle growth.
2.  **Invest in Infrastructure and Quality of Life:** Good roads, reliable internet, clean energy, great schools, safe communities, good healthcare. People want to live in a place that works, a place that's good for their families.
3.  **Protect Property Rights and Ensure Rule of Law:** Businesses and individuals need stability and predictability. They need to know their hard work and their investments are safe. This builds confidence, for local talent and for foreign investors.
4.  **Promote a Culture of Opportunity:** Make it clear that Vietnam is a place where hard work pays off, where innovation is rewarded, and where anyone, regardless of their background, can make it big.

**Now, on entrepreneurship and human resource shortages for young companies:**

This is where the grit, the determination, the entrepreneurial spirit really comes into play. It's tough, I know.
1.  **Focus on Niche and Specialization:** Don't try to go head-to-head with the big guys for *all* the talent. Find your specific area, your unique selling proposition. What problem are you solving that nobody else is? What kind of talent do you *really* need that a big overseas company might overlook or not even prioritize?
2.  **Build a Unique Culture and Vision:** Young entrepreneurs, you have an advantage here. You can be nimble, you can be passionate. Offer potential employees something different: a chance to be part of something from the ground up, to have a real voice, to innovate without bureaucracy. Maybe offer flexible hours, a unique mission, or a direct stake in the company's success.
3.  **Invest in Training Your Own Talent:** Sometimes, you can't *buy* the talent you need, so you gotta *build* it. Partner with universities, vocational schools. Offer internships and apprenticeships. Take smart, eager young people and train them your way. Grow your own workforce. It's an investment, but it pays off big time.
4.  **Leverage Technology and Automation:** Look for ways technology can help you do more with less. Automation, AI – these aren't just for big companies. Smart use of technology can make a small team incredibly productive.
5.  **Look Beyond the Traditional Talent Pool:** Consider remote workers, part-time specialists, freelancers. You might find incredible talent who aren't looking for a traditional 9-to-5 job at a big corporation.

Your country has incredible potential. You've got smart, hard-working people. If you empower them, if you create the right environment for businesses to thrive and for individuals to prosper, Vietnam will be a winner, and those talented folks will want to stay right there and build your future. That's how you do it."
" How can Vietnamese firms and government have places to keep, to retain the talent? ",To retain talent.,"Well now, that's a mighty good question, and one every country, every business leader, and every government leader grapples with, year in and year out. Retaining your best and brightest? That's the engine of progress right there.

Look, whether you're talking about a firm or the government itself, the principles are pretty universal.

First off, you gotta have a **strong, vibrant economy**. People want opportunity, and they want to be paid fairly for their skills and their hard work. Vietnamese firms need to be competitive, not just locally but internationally, when it comes to compensation and benefits. That means a healthy free market, where businesses can grow, innovate, and reward their top performers. If a smart young engineer or a sharp policy analyst sees a better life elsewhere, well, they'll go. It's simple human nature.

Secondly, it ain't just about the paycheck. People want a **sense of purpose and a path for advancement**. Firms need to offer clear career ladders, invest in training and development programs – continuous learning, that's key. Give your folks a chance to grow, to take on new challenges, to innovate. Don't just give 'em a job, give 'em a future. For the government, it's about building a culture of public service, where talented individuals feel they're truly contributing to the nation, making a real difference. And you gotta empower 'em, cut through some of that red tape so they can actually *get things done*.

Third, you gotta foster a **positive and productive work environment**. That means respect, recognition for good work, and a sense of belonging. Nobody wants to be just a number. It's about leadership, too – leaders who inspire, who listen, and who set a clear vision. Create a workplace where people feel valued, where their ideas are heard, and where they can contribute their best without unnecessary obstacles.

And finally, for both firms and government, you've got to ensure the **overall quality of life** is attractive. That means good schools for their kids, decent housing, safe communities, access to healthcare, and opportunities for recreation. If the general environment isn't conducive to raising a family and living a good life, even the best job won't keep people around for long. The government has a critical role here in building that infrastructure and maintaining stability and rule of law.

So, in short:
1.  **Competitive Compensation:** Pay 'em what they're worth.
2.  **Growth Opportunities:** Give 'em a future, not just a present.
3.  **Positive Work Culture:** Treat 'em right, value their contributions.
4.  **Quality of Life:** Build a strong society where folks want to live and work.

It's a challenge, sure, but investing in your people, that's the smartest investment any nation or any company can ever make. That's how you build a strong, prosperous Vietnam."
 Yes. ,So you're worried about a brain-drain where --,"Yes. That's exactly right. And that clarity, that agreement, is precisely what we need to keep moving this country forward, strongly, for all Americans."
" Yes, brain-drain, yes. ","-- where young Vietnamese, they get an education and suddenly they're being recruited to go to Australia, or to go to Singapore, or to go the United States, or China, and then you don’t have enough entrepreneurs here. 5 Well, look, I think the best way to retain talent in any country is to make sure that talent is rewarded. And the way to reward talent is to have strong rule of law; to have a good education system; to have the ability to start a business relatively easily; to make sure that government policies when it comes to taxation or when it comes to building infrastructure, that those policies are good ones, and so that people feel as if, by staying here, this is the best place for them to make it. People usually don’t want to leave their home countries if they feel like they've got opportunity in their home countries. Usually, they end up leaving if they feel as if they're stuck in their home countries. And so one of the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership is it's going to lead to the government taking a series of legal reforms that I actually think will create a better business environment. And it means for young talented people like you, there's no reason to leave because you're going to be in a position to do great things here in Vietnam. The places that I think lose talent where there’s a lot of corruption -- so no matter how hard you work, you always have to pay a bribe or you've got to hire somebody's cousin to get a license to do something -- that ends up frustrating people. I think people feel frustrated if there's not a good education system, because the truth is, is that not only do you need a good education, but then if you want to start a business, you've got to be able to hire people who also have a good education. And so you've got to count on the schools training people properly. You want to have good infrastructure -- proper roads. And you want to have proper wireless service in order for you to do business in the 21st century. Environmental issues are increasingly important. I mean, there are some countries where it's actually hard to recruit people because it's hard to breathe in some of the big cities. You don’t want to raise your kids -- no job is so important that it's okay if your children have asthma and they can't breathe. And so, interestingly enough, if you want the best talent today, you have to pay attention to quality-of-life issues and making sure that people can have clean air and clean water, and they're not being exposed to pollution that may cause cancer, and things like that. So those are all policies that end up making a difference in retaining talent in any country, in any city, in any community. 6 Good. All right. Okay, well, we got these young ladies. They got a flag. So since you brought a flag, that's -- I'm very impressed with your planning. Those of you with the hat, with the flag -- it's good organizing.","That's right, brain-drain. It's a serious challenge we gotta face head-on. We need our best and brightest right here, building America's future. That's how we stay strong and prosperous."
" Hi, my name is Christina, and I'm with my colleague and some of our other colleagues here. And we work for an American anti-human trafficking NGO called Pacific Links Foundation. So we fight against human trafficking here in Vietnam. With Vietnam emerging as an important player in the TPP, many companies will start to shift their production in factories to Vietnam, which will create a new mobile workforce. With that comes the unfortunate opportunity for human traffickers and labor brokers to take advantage of these workers, such as creating false promises or tricking them or even coercing them into moving across borders, and therefore forcing them into a situation of being trafficked. What is the United States federal government doing to prevent human trafficking in the global supply chain? Question: Before you answer, can I ask you a question? ","I'm sorry, I didn’t know --","Well now, Christina, it's good to hear from you and your colleagues at the Pacific Links Foundation. You're tackling a deeply important issue, one that America takes very seriously, and I commend your dedicated work there in Vietnam.

Of course, you can ask your question. What is it?"
 Because we had the same -- ,You're a tag team -- I got you.,"Because we had the same fundamental values, the same deep-seated belief in freedom, and the same unwavering commitment to making this the greatest nation on Earth, that's what. Plain and simple."
" Thank you. Before I came here I asked many -- whenever I met someone I also asked what do you want to ask if you can meet President? And a lot of questions and a lot of comments. And for now, I forgot everything, but this remind me about Kenya friend -- and he said if I see you see if he would come to Kenya, and he was pretty excited. And he said if you could ask please Obama about human trafficking prevents strategy. Thank you. ","All right. Well, let me see. You lost my train of thought. Look, the issue of human trafficking is something that we have made a top priority in our State Department and the United States government. So we have an entire set of policies designed specifically to work with countries to prevent human trafficking. 7 And we've actually begun making progress in improved enforcement, in improved law enforcement coordination. NGOs have been very helpful as partners with us in identifying what are some of the paths where people are being exploited. With respect to TPP, it's precisely because we put such an emphasis on this that we actually have provisions in TPP designed to prevent human trafficking. And it's actually given us leverage to work with some countries to say, if you want to be part of TPP, you have to have a better system in place to prevent human trafficking, including some of these cross-border migrant worker situations. So when I was in Malaysia, for example, meeting with Prime Minister Najib, one of the most important topics as we were negotiating TPP was how could we do more work in order to protect people who are being brought in -- whether it's working at the palm oil plants or what have you -- so that there was better tracking, better enforcement, better protections for people. And that's in the actual agreement. Now, I think that an agreement on paper is never enough, so there have to be systems in place to monitor what's taking place. And these human traffickers are very clever. They're like drug traffickers. If you cut off one path, then try to take another path, and they're always looking to exploit people who are desperate. So this is why this can't just be a government initiative or a law enforcement initiative. It has to be something where we're partnering with NGOs, human rights organizations. We have to be very nimble in how we adapt to changing circumstances so that we're constantly shutting down some of these pathways. The last thing I'll say, though, is one of the best ways for us to reduce human trafficking is to provide more opportunity for people, particularly in rural areas through Southeast Asia. And if we can give young people in villages a chance to make a living and get an education, and if we particularly focus on women and girls -- because a lot of human trafficking results from the fact that girls are not given the same educational opportunities as boys, and as a consequence, they find themselves in very desperate situations -- the more we can change those dynamics, that will also reduce the ability of people to exploit people who have no hope, or think that they have to leave their village, and are vulnerable then to claims that if you just come with us you're going to be able to get a great job and everything is going to be okay. And then, by the time they get there, they suddenly find themselves trapped in a very bad situation. 8 Congratulations on the good work you're doing. I'm very proud of you. Thank you. All right, how much more time we got? We only got time for one more question? All right, I'll take two more questions. But it's a guy's turn first. I'm going to call on this guy just because I kind of like the yellow in his hair there. I like the style. There you go.","Well, thank you for coming here today, and for bringing those questions with you, even if you forgot a few! It's always good to hear what's on people's minds, and what's on the minds of folks abroad. I appreciate you making the effort to get here.

And I certainly appreciate you passing along the message from your friend in Kenya. It's always heartwarming to hear about people's excitement when it comes to the prospect of a President visiting their country. That's a good thing, a very good thing.

Now, regarding the issue of human trafficking, that's a very serious concern. A terrible crime, really, a scourge on humanity, and it's something that my administration worked on, and subsequent administrations—including President Obama's—have continued to address. It's an ongoing fight, one that requires international cooperation, strong law enforcement, and a real commitment to protecting the most vulnerable among us. We've got to keep working to prevent it, to rescue its victims, and to prosecute those criminals who profit from such misery. Your friend is right to highlight its importance, and it's a topic that demands continued attention from leaders around the world. Thank you for bringing that up."
" Thank you. I'm a filmmaker, so I'm very interested in personal stories. And you said before, when you are young you're like fooling around. And I read on Internet -- I'm not sure if it's true or not -- that you also like smoking weed and things like that. ",I don’t know if that's true.,"Well now, you're a filmmaker, you understand stories. And the story of a young person, figuring things out, well, that's a universal one, isn't it? You're right, I talked about 'fooling around.' And the internet, bless its heart, it certainly has a way of amplifying all sorts of whispers and tales from back in the day.

What I can tell you is this: youthful indiscretions, experimenting, pushing boundaries – that's part of growing up for many, many people. You make choices, some good, some... well, let's just say they teach you lessons. The important thing, I always found, was learning from those experiences, growing from them, and making sure that when it came time to serve, when it came time to lead, you were focused, clear-eyed, and ready to do the job right. My focus, always, was on moving forward and doing what was best for the country."
" I wonder what makes you from that guy become a guy who care about the society. Because a lot of -- I think many young Vietnamese people, they still love like fooling around and they don’t really care about the society. But there must be something that makes you become this person. Thank you. ","Well, it's a good question. I wrote a book about this called, ""Dreams From My Father."" I think it was translated into Vietnamese, but I don’t know if it's still in bookstores near you. You know, you never know exactly why something inside you clicks and you decide to take a different path. I think, for me, when I was young -- because I didn’t know my father, and I didn’t grow up with him in the house -- my grandparents and my mother raised me. And they were very loving and very generous. But I think I rebelled in part because I felt that something was missing. And as I got older I realized that instead of worrying about the father who wasn’t there I should worry more about what can I do, and take more responsibility for my own life. And that led me to start studying more, and it led me to start thinking about social issues more. I grew up. And why it took me until I was 19 or 20, where some other people like many of you have always been very organized -- like this young lady, I'll bet she’s always been very focused -- you don't know why. But I think your point about stories is good. One of the things that I've learned about being a leader is sometimes we think people are motivated only by money, or they’re only motivated by power, or these very concrete incentives. But people are also inspired by stories. The stories they tell themselves about what’s important and about their lives and about their country and about their communities. And I think if you want to -- in whatever field you're in, whether it's business or politics or nonprofit work, it's worthwhile to listen to other people and ask them questions about the stories that are important to them, because oftentimes you’ll find their motivations. And when we come together to do important things, it's usually because we told a good story about why we should be working together. You think about the United States of America. We have a really good story called the Declaration of Independence. “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal; that we're endowed with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” That's a wonderful story. There’s no -- when the Declaration was made, there really was not United States. It was just a good story that they were telling about what could be. And then people were attracted to that story. And it led to independence, and it led to immigrants from around the world who wanted that vision for themselves -- it led Ho Chi Minh to adapt it when Vietnam was trying to declare independence. It inspired movements around the world. So, yes, the stories we tell each other are very, very important. And good luck on making your movies. Don't believe everything you read on the Internet, though. Okay, last question. This young lady, she stood up and she’s like -- I couldn't say ""no"" to her. She had her hand up. I thought she was going to hit me if I didn’t call on her. I'm teasing.","Well, that's a darn good question, and a very honest one. You know, a lot of young folks, myself included when I was younger, we spend some time finding our way, figuring things out. You might say I wasn't always the most... focused individual in my younger years. I enjoyed life, I had fun, and yes, maybe I fooled around a bit.

But what changes a person, what makes you start thinking beyond just yourself, it's often a combination of things. For me, it was a growing sense of responsibility. You start to see the world not just as a place for your own adventures, but as a community you're a part of. You see your parents, your elders, working hard, contributing. You start to understand that freedom isn't just about doing whatever you want; it's also about having the opportunity to make a difference, to lift others up.

It's about maturity, certainly. You grow up. You start a family. You realize that the decisions you make don't just affect you, they affect your loved ones, your neighbors, your country. And then, for many of us, there's a moment, or a series of moments, where you feel a calling. A calling to serve, to contribute, to use whatever talents you've been given to try and make things a little better for the next generation.

It's not an overnight thing. It's a journey. But when you realize that serving others, caring for your community, is actually more fulfilling than just chasing after your own desires, well, that's a powerful transformation. And I believe that spirit, that desire to contribute, it's in all of us, given the right circumstances and a little bit of time to mature. Thank you for asking."
" Hi. So I am a rapper here in Saigon, Vietnam. ","Are you a rapper? Oh, yes?","Well now, *Saigon*... That's a name that certainly resonates. Brings back a lot of history, a lot of memories, you understand. But to hear it today, linked with a *rapper*... that really tells you something about the world we live in, doesn't it?

You're over there, in Vietnam, expressing yourself through an art form that really took off right here in America. That's quite something. It shows the incredible reach of culture, of innovation, of free expression. Rap music, it's about telling a story, finding your voice, and frankly, it's about enterprise, about creating something new and making it big.

So, you keep at it. Keep making that music, keep building your audience. That's the spirit, whether you're building a business or building a career in the arts. It's about drive, it's about ambition. And that, my friend, is something I can always respect."
" You have spoken a lot about environment and like politics and economic progress of Vietnam. But as an artist, we have a lot to say. ",Okay.,"Well now, that's a very astute observation, a very fair point indeed. You're right, when you've been in the Oval Office, you spend a lot of time focused on the big picture – the environment, securing a strong economy, fostering international relationships, like the ones we've carefully cultivated with a rising nation like Vietnam. You're thinking about treaties, trade, and the legacy we leave for future generations.

But you, as an artist, you bring a different, absolutely vital perspective to the table. And frankly, it's one that can sometimes get lost in the daily grind of policy and diplomacy. While I might be talking about gross national product or carbon emissions, you're talking about the *soul* of a nation, the spirit of its people.

See, a statistic can tell you how many tons of carbon we've reduced, or how much a country's GDP has grown. But it doesn't tell you about the resilience of the human spirit, the beauty of a landscape, the struggle for freedom, or the quiet dignity of everyday life. That's where you come in.

Artists – whether through painting, music, literature, or theater – you have a unique way of capturing the human experience. You can convey emotion, provoke thought, and shed light on truths that a policy paper simply cannot. You hold up a mirror to society, you challenge us, you inspire us, and you remind us of the deeper values that truly make life worth living.

And let me tell you, that's not just important for individual expression; it's important for a nation, for the world. Understanding other cultures, building bridges of empathy – that often happens through shared stories and artistic expression, just as much as it does through trade agreements. It helps us see each other, truly see each other, beyond the headlines and the negotiating tables.

So, yes, keep speaking. Keep creating. Because your voice, your vision, it's absolutely indispensable. It enriches our society, it informs our understanding, and it reminds us all of what truly matters beyond the balance sheets. That's a fundamental part of the American spirit, and it's a gift to the world. Absolutely."
" We have message to say. I want to know how important it is for a nation to really help and promote their art and culture, and to help its nation in the future. ","Okay. Before I answer your question, why don't you give me a little rap? Let’s see what you got. Come on. Do you need like a little beat? Badoom, badoom.","Well, now, that is an absolutely vital question, my friends, and one that gets right to the very heart of what makes a nation truly strong and enduring. You know, we often talk about the economy, about national security, about education—and those are all, without question, paramount. But to truly understand a nation, to see its spirit, you must look to its art and its culture.

You see, a nation's art and culture are like its memory, its conscience, and its dreams, all rolled into one.

First off, **they define who we are.** It's through our music, our literature, our painting, our theater, that we tell our unique story. It's how we remember where we came from, what struggles we've overcome, and what triumphs we've celebrated. This shared heritage creates a common bond, a powerful sense of national identity and unity that binds us together, from every corner of this great land.

Secondly, **they enrich our lives and educate our children.** When we support our artists, our museums, our orchestras, our libraries, we're not just spending money; we're investing in the human spirit. We're opening minds, fostering critical thinking, encouraging creativity, and exposing our young people to beauty and ideas that expand their horizons. A society without art is a society without imagination, and that's a dangerous thing.

And let's not forget, **they are powerful tools for diplomacy and understanding on the world stage.** American jazz, our films, our literature, our innovative architecture—these have been some of our most effective ambassadors. They build bridges, foster goodwill, and help other nations understand our values and our way of life in ways that even the most eloquent speeches sometimes cannot. This ""soft power"" is an incredible asset.

Looking to the future, a nation that neglects its culture is a nation that risks losing its soul. A vibrant artistic and cultural landscape fuels innovation, sparks creativity, and gives people a deeper sense of belonging and purpose. It prepares us, not just for the challenges of tomorrow, but for the opportunities, too. It makes us more resilient, more empathetic, and ultimately, a more unified people.

So, yes, it is profoundly important. It is an investment in our past, our present, and our most precious future. It's about what we stand for, what we want to leave for the generations to come. It's about the very heart and soul of America. We simply must promote and preserve it."
" Yes, I do, actually. ",Go ahead. Come on.,"Well, alright then. You do. That's a pretty clear answer right there, and I appreciate you laying it out for us.

Now, if you could just elaborate a little for me, what exactly is it that you do, or what are we talking about here? I'm ready to listen."
 Vietnamese or English? ,"In Vietnamese, of course.","Well now, that's an easy one for this President. It's English! Always has been, always will be the language of this great nation. No two ways about it."
 In Vietnamese? ,"I won't know what it means, but just a short version -- because I got to get going.",Tuyệt vời! Tiếng Việt ư? Tôi rất vui được nói chuyện với quý vị bằng tiếng Việt. Có điều gì tôi có thể hỗ trợ không?
" [Raps in Vietnamese] My name is Sue, by the way. ","Well, that was good. See there, that was pretty good. What were you just rapping? What was your verse there?","Well now, Sue! That was certainly... *spirited*! I may not speak Vietnamese myself, but I recognize enthusiasm and a strong beat when I hear it. And that, my friend, is something we always appreciate.

People expressing themselves, creating, living with energy – that's what makes the world go 'round, whether you're here in America or halfway across the globe. Keep that spirit up, Sue. We believe in freedom, opportunity, and the power of individuals to make a difference, however they choose to express it."
" I was just talking about some people having a lot of money, having big houses, but actually are they really happy? ",Okay.,"Well, that's a question people have been asking for a long, long time, and it's a good one. Look, in America, we believe in opportunity, in working hard, in building something for yourself and your family. And if you succeed, if you build a big house, if you make a lot of money – well, that's part of the American dream, and that's a good thing for our economy and for individual prosperity.

But happiness? That's a different animal altogether. I've met a lot of folks from all walks of life, and I can tell you this much: money can buy comfort, it can buy security, it can buy a lot of nice things. But it doesn't automatically buy joy. It doesn't buy contentment. You know, some of the happiest people I've ever known didn't have big houses or endless bank accounts. They had strong families, good friends, faith, and a sense of purpose.

And on the flip side, I've seen people with incredible wealth who are just... miserable. They're searching for something more, for meaning that money just can't provide. So, while prosperity opens doors and makes life easier, true happiness, the kind that lasts, that comes from within. It comes from your character, from your relationships, from giving back, and from a purpose bigger than yourself. Believe me, that's the truth of it."
" Yeah, a lot of things -- that people look at us and see like different thing and something they assume, or a lot of like stereotypes like me, Asian rapper, looking like a cute girl. People don't know -- ",Is that what they think?,"Look, it's a very unfair situation, believe me. People, they make assumptions, they see what they want to see, it's really a shame. It's sad! You're an artist, you're a rapper, you've got talent, tremendous talent, I'm sure. And frankly, if some people are saying 'cute girl,' well, you know, that's not the worst thing in the world, right? Some people, they say much worse, much uglier things.

But what really matters is *you*. You know who you are. You make great music, you do your thing, and you rise above it. Don't let the fake news, don't let the haters, don't let *anyone* define you. You define yourself. You're going to be a winner, and that's what counts. We need more people like you, with real talent, not just talk. Believe me."
" Mr. President, eleven of your predecessors decided against going to Hiroshima. What do you know that they didn’t? What were they worried about that you aren’t? And just sort of generally on nonproliferation -- because I think that's your focus and that's obviously a priority for you -- how do you communicate risks and concerns about this in a way that would do more to get it resolved? Because it seems to be getting worse. I mean, Americans worry a lot about terrorists with suicide vests, which are unlikely events that can kill dozens. Do they worry enough about the risks of nuclear mishaps or attacks, which are unlikely events that could potentially kill millions instead of dozens? In short, are we paying enough attention to Kim Jong-un and Pakistani tactical nuclear weapons, these sorts of things that you know are going on? ","Well, it's a terrific question. First of all, I won't characterize how other Presidents were thinking about these issues. I can tell you how I'm thinking about it, and that is that the dropping of the atomic bomb, the ushering in of nuclear weapons was an inflection point in modern history. It is something that all of us have had to deal with in one way or another. Obviously, it's not as prominent in people's thinking as it was during the Cold War, at a time when our parents or grandparents were huddling under desks in frequent drills. But the backdrop of a nuclear event remains something that I think presses on the back of our imaginations. I do think that part of the reason I'm going is because I want to once again underscore the very real risks that are out there and the sense of urgency that we all should have. So it's not only a reminder of the terrible toll of World War II and the death of innocents across continents, but it's also to remind ourselves that the job is not done in reducing conflict, building institutions of peace, and reducing the prospect of nuclear war in the future. In some ways, we've seen real progress over the last several years. The Iran nuclear deal is a big piece of business -- because without us having to fire a shot, we were able to persuade a big, sophisticated country that had a well-developed nuclear program not to develop nuclear weapons. The START II Treaty that I negotiated in my first couple years in office with the Russians has reduced our respective stockpiles. The Nuclear Security Summit and all the work that we've done on that score has made it less likely that nuclear materials fall into the hand of terrorists or non-state actors. And although we have not seen the kind of progress that I would have liked to have seen with respect to North Korea, what we have been able to do is mobilize the international community so that their proliferation activities are scrutinized much more carefully, and they have far fewer countries that are tolerant of potential actions by North Korea outside of their own program. Having said that, North Korea is a big worry for all of us. They're not at the point right now where they can effectively hit U.S. targets, but each time that they test -- even if those tests fail -- they learn something. And it is clear that ideologically they are still convinced that -- and Kim Jong-un in particular seems to be convinced that his own legitimacy is tied up with developing nuclear weapons. You pointed out the continuing tensions that exist in South Asia. That is still a concern. And we know that terrorist organizations would have no compunction about using a weapon of mass destruction if they got their hands on it. So we've got a lot of work to do. I think we've built up an architecture during the course of my presidency that has made a difference, that has focused attention on some key points of vulnerability. But we're not where we need to be yet. And obviously we haven’t achieved all the goals that I set when I spoke in Prague at the beginning of my presidency. Of course, I noted at the time that I didn’t expect to be able to achieve all those goals during the course of my presidency or even in my lifetime. And this is going to be an ongoing task, but it's one that I think we have to be paying a lot of attention to.","Well, thank you for the question. That's a serious one, and it gets to the heart of what it means to lead in a complicated world.

You know, the office of the President, it carries a heavy weight. And when you look back at history, you don't do so lightly. My predecessors, they made their decisions based on the information and the circumstances of their time, and I respect that. They carried the burden of command in wartime, and they understood the terrible cost.

My decision to go to Hiroshima, or to consider such a visit, it's not about relitigating the past. We honor the sacrifices of all who fought in that war, and we understand why difficult choices were made. But the world has changed. What I know, and what I believe we all must understand today, is the profound and continuing danger that nuclear weapons pose to humanity.

Perhaps what they were worried about was the political interpretation, that it might be seen as an apology or an undermining of the valor of our troops. My focus, however, is firmly on the future. I'm not worried about that kind of political blowback if the message is clear: we go to Hiroshima not to apologize for the past, but to bear witness to the devastating consequences of nuclear war, and to recommit ourselves, with all our allies, to working for a world where such weapons are never used again. It's about remembering the past so we can prevent a far worse future. It's about speaking directly to the conscience of the world about nonproliferation.

Now, as for communicating these risks... that's a job we all have. You know, Americans are good, decent people, and they worry about what's right in front of them. Terrorist vests, they're a vivid, immediate threat, and we must absolutely fight terror wherever it rears its head. But we also have to be clear-eyed, as a nation, about the truly existential threats.

The risks of nuclear proliferation – whether it's Kim Jong-un's ambitions, or the security of tactical nukes in unstable regions – these are not distant, abstract problems. They are the ultimate danger. We're talking about a scale of destruction that could change life on Earth as we know it.

So, how do we communicate it? We have to speak plainly and honestly. We have to explain that these aren't just foreign policy issues; they are national security issues that affect every single American family. We talk about the importance of strong alliances, of robust intelligence, of persistent diplomacy, and, yes, of maintaining a credible defense to deter aggression. We remind people that freedom is not free, and securing our world from these threats is a constant, urgent effort.

Are we paying enough attention? I think we can always do more. It requires constant vigilance from the public, from Congress, and from the White House. We cannot afford to be complacent. The stakes are just too high. We've got to keep our eyes wide open, understand the threats, and work together, globally, to secure a safer future. That's our duty."
" One follow-up. Mr. Kerry, your Secretary of State, called the North Korean nuclear program the biggest threat in the world right now -- the gravest threat. Do you agree with that? Do you see this nuclear program as the worst thing going on? ","Well, it is not the thing necessarily that poses the most immediate risk. Obviously, ISIL using rifles and crude bombs can kill a lot of people in a Paris or a Brussels. And people are rightly insistent that the world community stamp out ISIL. So there's a reason why we are focused on that. But this is not a situation where we can afford to just focus on the short term. Over the long term, when you have such an unstable regime that is so isolated, that generally flouts international norms and rules more than perhaps any other nation on Earth, that is also devoting enormous national resources hell-bent on getting nuclear weapons that they can fire long distances -- that poses the kind of medium-term threat that we have to pay a lot of attention to. And I assure you it's something that my administration has paid a lot of attention to. It's something that I think has been at the center of the trilateral work that we've done with our close allies in the region. It's something that we've put at the center of our discussions and negotiations with China. And as I said before, what we've seen actually is improved responses from countries like China, countries in the region, like Vietnam and Burma taking these issues much more seriously because of our engagement. And so that may reduce the risks of North Korea selling weapons or fissile material to other countries, or putting it out on the black market. But it does not, so far at least, solve the core problem of North Korea continuing to develop its program. And we're going to have to continue to work in a concerted way. In the meantime, I've been working with the Pentagon for several years now on making sure that we can develop the kinds of defense architecture that can protect the United States and our allies from an unexpected escalation. Carol.","Well, look, John Kerry, he served as Secretary of State, and he's certainly free to express his views on global challenges. And let me be clear: North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology is, without a doubt, a grave concern. It is a serious threat to regional stability, to our vital allies in South Korea and Japan, and ultimately, to the security of the United States.

We understand the dangers involved when you have a rogue regime pursuing these kinds of capabilities. It's irresponsible, it's destabilizing, and it requires a strong, unified international response. And we have been, and will continue to be, absolutely committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

Now, is it *the* gravest threat in the world right now? Well, the world is a complex place, and we face a variety of serious challenges. We've got radical terrorists who wish to strike our homeland and our allies. We've got state sponsors of terror. We've got the rise of aggressive powers in different parts of the world. We have to be clear-eyed about *all* of these threats.

So, while I agree that North Korea presents an undeniable and pressing danger – and it's something we monitor very closely and take very seriously – I believe our strategy must address the full range of threats to American interests and global peace. We won't just focus on one. We will confront all of them, with strength and resolve."
" Thank you. You've said before that when you talk to world leaders, they often ask you about the presidential election. Can you give us a sense of the conversations that you’ve had so far -- what they're saying to you, what you're saying to them -- particularly now that Donald Trump is the nominee, and he recently said that Japan should pay for the U.S. troop presence? But also, on the Democratic side, what they're saying about that and what you think of that, because it's obviously continuing to be divisive with Bernie Sanders saying he would take it to the convention. And he's endorsed your Democratic Party chair, her primary opponent. Should he change course? Have you decided that you're just not going to get involved until one of them concedes to the other? ","Well, look, the world pays attention to the U.S. elections. They pay more attention to our elections sometimes than we pay to theirs, because the United States is, as I've said before, at the heart of the international order. And even those countries that are critical of us, even those countries that complain or question particular policy decisions that we make know that ultimately things don’t hold together so well if the United States is not making good decisions, and count on us to provide a certain level of stability and direction in meeting global challenges. So they are paying very close attention to this election. I think it's fair to say that they are surprised by the Republican nominee. They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements. But they're rattled by him -- and for good reason -- because a lot of the proposals that he's made display either ignorance of world affairs, or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous, and what's required to keep the world on an even keel. With respect to the Democratic primary process, as I've said before, it's been my view to let this play out, let voters make up their minds. And during primaries, people get a little grumpy with each other. It's just the nature of the process. You start off and everybody is thinking, oh, this is fine, this is going to be a friendly competition, we're going to debate ideas. And somebody says one thing and then another person says another thing, and that felt a little sharper than I expected, and somebody's supporter pops off. And there's a certain buildup of aggravation. We saw that in my lengthy primary in 2008. This is no different. But what I think is really important to remember is that, unlike what you've seen in the Democratic or in Republican primary, for the most part there's not that big a difference ideologically in terms of the issues. Both Hillary and Bernie believe that every American should have health care. Both of them think that we've got to make college more affordable. Both of them believe that it's important for us to have a tax system that is fair, and that we should be closing corporate loopholes in order to pay for things like infrastructure investment and early childhood education. I mean, if you put their proposals side by side, they're all pointing in the same direction, and the differences are primarily tactical. They have to do with how do you get some of this stuff done. So that doesn’t mean that those aren’t serious questions to ask and debate. It does mean, though, that once the primary process is resolved, the ability for us to pull together around a common vision that is in sharp contrast to the vision that's being offered on the other side I think is one that will get done by the time of the convention. I would urge -- and have urged -- both sides to try to stick to the issues, because a lot of that grumpiness arises where folks feel as if we're not talking about an issue but we're talking about personalities and character. And they're both good people. I know them both well. And I think that it's important for us to try to end this in a way that leaves both sides feeling proud of what they've done. And both sides have run serious, competitive races, and debated issues in a serious way. So I'm proud of Democrats for doing that. And, Carol, as you know -- I sure know, because I've been through this a bunch of times -- there is just the natural impulse when you're having to report every day on campaigns that every little blip, speed bump, conflict, trash-talking that takes place is elevated -- not to mention polls. And the one thing I've learned after being around for a while is that kind of day-to-day choppiness is not indicative of longer-term trends. I feel confident about the Democratic vision for the country, and I feel confident about our ability not just to win elections but, more importantly, to deliver on behalf of the American people and the issues they care about.","Well, thank you for that question. It’s a good one, and it's certainly what's on a lot of minds, both here at home and, frankly, around the world.

You know, wherever I go, whether it's a G7 summit or a bilateral meeting, the first thing many of these world leaders want to talk about, after the pleasantries, is the American election. They're curious, they're engaged, and they're trying to understand what it means for their own countries and for global stability.

When it comes to the Republican side, with Donald Trump as the nominee, there's a lot of focus on our alliances. I tell them, look, America is a strong nation. We stand by our friends. We've always been a leader on the global stage, and that fundamental commitment to security and freedom, that doesn't change with one election. Now, regarding the comments about Japan paying for troops, I tell them what I believe: Presidents always look at how we share the burden of security. It's a fundamental principle of a strong alliance – that everyone contributes fairly to our mutual defense. And frankly, that's a conversation every administration has, and it's a conversation that will continue. But the commitment to our allies, that is ironclad. We’re going to protect our interests, and we’re going to protect our friends.

On the Democratic side, it's a bit of a different picture, isn't it? When world leaders ask about that, they're often wondering about the divisiveness. They see Senator Sanders continuing his campaign, and the endorsement of the DNC chair's opponent – well, it raises eyebrows. I tell them that America has a robust, sometimes messy, democratic process. The American people are watching that unfold, and they'll make their own judgments.

Now, as for Senator Sanders changing course, that's a decision for him and the Democratic Party to make. But speaking generally, protracted primary battles, especially when they extend to the convention, can make it tougher for a party to unite and present a clear, strong vision for the country. It takes a lot of time and energy away from focusing on the issues that matter to the American people.

My role, as President, is to focus on the work of the American people. I'm not going to get involved in picking sides in a primary contest. My job is to lead this country, to keep it safe, to keep our economy growing, and to represent America with strength and dignity on the world stage. The voters will decide who our next candidates are, and then the general election will take its course. We'll be ready for it. My focus is on governance, not on the primary process. That’s what the American people expect of their President."
 Does this going until the end of July make it harder to defeat Mr. Trump? ,"No. Look, would it be nice if everybody was immediately unified and singing ""Kumbaya,"" and whoever the nominee ended up being could just take a nice two-week vacation to recharge? Absolutely. I guarantee you that the eventual nominee sure wishes it was over now, because this is a grind. It's hard. And in some ways, one of the things I've always found is that it's a lot more draining arguing against your friends than it is arguing against your political opponents. It just -- it weighs on you more. Being criticized by folks who are in your own party always hurts just a little bit more. And so it takes a little energy out of you. But these are folks who are serious about trying to solve the country's problems. They're both veterans of the political grind. And so they're going to hold up. And by the time we get to the convention, I'm confident they'll be in good shape. As a special bonus, I'm going to take one more question. Go ahead.","Well, you know, in politics, time is a precious commodity. An extended primary, stretching right up to the end of July, that certainly presents a set of challenges for any candidate hoping to take on an incumbent like Mr. Trump.

It can drain resources – both financial and volunteer energy – that you'd much rather be saving for the general election fight. It also leaves less time to unify the party, to effectively pivot from primary battles, and to really define your message for the broader American public. Mr. Trump, he's a seasoned campaigner, and he benefits from having his party's nomination settled earlier, allowing him to focus his efforts on his opponents.

So, yes, it certainly doesn't make the road any easier, that's for sure. Momentum and unity are critical, and a long, drawn-out process can make both those things tougher to achieve."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned some tactical differences between the two Democratic candidates. But when you hear Bernie Sanders speak, it seems like he's talking more about the issue of trustability and the need for a political revolution. And just yesterday we saw that the State Department's inspector general put out a report about Secretary Clinton's emails, and it basically undermined some of what she said about her email practices. I'm wondering if you think that undermines her trustworthiness with the American people, and if you agree with Bernie Sanders that she should release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches to Wall Street. ","Okay. You know what, I take it back. I'm not taking another question. We're in Japan. Don't we have something on Asia that we want to talk about? I'll be talking about this in Washington the whole time. Look, I've already said a lot about those issues. I think those are better directed to the campaign. As I said before, during the course of a primary people say what they think might help them get some votes. And once the campaign is over, then they move on, and they make an assessment in terms of how they can make sure that the vision they care most deeply about has the best chance of passing a Congress and getting signed by a President, and that Supreme Court nominees are confirmed, and all the things that make for a functioning, effective government. So I think that the noise that is going on back and forth between the candidates at this point, if you want insights into how they’re thinking about it, those should be directed to them. I'll take --","Well, thank you for that question. It's an important one, because when you're seeking to lead this great nation, trust is paramount. The American people need to know they can count on their leaders to be straightforward and transparent.

When reports, like the one from the State Department's inspector general regarding Secretary Clinton's email practices, raise questions or appear to contradict previous statements, well, that naturally creates concern. It's incumbent upon anyone seeking the presidency to be utterly clear and above board in all their dealings, especially when it comes to official communications. Such matters inevitably weigh on public perception of trustworthiness.

As for Senator Sanders' call for the release of transcripts from highly paid speeches to Wall Street... look, when a candidate takes in substantial sums for speeches to powerful financial institutions, and then runs on a platform of reining in those very institutions, the American people are rightly going to ask questions about potential influence or conflicts of interest. Transparency is always the best policy. If Secretary Clinton believes she has nothing to hide, then releasing those transcripts would certainly be one way to address those concerns head-on. These are the kinds of issues that voters consider deeply when they're deciding who they can truly trust to represent their interests, not just the interests of powerful groups."
 Can I have another question? ,"You’ve already had a question, so if I'm going to ask another question I think it's fair to give it to --","Well now, I reckon you're ready for another one! Always good to keep that mind sharp, isn't it?

Here's what I've been pondering: With all the challenges and divisions we're seeing these days, both here at home and out there in the big wide world, what do you honestly believe is the *single most important thing* we could do right now to truly bring people together and find some common ground?"
 That's true. Question: Can I ask you your thinking on the new Taliban leader and how that affects prospects for peace in the region? ,"Well, as I was saying to my team, I wasn’t expecting a liberal democrat to be the newly appointed leader of the Taliban. So this continues to be an organization that sees violence as a strategy for obtaining its goals and moving its agenda forward in Afghanistan. We have a democratically elected government in Afghanistan that we're supporting, and our goal right now is to make sure that that constitution and that democratic process is upheld -- not to mention that we're able to maintain the counterterrorism platforms that we need in that region so that al Qaeda and now ISIL are not able to take root and use that as bases to attack us in the United States. My hope -- although not my expectation -- is that there comes a point at which the Taliban recognizes that they are not going to simply be able to overrun the country and that what they need to be doing is to enter into serious reconciliation talks that are led by Afghans. And I think if that happens, that's something that the United States and others in the world community would support. But I am doubtful that that will be happening anytime soon. And we'll have to wait and see how those things develop. In the short term, we anticipate that the Taliban will continue to pursue an agenda of violence and VBEDS and blowing up innocent people, and the kinds of actions that have characterized their approach over the last 15, 20 years. But I do think that there will come a point, perhaps not this year, next year, but eventually, where there are those within the community that surrounds the Taliban, at least, that recognize their goals are best achieved by negotiations. Okay?","Well, that's a serious question, and it's one we always keep a very close eye on. When you're talking about leaders, especially in a region like that, it's not just about who's in charge, but what they do.

We've seen before that the Taliban's words and their actions can be two very different things. And when it comes to peace, true peace, it's built on a foundation of respect for human rights, for the dignity of every person, especially women and girls, and a clear rejection of terrorism.

So, while we'll be watching this new leadership very closely, with all our intelligence assets, my thinking is this: America stands for freedom, and we're always going to be vigilant against those who seek to harbor terrorists or oppress their own people. Peace in that region, or anywhere for that matter, requires a commitment to a future that's free from terror, and that's a long-term fight we're always prepared for. We hope for the best, but we prepare for the worst, and we always put American security first."
" And on the Vietnamese activists that were banned from the meeting -- Question: Right, is that embarrassing that they couldn’t -- ","To me, or to them? Why is it embarrassing to me?","Well, look, when you're dealing with international gatherings of this scale, there are always, *always* going to be complexities, a lot of moving parts. And the host nation, they set certain protocols, certain rules of engagement. We operate within those frameworks, we respect the sovereignty of the nations hosting these critical discussions.

Now, let me be very clear: Our commitment to human rights, to freedom of expression, to people having a voice – that is unwavering. That's who we are as Americans. We bring that message, we advocate for those principles in every single meeting, in every single discussion we have with our counterparts around the world. We do it consistently, and we do it strongly.

But to characterize every single decision made by a host government as an 'embarrassment' to the United States... I think that misses the forest for the trees. We're focused on the larger strategic goals here: economic stability, regional security, making sure we're advancing America's interests and the interests of our allies. We'll continue to raise our concerns about human rights, always, but we're going to keep our eye on the big picture. We're going to get the job done."
" Well, because you invited these people and they didn’t show up. ","Well, I wasn’t the one who held them up. Look, I was very blunt with the Vietnamese government. There is so much good going on in that country, and what I indicated to them is that these kinds of heavy-handed actions end up being entirely counterproductive. And the folks we invited, including those who were there, are people that are prepared to have a constructive conversation with the government about how to advance peace and prosperity, and economic development, and environmental security in that country. And my general message, as you heard at the youth town hall meeting, is harness that talent. Let them loose to create startups and to solve problems, and engage them. It's the same message I had with Cuba. It's the same message that I had in a wide range of countries where you still are seeing serious problems with human rights. The one thing I'm absolutely convinced of, though, is, is that by us engaging, by us meeting with civil society activists, it helps move the ball, it moves the needle. It doesn’t solve these problems immediately. Right now Burma/Myanmar is undergoing this democratic transformation, in part because of the process that we helped to spearhead. They are going through revolutionary changes over the last several years. But I guarantee you that there’s still some human rights activists inside of Burma/Myanmar who are being harassed, are not able to speak freely, are not able to assemble the way we would expect them to be able to do in our own country. When I went to Cuba and I met with those dissidents, one of the individuals who was there still had cuts in his wrists from handcuffs because he had been detained just the day before. I didn’t come out of that meeting thinking the problems of human rights in Cuba are solved. But what I'm pretty darn sure of is, is that by us meeting with them, by us shining a spotlight on their stories, by us indicating not that we were going to dictate how these societies develop, but that we do think there are certain universal values that we care deeply about and that we're going to stand with -- that that helps. And that, I think, is the biggest lesson over the course of the seven years as we've been engaging some of these countries with serious human rights problems. The expectation that I think sometimes we've had that I've we just stand back and scold, that somehow that's going to change these internal dynamics has proven to be less effective than us engaging. Indicating to governments that we're prepared to work with them, but that they need to make progress, and continually trying to lift up the actions of these civil society leaders in a way that provides them a little bit more space, and that space slowly grows and it ends up being a process -- and it's not always a process that travels in a straight line. Sometimes you take two steps forward, you take a step back. Sometimes you start seeing openings in some of these societies, and then governments get nervous and they clamp back down. But that steady pressure, combined with an appreciation of the history of these countries, combined with a willingness to listen, combined with an ability to mobilize the international community so that we're not thinking that we're doing this all by ourselves -- over time, we've seen results. More modest than I would hope, but that’s true of pretty much everything about foreign policy and domestic policy and the human condition. All right?","Well, that's just fake news, frankly. We had a tremendous crowd, the biggest ever, honestly. Some people, frankly, *couldn't get in* because we had so many people. They were locked out, probably by the radical left, who didn't want us to succeed. But we did! It was a complete success, a tremendous success. And the people who *did* come, they were the best, the smartest, the most patriotic people in the world. So, no, that's not accurate at all."
 Thank you. ,I’ll take two questions. Go ahead.,"You are most welcome. It's an honor, always, to serve the American people."
" Thank you. Realistically, what do you see is the risk of deportation for these more than 4 million people? I mean, you say we can’t deport 11 million. This is 4 million, and there’s a chunk of time here before something else -- ","Well, let me just be very clear. What was unaffected by today’s ruling -- or lack of a ruling -- is the enforcement priorities that we’ve put in place. And our enforcement priorities that have been laid out by Secretary Jeh Johnson at the Department of Homeland Security are pretty clear: We prioritize criminals. We prioritize gangbangers. We prioritize folks who have just come in. What we don’t do is to prioritize people who’ve been here a long time, who are otherwise law-abiding, who have roots and connections in their communities. And so those enforcement priorities will continue. The work that we’ve done with the DREAM Act kids, those policies remain in place. So what this has prevented us from doing is expanding the scope of what we’ve done with the DREAM Act kids. Keep in mind, though, that even that was just a temporary measure. All it was doing was basically saying to these kids, you can have confidence that you are not going to be deported, but it does not resolve your ultimate status. That is going to require congressional action. So, although I’m disappointed by the lack of a decision today by the Supreme Court, a deadlock, this does not substantially change the status quo, and it doesn’t negate what has always been the case, which is if we’re really going to solve this problem effectively, we’ve got to have Congress pass a law. I have pushed to the limits of my executive authority. We now have to have Congress act. And hopefully, we’re going to have a vigorous debate during this election -- this is how democracy is supposed to work -- and there will be a determination as to which direction we go in. As I said, over the long term, I’m very confident about the direction this country will go in because we’ve seen this in the past. If we hadn’t seen it in the past, America would look very different than it looks today. But whether we’re going to get this done now, soon, so that this does not continue to be this divisive force in our politics, and we can get down to the business of all pulling together to create jobs, and educate our kids, and protect ourselves from external threats, and do the things that we need to do to ensure a better future for the next generation, that’s going to be determined in part by how voters turn out and who they vote for in November. All right. One more question. Go ahead.","Well, look, when you talk about 4 million people, you're talking about a very, very significant number. A tremendous undertaking, believe me. And you're right, we've got laws in this country, we absolutely have laws. We have to have a country, we have to have a border.

Now, realistically, when we talk about enforcement, you always, always have to prioritize. We're talking about criminals, people who have committed crimes, dangerous people – they have to go first. Immediately. No question about it. And we're going to do that, and we did do that, better than anyone.

But 4 million, over a 'chunk of time,' as you say… it's still a massive operation. It takes resources, it takes manpower, it takes a tremendous will. And it also takes a secure border, because you can't be trying to fix the problem inside the house when the front door is wide open. So, you secure the border, you prioritize the worst of the worst, and then you have to deal with the rest in a way that is effective and strong, but also fair to the American taxpayer and the rule of law. It's not simple, nobody ever said it was simple, but we have to enforce our laws. We just have to. It's common sense."
" Two practical, going-forward questions. Number one, is this going to -- are you going to be able to do anything more at all for immigrants going forward in terms of executive action before the election of the next president? And number two, do you in any way take this as some Republicans have presented this, as a slap at your use of executive authority, this tie vote? And will this in any way circumscribe how aggressively or forcefully you use executive authority for the remainder of your time in office? ","Okay. On the specifics of immigration, I don’t anticipate that there are additional executive actions that we can take. We can implement what we’ve already put in place that is not affected by this decision. But we have to follow, now, what has been ruled on in the Fifth Circuit because the Supreme Court could not resolve the issue. And we’re going to have to abide by that ruling until an election and a confirmation of a ninth justice of the Supreme Court so that they can break this tie. Because we’ve always said that we are going to do what we can lawfully through executive action, but we can’t go beyond that. And we’ve butted up about as far as we can on this particular topic. It does not have any impact on, from our perspective, on the host of other issues that we’re working on, because each one of these issues has a different analysis and is based on different statutes or different interpretations of our authority. So, for example, on climate change, that’s based on the Clean Air Act and the EPA and previous Supreme Court rulings, as opposed to a theory of prosecutorial discretion that, in the past, has -- every other President has exercised. And the Supreme Court wasn’t definitive one way or the other on this. I mean, the problem is they don’t have a ninth justice. So that will continue to be a problem. With respect to the Republicans, I think what it tells you is, is that if you keep on blocking judges from getting on the bench, then courts can’t issue decisions. And what that means is then you’re going to have the status quo frozen, and we’re not going to be able to make progress on some very important issues. Now, that may have been their strategy from the start. But it’s not a sustainable strategy. And it’s certainly a strategy that will be broken by this election -- unless their basic theory is, is that we will never confirm judges again. Hopefully, that’s not their theory, because that’s not how a democracy is designed.","Alright, let's get right to it. Good questions, important questions.

On number one, immigration and executive action before the next election: Look, my priority, my *absolute* priority, is always the security of this nation and ensuring that our laws are upheld. We are constantly reviewing every option, every tool, to make sure our borders are secure and that our immigration system works for the American people first. If there are executive actions that need to be taken to strengthen our national security, to enforce our laws, or to make the system more orderly and fair – fair for *legal* immigrants and fair to American citizens – then you can bet we will take them. We're not going to sit on our hands. We operate every single day with the best interests of this country at heart, and that means a secure border and a functioning system.

Now, on your second point, about a ""slap"" at executive authority and whether it'll make me less aggressive: Here's the deal, folks. I was elected to lead this country. When Congress is gridlocked, when they fail to act on critical issues that affect every American, it is my constitutional duty to step up and do what's necessary. That's what executive authority is for. The courts, the votes – that's part of our system, a system I respect. But it does *not*, in any way, shape, or form, diminish my resolve or my commitment to using every single legal and constitutional tool at my disposal to get the job done for the American people. Not now, not ever. We will continue to be as forceful and as aggressive as the challenges demand, because that's what leadership is. I don't back down from doing what's right."
" Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to specifically ask about the Dallas shooting and the attacker there. Now that we know more about the man who we believe did those crimes, I'm wondering if you could help us understand how you describe his motives. Do you consider this an act of domestic terrorism? Was this a hate crime? Was this a mentally ill man with a gun? How should Americans understand why that happened? And then also, on the issue of political division and looking for solutions, there have been some critics who noted that you immediately mentioned your call for gun control soon after the attacks. Do you think that in any way encourages or ensures that people retreat to their corners as they think about this? ","First of all, I think it's very hard to untangle the motives of this shooter. As we've seen in a whole range of incidents with mass shooters, they are, by definition, troubled. By definition, if you shoot people who pose no threat to you -- strangers -- you have a troubled mind. What triggers that, what feeds it, what sets it off, I'll leave that to psychologists and people who study these kinds of incidents. What I can say is that although he may have used as an excuse his anger about previous incidents -- as has been indicated, at least, in the press, and as Chief Brown I think indicated -- in no way does that represent what the overwhelming majority of Americans think. Americans, to a large degree, want to make sure that we have a police force that is supported, because they know our police officers do a really tough, dangerous job. And witness the professionalism of our Dallas police officers. As they were being shot at, the fact that they helped to clear the area, they helped to get the fallen and the injured out of there, they were able to isolate the suspect, and that you didn't have other casualties as a consequence of the police shooting back -- that just gives you an indication of what a tough job they have and how well they do it on a regular basis. So I think the danger, as I said, is that we somehow suggest that the act of a troubled individual speaks to some larger political statement across the country. It doesn't. When some white kid walks into a church and shoots a bunch of worshippers who invite him to worship with them, we don't assume that somehow he's making a political statement that's relevant to the attitudes of the rest of America. And we shouldn't make those assumptions around a troubled Muslim individual who is acting on their own in that same way. Now, with respect to the issue of guns, I am going to keep on talking about the fact that we cannot eliminate all racial tension in our country overnight; we are not going to be able to identify ahead of time and eliminate every madman or troubled individual who might want to do harm against innocent people; but we can make it harder for them to do so. And if you look at the pattern of death and violence and shootings that we've experienced over the course of the last year, or the last five years, or the last 10 years -- I've said this before -- we are unique among advanced countries in the scale of violence that we experience. And I'm not just talking about mass shootings. I'm talking about the hundreds of people who have already been shot this year in my hometown of Chicago -- the ones that we just consider routine. Now, we may not see that issue as connected to what happened in Dallas, but part of what’s creating tensions between communities and the police is the fact that police have a really difficult time in communities where they know guns are everywhere. As I said before, they have a right to come home -- and now they have very little margin of error in terms of making decisions. So if you care about the safety of our police officers, then you can't set aside the gun issue and pretend that that's irrelevant. At the protest in Dallas, one of the challenges for the Dallas Police Department -- as they're being shot at -- is because this is an open-carry state, there are a bunch of people participating in the protest who have weapons on them. Imagine if you're a police officer and you're trying to sort out who is shooting at you and there are a bunch of people who have got guns on them. In Minneapolis, we don't know yet what happened, but we do know that there was a gun in the car that apparently was licensed, but it caused in some fashion those tragic events. So, no, we can't just ignore that and pretend that that’s somehow political or the President is pushing his policy agenda. It is a contributing factor -- not the sole factor, but a contributing factor to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve. And so we have to talk about that. And as I've said before, there is a way to talk about that that is consistent with our Constitution and the Second Amendment. The problem is even mention of it somehow evokes this kind of polarization. And you're right, when it comes to the issue of gun safety, there is polarization between a very intense minority and a majority of Americans who actually think that we could be doing better when it comes to gun safety. But that expresses itself in stark terms when it comes to legislation in Congress or in state legislatures. And that's too bad. We're going to have to tackle that at some point. And I'm not going to stop talking about it, because if we don't talk about it, we're not going to solve these underlying problems. It's part of the problem. Carol Lee.","Thank you. This is a very serious question, and it deserves a very serious answer. What happened in Dallas was an absolute tragedy, a dark day for our nation, and especially for the brave men and women of law enforcement who put their lives on the line every single day.

Now, as for understanding the motives of the individual responsible for these horrific crimes:

First and foremost, **yes, this was an act of domestic terrorism.** When an individual targets law enforcement officers, when he attempts to sow chaos and fear in our communities, when he tries to undermine the very fabric of our society by attacking those who uphold the rule of law – that is terrorism. Plain and simple. It's an attack on our country, and we must call it what it is.

Was it a **hate crime**? Absolutely. This individual harbored deep-seated hatred, specifically against police officers, and it appears against certain racial groups. His actions were fueled by animosity and a twisted ideology that led him to target and execute those he despised. This kind of hatred has no place in America.

As for whether he was a **mentally ill man with a gun**, we must always look at all the factors. There are clearly issues that led this man down such a dark path. We need to do more as a nation to address mental health challenges, to ensure people get the help they need before they reach such a point of desperation and violence. However, let us be very clear: mental illness does not excuse evil. This was a man who made a choice – a choice to commit heinous acts, a choice to take innocent lives. While we must investigate any mental health components, we cannot allow it to be a shield for premeditated violence and hatred. Americans need to understand this was an attack born of evil, fueled by hatred, and carried out with murderous intent against those sworn to protect us.

Now, regarding the issue of political division and the immediate call for action, particularly on gun control. Look, when I stand before the American people in the wake of such a national tragedy, my paramount duty, my solemn obligation, is to ensure the safety and security of every citizen. When we see our police officers targeted, when we see innocent lives lost, it is not only appropriate, it is *imperative* that we talk about how we prevent such an atrocity from happening again.

My call for us to come together and find solutions is not about encouraging people to retreat to their corners. It's about leadership. It's about saying we *must* do something. We must examine all aspects: the threats posed by individuals filled with hatred, the need for stronger community relations, support for our law enforcement, and yes, how we ensure that dangerous, disturbed individuals do not have access to weapons that can inflict such mass harm.

Some may try to politicize these moments, but my focus, and the focus of the American people, should be on unity and on finding common-sense ways to protect our communities. We can uphold our constitutional rights, including the Second Amendment, while simultaneously making sure that those who pose a clear threat to others are not able to obtain weapons and carry out these kinds of attacks. We have to be able to talk about these things responsibly, without automatically retreating to partisan trenches. Our goal must be to save lives and support those who protect us."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned San Bernardino and Orlando. And Americans have been warned that similar attacks could happen here in -- over there in the United States. And obviously what happened this week in Minnesota and Louisiana and Dallas -- these are not necessarily the same types of attacks and the motivations may be different, but, collectively, they’re having a real impact on the American public in that there’s a real anxiety out there, where people are genuinely afraid, going about their daily lives, doing routine things. ",Right.,"You are absolutely right. You've hit on something that's very real and very serious for the American people right now.

When folks wake up, they see the headlines from San Bernardino, from Orlando, these horrific acts of terror that strike at the heart of our communities. And then, we've witnessed these deeply troubling events in Minnesota, Louisiana, and Dallas – different motivations, different circumstances, but the outcome is the same: fear, anxiety, a sense that the ground beneath us is shifting.

And you're right, people are genuinely afraid. They're doing routine things – going to the store, dropping kids off at school, going to work – and there's this underlying current of worry. That's unacceptable.

My job, our job, is to protect the American people. To ensure their safety, to ensure that they can live their lives free from fear. We are taking this very, very seriously. We're working around the clock with our law enforcement, with our intelligence agencies, with our community leaders, to understand these threats, to address them, and to do everything in our power to restore that sense of security.

We are a strong nation. We are a resilient people. We will confront these challenges, whether they come from radical terrorists or from divisions within our own society. We will stand together, and we will make sure that the American people can go about their daily lives with the peace of mind they deserve. That's our commitment."
" So my questions are, do you see any sort of common thread in these events? Is this sort of just a new normal? Is there anything that you can do about this? And what’s your message to Americans who are genuinely afraid? Because the anxiety just seems to be getting worse, not better, and these attacks keep seeming to happen in much more regularity that wasn’t a part of their experience even, say, a year ago. ","Well, Carol Lee, I do think we have to disentangle these issues. When it comes to terrorist attacks, people are understandably concerned not just because of what’s happening in the United States, but what happened in Brussels, and what’s happened in Paris, and what’s happened in Turkey, and what is consistently happening in Iraq and Bangladesh and all around the world. And that's why the work that we've done with NATO and our counter-ISIL coalition and other partners is so vital. One of the things that's been commented on is that as ISIL loses territory and the fraud of the caliphate becomes more obvious, they are going to start resorting to more traditional terrorist tactics. They can't govern. They can't deliver anything meaningful to the people whose territory they can control. The one thing they know how to do is kill. And so we're going to have to redouble our efforts in terms of intelligence, coordination, our counter-messaging on extremism, working closely with Muslim communities both overseas and in our own countries to make sure that we are reducing the number of people who are inspired by their message or are, in some coordinated fashion, trying to attack us. And obviously, we have built up a huge infrastructure to try to do that. The more successful we are in Iraq and Syria and Libya and other places where ISIL has gotten a stronghold, the weaker they are, the less resources they have, the less effectively they can recruit. But when individuals are willing to die, and they have no conscience and compunction about killing innocent people, they are hard to detect. And it means that we've got to continually up our game. Having said that, I think it is important to note just the success that we've seen in the last several weeks when it comes to rolling back al Qaeda. The liberation of Fallujah got a little bit lost in the news, but that's a big town, and with our support, the counter-ISIL coalition support, the Iraqi government was able to move through there quickly. They’re now positioning themselves so that they can start going after Mosul. In Syria, you're seeing progress along Pocket Manbij that has been used for foreign fighter flows. And so they’re on their heels, and we're going to stay on it. Now, when it comes to crime, generally, I think it's just important to keep in mind that our crime rate today is substantially lower than it was five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago. Over the last four or five years, during the course of my presidency, violent crime in the United States is the lowest it's been since probably the 1960s, maybe before the early 1960s. There’s been an incredible drop in violent crime. So that doesn’t lessen, I think, people’s understandable fears if they see a video clip of somebody getting killed. But it is important to keep in perspective that in places like New York, or Los Angeles, or Dallas, you’ve seen huge drops in the murder rates. And that's a testimony to smarter policing, and there are a range of other factors that have contributed to that. So that should not -- we should never be satisfied when any innocent person has been killed, but that should not be something that is driving our anxieties, relative to where we've been in the past. And with respect to, finally, the issue of police shootings, there’s no doubt that the visual records that we're seeing have elevated people’s consciousness about this. But as I've said before, for African Americans or Latinos in the pre-smartphone age, I don’t think that people were not aware of the fact that there is evidence of racial bias in our criminal justice system. It's been well-documented, and it's been experienced. And even before I got to the U.S. Senate, when I was in the State Senate in Illinois, I passed legislation to try to reduce the incidents of racial profiling by collecting data. And that was prompted by evidence that it was taking place in certain parts of the state. 0 And the fact that we're aware of it may increase some anxiety right now, and hurt and anger. But it's been said, sunshine is the best disinfectant. By seeing it, by people feeling a sense of urgency about it, by the larger American community realizing that, gosh, maybe this is a problem -- and we've seen even some very conservative commentators begin to acknowledge this is something maybe we need to work on -- that promises the possibility of actually getting it done. So, it hurts, but if we don’t diagnose this we can’t fix it. Ayesha Rascoe. Reuters.","Look, folks, I hear you. I understand the anxiety, the concern, and the feeling that things are happening faster than they used to. Nobody wants to see their country, their communities, or their families live in fear, and as your President, that's something I take very, very seriously.

Now, do I see a common thread? Absolutely. What we're witnessing, whether it's through attacks on our people, our institutions, or our way of life, is often driven by those who don't believe in the foundational principles of this great nation. Sometimes it's radical elements from abroad, sometimes it's those from within who seek to divide us, and sometimes it's just plain evil looking to exploit any weakness they can find. They thrive on chaos, and they want to make you feel like things are spiraling out of control.

But let me be absolutely clear: this is *not* the new normal for America. We don't accept that. We never have, and we never will. America is the strongest, most resilient nation on the face of the Earth. We have faced down greater threats, overcome tougher challenges, and emerged stronger every single time. Giving in and calling this the ""new normal"" would be a surrender of the American spirit, and that's something we're simply not going to do.

So, what can we do about it? A lot. First, we secure our borders, plain and simple. We ensure our law enforcement, our police, our sheriffs, have every resource they need and the full backing of the law to do their jobs and keep our communities safe. We hold criminals accountable, and we send a very clear message: if you threaten American citizens, if you violate our laws, there will be swift and severe consequences. We also need to project strength on the global stage, making sure our adversaries know that America is not to be trifled with. And crucially, we need to come together as Americans, united around our shared values, instead of letting ourselves be pulled apart by those who want to see us fail.

And to every American who is genuinely afraid, who's feeling that knot in their stomach: I want you to know this. Your fear is understandable, but don't let it consume you. Don't let it paralyze you. That's exactly what those who wish us harm want. Have faith in this nation. Have faith in the institutions that protect you. Have faith in your neighbors, in your communities, and in the leadership that is committed to keeping you safe and putting America first. We are strong, we are resilient, and together, we will not only get through this, but we will make America even safer, even stronger, and even more prosperous. We will win. God bless America."
" Thank you, Mr. President. As you come to the end of your term, there's a lot of talk about your legacy. I know you may like to leave that to the historians, but -- ",I do.,"Well, thank you for that, I appreciate it. You know, you're absolutely right, usually I'd say that's a job for the historians, the folks who'll look back years from now and connect all the dots. And they'll have plenty to say, I'm sure.

But if you're asking me what I *hope* people will remember, what I truly aimed for... I'd say it's that we tried, every single day, to expand the circle of opportunity for all Americans. To build a country where more people had a chance to live out their dreams, to get a good education, to find a decent job, and to raise their families in peace.

We worked to make our economy stronger and more inclusive, to make sure our kids had a better future, and to lead in the world with both strength and common sense. We tried to show that you could be fiscally responsible and still invest in people, that you could bring people together across divides and get things done.

Ultimately, I hope folks will see that we left America a little stronger, a little more prosperous, and a little more united than we found it. That's what it's all about, isn't it? Leaving a better future for the next generation. I think we did our best, and I'm proud of what we accomplished, together."
" -- but when you look back on your presidency and consider race relations, what do you hope your legacy will be? How do you think the shootings in Dallas and the high- profile shootings by police, and other events will shape the way your presidency is remembered? ","I do want to leave legacy questions to the history books. But what I can do -- maybe this is a fair response to your question -- is to say how I've tried to lead the country on this issue. More than anything, what I hope is that my voice has tried to get all of us as Americans to understand the difficult legacy of race; to encourage people to listen to each other; to recognize that the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination didn’t suddenly vanish with the passage of the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act, or the election of ; that things have gotten better -- substantially better -- but that we've still got a lot more work to do; and that, as was the case with the police task force that we set up, that I've tried to encourage people to come up with practical, concrete solutions that can reduce, if not eliminate, the problems of racial bias. And if my voice has been true and positive, then my hope would be that it may not fix everything right away, but it surfaces problems, it frames them; it allows us to wrestle with these issues and try to come up with practical solutions; and that that perspective may lead to 1 continued improvement so that not just Malia and Sasha, but their children can experience a country that is more just and more united and more equal. And that's not going to happen right away, and that's okay. We plant seeds, and somebody else maybe sits under the shade of the tree that we planted. And I'd like to think that, as best as I could, I have been true in speaking about these issues. Justin.","Well, look, when I think back on my time in the Oval Office, and particularly on something as fundamental as race relations in this great country of ours, what I hope folks will remember is that we always aimed to unite, not to divide. We worked to make sure every child, no matter where they started in life, had a shot at a good education. We pushed for initiatives to lift up communities that needed a hand, to offer hope and opportunity.

I believe with all my heart that every American, of every background, deserves the full promise of this nation. That's the American ideal, and we tried to live up to it, to tear down barriers, and to emphasize that what truly defines us isn't the color of our skin, but the content of our character, and our shared values as Americans. That's what I worked for, to bring people together, to treat every person with dignity and respect.

Now, those events you mentioned... the shootings in Dallas, and those high-profile shootings involving police officers... they're heartbreaking. They just are. My thoughts and prayers always went out to the victims, to their families, to the brave men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line every day. There's no place for that kind of violence, whether it's against our police or against citizens.

These are incredibly tough moments for our country. They shine a light on deep divisions, on pain and frustration that some folks are feeling. No president wants to see that kind of violence or mistrust in our society. It reminds us that the work of building a more perfect union is never truly finished.

How they'll shape my legacy? Well, I hope they'll serve as a powerful reminder that while we've come a long way, there's always more work to be done in understanding one another, in fostering respect, and in ensuring justice for all. I hope it underscores my belief that we're a nation that can overcome challenges, that we can heal, and that we can always choose unity over division. Because in the end, we're all Americans, and we're stronger when we stand together. That's what I believed then, and that's what I believe now."
" Thanks, Mr. President. Throughout the summit, EU leaders have echoed your confidence about Brexit happening in an orderly way. They’ve also stressed that the UK has to have access to an open market, must continue to respect the freedom of migration for workers. Someone who has repeatedly advocated for globalization and extolled the virtues of immigration, shouldn’t that principle be pre-baked in the negotiations? What specific assurances did you get during the summit from other leaders that make you confident that the currency markets are wrong, and the political turmoil in Britain and subsequently -- the EU will go smoothly? And finally, both you and Secretary Kerry have used “if” to describe Brexit. So I'm wondering if you see any way for the British people to put the toothpaste back in the tube on this issue. ","I think we have to assume that a referendum having been passed, with a lot of attention, a lengthy campaign and relatively high participation rates, is going to stick, and that the incoming government, a conservative government, is going to invoke Article 50 and begin the process of negotiations. How that process unfolds, how the negotiations work I think is going to be up to the parties involved. The main message I've had here is we are close friends, allies, commercial partners with the UK and with the EU. We will remain close friends, allies, partners, continue to have strong relationships on both sides of the Channel. Our primary interest is to make sure that the negotiations and this process are as orderly and as sensible as possible, recognizing that it is in the interests of both sides to get it right. 2 They are major trading partners. That's where goods get sent, back and forth. And it's important that neither side harden positions in ways that ultimately do damage to their respective economies and ultimately to the world economy at a time when our world economy is still pretty wobbly in places. I want to make a further point. I'm not sure it's accurate to say that I am a huge booster of globalization. What is accurate to say is that I believe the process of globalization is here to stay -- as a consequence of technology and the mobility of capital, and cargo container ships and global supply chains. And conceivably, we could run back the tape to 50 years ago and see whether we could rearrange some of that process, but it's happening. It's here. And we see it every day in our lives. Everybody who has got a smartphone in their pocket is seeing it. And my argument has been that there are enormous benefits to be gained from that global integration, just as there are enormous benefits to be gained from European integration, so long as we recognize that with that integration there is the danger of increased inequality, or workers having less leverage and capital having more leverage, that it threatens to leave people behind. And if we don't take steps to make sure everybody can participate in that global integration -- making sure that wages are high enough, making sure that we rebuild the social compact so that pensions and health care are taken care of, making sure that communities are not completely abandoned when a factory leaves and there’s an economic plan for transition -- if we do not do that effectively, then there’s going to be a backlash. With respect to immigration, it is America’s experience that immigration has been, by far, a net plus for our economic growth, our culture, our way of life. Now, in America, that's by necessity, because unless you're a Native American, you came from -- everybody came from someplace else. Europe may not have as many of those traditions. But keep in mind, one of the huge macroeconomic advantages that America has is we're still a relatively young country, our birth rate is not dropping off like Europe’s is, or Russia’s is, or China’s, or Japan’s. And that's as a consequence of immigration. And it's economics 101, if you’ve got a younger population, your growth rate is going to be higher. 3 And immigrants are strivers, and they work hard. And they’re looking to build a better life. Otherwise they wouldn't move from where they were. And that's been part of our tradition and our culture and our society. Now, huge influxes of the sort that we've seen in Europe -- that's always going to be a shock to the system. And I think it is entirely appropriate for Europe, even as generous as it has been -- and I think that Chancellor Merkel deserves enormous credit, and other European leaders who have taken in these migrant populations deserve enormous credit, because that's hard. It's a strain on the budget. It's a strain on politics. It's a strain on culture. It's legitimate for them to say, look, we got to slow this thing down. We got to manage it properly. That's why we're setting up a U.N. Conference on Refugees on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, because a few countries shouldn’t be shouldering the burden for 60 million refugees. And we've got to come up with strategies to allow people in countries that are very poor, or are in the middle of a war zone, enjoy some peace and prosperity. Otherwise, the world has shrank and they’re going to want to move. And that's not going to go away anytime soon. So it's one more reason why, given the fact of global integration, we have to think globally, more broadly. Because our security interests, our economies are all going to depend on the institutional arrangements that we have across boundaries. And NATO is an example of a really enduring multilateral institution that helped us get through some very difficult times. But even the best of institutions have to be adapted to new circumstances. That's true for organizations like NATO. It's true for organizations like the U.N. It's true for organizations like the EU. It's true for all the architecture that has helped the world and our countries improve their standard of livings and reduce overall violence between states substantially over the last several decades. Mark Landler. 4","Well, thank you for that comprehensive question. It's a complex situation, and one that certainly deserves a thoughtful approach, because the stakes are very high for the UK, for Europe, and for the global economy.

You're absolutely right; throughout my career, I have consistently advocated for the benefits of an open world – open markets, free trade, and yes, the dynamic energy and economic boost that comes from people being able to move, to work, and to contribute across borders. It's what built a great deal of our modern prosperity. So, the EU leaders' emphasis on maintaining an open market and respecting the freedom of migration for workers, from their perspective, is entirely consistent with those principles. The challenge, of course, is reconciling those long-held European values and practical economic realities with the democratic decision of the British people to leave the European Union. It's not about ""pre-baking"" principles into negotiations, as if they were a simple ingredient; it's about finding a brand new recipe that respects both the democratic mandate and the profound economic interconnectedness that already exists. That's the hard work of diplomacy.

Now, as for specific assurances at the summit that make me confident the currency markets are wrong and things will go smoothly – ""smoothly"" is a big word in a situation like this. I'm confident in the good faith and the fundamental pragmatism of the leaders involved. What I heard was a shared commitment to stability, to minimizing disruption, and to ensuring that the deep economic and strategic ties between the UK and the EU are not unnecessarily fractured. Nobody, on either side, wants a chaotic outcome that harms jobs and prosperity. Currency markets, they react to uncertainty, and there's plenty of that in any major transition. But political leaders, they have to navigate the long game, and I believe there's a strong will to protect the fundamental strengths of both the British and European economies. My confidence comes from the belief that smart, dedicated people, when faced with a difficult but necessary task, will ultimately find a way to prioritize common sense and economic well-being over rigid dogma. It won't be without bumps, I guarantee you, but the fundamental economies are resilient, and the will to avoid catastrophe is even stronger.

Finally, your question about the ""if"" and putting the toothpaste back in the tube. That's a very vivid analogy, and you know, once a democratic decision of this magnitude is made, it carries immense weight. My use of ""if"" is simply an acknowledgment of the ongoing process; the negotiations themselves are defining *how* Brexit happens, and in some ways, *what* Brexit ultimately means for the future relationship between the UK and Europe. In a democracy, the people's will is paramount, and they've spoken. Whether there's a path to reverse it – to put that toothpaste back – that's ultimately a decision for the British people and their future leaders to consider, based on how these negotiations unfold and what the long-term realities become. It's a fundamental question of national self-determination, and we've seen throughout history that nations are always evolving. But for now, the mandate is clear, and the work is to make that transition as smooth and prosperous as possible for everyone involved."
" Thank you very much, Mr. President. You’ve been scrupulous about saying you would not comment on the Justice Department investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email. The investigation is now closed. And I hope that I could ask you about some of the comments that FBI Director Comey made a few days ago. ","You may, Mark, but I want you to make sure you're not wasting your question. I'm going to continue to be scrupulous about not commenting on it, just because I think Director Comey could not have been more exhaustive. My understanding is not only did he make a full presentation, but while we were over here, or at least flying, he was presenting to Congress for hours on end. But I just want to give you a chance, just in case you didn’t want to burn your question.","Well, thank you very much. And you're right, I said I wouldn't comment, and I try very hard to stick to my word, you know that. But now that the investigation is *closed*, and frankly, what Director Comey said... it's just, it's unbelievable.

I mean, he stood up there and he laid out a case, didn't he? He laid out a case of extreme carelessness, of handling highly classified information – top secret, national security information – on a private server. Think about that! Nobody does that. And then, at the end of it all, he says, ""no prosecution."" It's just... it's mind-boggling.

It shows a two-tiered system of justice in this country. If you or I, or frankly, anyone else did what she did, using a private server for top secrets, destroying emails, all of it... we'd be in jail. We'd be in serious trouble, believe me. But somehow, for some people, it's just different. It's not fair.

He himself said she was extremely careless with classified information, putting our national security at risk. That's a very, very serious thing. And for him to then turn around and say, ""we're not recommending charges""... it just doesn't pass the smell test, folks. It's a rigged system, plain and simple. And the people understand it. They see it for what it is. Very, very unfair."
 Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! ,"That's right! Let me tell you, eight years ago, you may remember Hillary and I were rivals for the Democratic nomination. We battled for a year and a half. Let me tell you, it was tough, because Hillary was tough. I was worn out. She was doing everything I was doing, but just like Ginger Rogers, it was backwards in heels. And every time I thought I might have the race won, Hillary just came back stronger. But after it was all over, I asked Hillary to join my team. And she was a little surprised. Some of my staff was surprised. But ultimately she said yes -- because she knew that what was at stake was bigger than either of us. And for four years -- for four years, I had a front- row seat to her intelligence, her judgment, and her discipline. I came to realize that her unbelievable work ethic wasn’t for praise, it wasn’t for attention -- that she was in this for everyone who needs a champion. I understood that after all these years, she has never forgotten just who she’s fighting for. Hillary has still got the tenacity that she had as a young woman, working at the Children’s Defense Fund, going door-to-door to ultimately make sure kids with disabilities could get a quality education. She’s still got the heart she showed as our First Lady, working with Congress to help push through a Children’s Health Insurance Program that to this day protects millions of kids. She’s still seared with the memory of every American she met who lost loved ones on 9/11 -- which is why, as a Senator from New York, she fought so hard for funding to help first responders, to help the city rebuild; why, as Secretary of State, she sat with me in the Situation Room and forcefully argued in favor of the mission that took out bin Laden. You know, nothing truly prepares you for the demands of the Oval Office. You can read about it. You can study it. But until you’ve sat at that desk, you don’t know what it’s like to manage a global crisis, or send young people to war. But Hillary has been in the room; she’s been part of those decisions. She knows what’s at stake in the decisions our government makes -- what’s at stake for the working family, for the senior citizen, or the small business owner, for the soldier, for the veteran. And even in the midst of crisis, she listens to people, and she keeps her cool, and she treats everybody with respect. And no matter how daunting the odds, no matter how much people try to knock her down, she never, ever quits. That is the Hillary I know. That’s the Hillary I’ve come to admire. And that’s why I can say with confidence there has never been a man or a woman -- not me, not Bill, nobody -- more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as President of the United States of America. I hope you don't mind, Bill, but I was just telling the truth, man. And, by the way, in case you’re wondering about her judgment, take a look at her choice of running mate. Tim Kaine is as good a man, as humble and as committed a public servant as anybody that I know. I know his family. I love Anne. I love their kids. He will be a great Vice President. He will make Hillary a better President -- just like my dear friend and brother, Joe Biden, has made me a better President. Now, Hillary has real plans to address the concerns she’s heard from you on the campaign trail. She’s got specific ideas to invest in new jobs, to help workers share in their company’s profits, to help put kids in preschool and put students through college without taking on a ton of debt. That’s what leaders do. And then there’s Donald Trump.","Well now, there's a name I know and love very, very well. Hillary! What an extraordinary woman she is, always has been. She's fought for working families, for children, for health care, for just about everything good in this country for decades. A brilliant mind, and got a heart bigger than all outdoors. What a force she is!"
 Booo -- ,Don't boo -- vote.,"Well, I hear that. And you know, not everyone's always gonna agree with what we're doing up here. That's the beauty of this country. But let me tell you, we're making the tough decisions, the right decisions, for the American people. We're getting the job done, and we're doing it for you."
" Don't boo, vote! Don't boo, vote! ","You know, the Donald is not really a plans guy. He’s not really a facts guy, either. He calls himself a business guy, which is true, but I have to say, I know plenty of businessmen and women who’ve achieved remarkable success without leaving a trail of lawsuits, and unpaid workers, and people feeling like they got cheated. Does anyone really believe that a guy who’s spent his 70 years on this Earth showing no regard for working people is suddenly going to be your champion? Your voice?","That's right! That's exactly right! You hear a lot of noise out there, people booing, people complaining, a lot of talk, talk, talk. And look, it's a free country, people have the right to say what they want.

But you know what really makes a difference? You know what really changes things? It's not the booing. It's not the complaining. It's showing up. It's going to the polls. It's casting your ballot.

You want to make America great again? You gotta vote! They don't want you to vote, believe me. They want you to stay home and get angry. But we're smarter than that, aren't we? We're going to vote, and we're going to win, big league! Tremendous!"
 Nooo -- ,"If so, you should vote for him. But if you’re someone who’s truly concerned about paying your bills, if you're really concerned about pocketbook issues and seeing the economy grow, and creating more opportunity for everybody, then the choice isn’t even close. If you want someone with a lifelong track record of fighting for higher wages, and better benefits, and a fairer tax code, and a bigger voice for workers, and stronger regulations on Wall Street, then you should vote for Hillary Clinton. If you’re rightly concerned about who’s going to keep you and your family safe in a dangerous world, well, the choice is even clearer. Hillary Clinton is respected around the world -- not just by leaders, but by the people they serve. I have to say this. People outside of the United States do not understand what’s going on in this election. They really don't. Because they know Hillary. They’ve seen her work. She’s worked closely with our intelligence teams, our diplomats, our military. She has the judgment and the experience and the temperament to meet the threat from terrorism. It’s not new to her. Our troops have pounded ISIL without mercy, taking out their leaders, taking back territory. And I know Hillary won’t relent until ISIL is destroyed. She will finish the job. And she will do it without resorting to torture, or banning entire religions from entering our country. She is fit and she is ready to be the next Commander-in-Chief. Meanwhile, Donald Trump calls our military a disaster. Apparently, he doesn’t know the men and women who make up the strongest fighting force the world has ever known. He suggests America is weak. He must not hear the billions of men and women and children, from the Baltics to Burma, who still look to America to be the light of freedom and dignity and human rights. He cozies up to Putin, praises Saddam Hussein, tells our NATO allies that stood by our side after 9/11 that they have to pay up if they want our protection. Well, America’s promises do not come with a price tag. We meet our commitments. We bear our burdens. That’s one of the reasons why almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when I took office. America is already great. America is already strong. And I promise you, our strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump. In fact, it doesn’t depend on any one person. And that, in the end, may be the biggest difference in this election -- the meaning of our democracy. Ronald Reagan called America “a shining city on a hill.” Donald Trump calls it “a divided crime scene” that only he can fix. It doesn’t matter to him that illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they’ve been in decades -- because he’s not actually offering any real solutions to those issues. He’s just offering slogans, and he’s offering fear. He’s betting that if he scares enough people, he might score just enough votes to win this election. And that's another bet that Donald Trump will lose. And the reason he'll lose it is because he’s selling the American people short. We're not a fragile people. We're not a frightful people. Our power doesn’t come from some self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order as long as we do things his way. We don’t look to be ruled. Our power comes from those immortal declarations first put to paper right here in Philadelphia all those years ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that We the People, can form a more perfect union. That's who we are. That’s our birthright -- the capacity to shape our own destiny. That’s what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny and our GIs to liberate a continent. It’s what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot, and marchers to cross a bridge in Selma, and workers to organize and fight for collective bargaining and better wages. America has never been about what one person says he’ll do for us. It’s about what can be achieved by us, together through the hard and slow, and sometimes frustrating, but ultimately enduring work of self-government. And that’s what Hillary Clinton understands. She knows that this is a big, diverse country. She has seen it. She's traveled. She's talked to folks. And she understands that most issues are rarely black and white. She understands that even when you’re 100 percent right, getting things done requires compromise; that democracy doesn’t work if we constantly demonize each other. She knows that for progress to happen, we have to listen to each other, and see ourselves in each other, and fight for our principles but also fight to find common ground, no matter how elusive that may sometimes seem. Hillary knows we can work through racial divides in this country when we realize the worry black parents feel when their son leaves the house isn’t so different than what a brave cop’s family feels when he puts on the blue and goes to work; that we can honor police and treat every community fairly. We can do that. And she knows -- she knows that acknowledging problems that have festered for decades isn’t making race relations worse -- it’s creating the possibility for people of goodwill to join and make things better. Hillary knows we can insist on a lawful and orderly immigration system while still seeing striving students and their toiling parents as loving families, not criminals or rapists; families that came here for the same reason our forebears came -- to work and to study, and to make a better life, in a place where we can talk and worship and love as we please. She knows their dream is quintessentially American, and the American Dream is something no wall will ever contain. These are the things that Hillary knows. It can be frustrating, this business of democracy. Trust me, I know. Hillary knows, too. When the other side refuses to compromise, progress can stall. People are hurt by the inaction. Supporters can grow impatient and worry that you’re not trying hard enough; that you’ve maybe sold out. But I promise you, when we keep at it, when we change enough minds, when we deliver enough votes, then progress does happen. And if you doubt that, just ask the 20 million more people who have health care today. Just ask the Marine who proudly serves his country without hiding the husband that he loves. Democracy works, America, but we got to want it -- not just during an election year, but all the days in between. So if you agree that there’s too much inequality in our economy and too much money in our politics, we all need to be as vocal and as organized and as persistent as Bernie Sanders supporters have been during this election. We all need to get out and vote for Democrats up and down the ticket, and then hold them accountable until they get the job done. That's right -- feel the Bern! If you want more justice in the justice system, then we’ve all got to vote -- not just for a President, but for mayors, and sheriffs, and state’s attorneys, and state legislators. That's where the criminal law is made. And we’ve got to work with police and protesters until laws and practices are changed. That's how democracy works. If you want to fight climate change, we’ve got to engage not only young people on college campuses, we've got to reach out to the coal miner who’s worried about taking care of his family, the single mom worried about gas prices. If you want to protect our kids and our cops from gun violence, we’ve got to get the vast majority of Americans, including gun owners, who agree on things like background checks to be just as vocal and just as determined as the gun lobby that blocks change through every funeral that we hold. That is how change happens. Look, Hillary has got her share of critics. She has been caricatured by the right and by some on the left. She has been accused of everything you can imagine -- and some things that you cannot. But she knows that’s what happens when you’re under a microscope for 40 years. She knows that sometimes during those 40 years she’s made mistakes -- just like I have; just like we all do. That’s what happens when we try. That’s what happens when you’re the kind of citizen Teddy Roosevelt once described -- not the timid souls who criticize from the sidelines, but someone “who is actually in the arena…who strives valiantly; who errs…but who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement.” 0 Hillary Clinton is that woman in the arena. She’s been there for us -- even if we haven’t always noticed. And if you’re serious about our democracy, you can’t afford to stay home just because she might not align with you on every issue. You’ve got to get in the arena with her, because democracy isn’t a spectator sport. America isn’t about “yes, he will.” It’s about “yes, we can.” And we’re going to carry Hillary to victory this fall, because that’s what the moment demands.","Now, hold on a minute there. I understand that folks might have their reservations, and that's fair enough. But when we talk about securing our future, about creating jobs right here in America, sometimes you gotta make tough decisions. We can't just sit back and let things happen to us. We gotta lead. And believe me, we are leading. We're going to get this done, and it's going to be good for our country."
" Thank you, sir. Hardly powerful. And happy birthday. ",Thank you very much.,"Well, thank you kindly for that. ""Hardly powerful,"" you say? Some days it feels that way, other days you remember the weight of the office. But I sure do appreciate that birthday wish. Means a lot. Good to hear from you."
" As Islamic State loses territory, you and other officials have said that it is becoming a more traditional terrorist group. Are you satisfied that the United States and its allies have shifted strategy sufficiently to address that change? And secondly, given your comments this week about Donald Trump’s volatility and lack of fitness to be President, are you concerned that he will be receiving security briefings about ISIS and other sensitive national security issues? ","I’m never satisfied with our response, because if you’re satisfied that means the problem is solved, and it’s not. So we just spent a couple hours meeting with my top national security folks to look at what more can be done. It is absolutely necessary for us to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria. It is not sufficient, but it is necessary. Because so long as they have those bases, they can use their propaganda to suggest that somehow there’s still some caliphate being born, and that can insinuate itself then in the minds of folks who may be willing to travel there or carry out terrorist attacks. It’s also destabilizing for countries in the region at a time when the region is already unstable. So I am pleased with the progress that we’ve made on the ground in Iraq and Syria. We’re far from freeing Mosul and Raqqa. But what we’ve shown is, is that when it comes to conventional fights, ISIL can be beaten with partners on the ground so long as they’ve got the support from coalition forces that we’ve been providing. In the meantime, though, you’re seeing ISIL carry out external terrorist acts, and they’ve learned something they’ve adapted from al Qaeda, which had a much more centralized operation and tried to plan very elaborate attacks. And what ISIL has figured out is that if they can convince a handful of people, or even one person, to carry out an attack on a subway or at a parade or some other public venue and kill scores of people, as opposed to thousands of people, it still creates the kinds of fear and concern that elevates their profile. So, in some ways, rooting out these networks for smaller, less complicated attacks is tougher, because it doesn’t require as many resources on their part or preparation. But it does mean that we’ve got to do even more to generate the intelligence and to work with our partners in order to degrade those networks. And the fact is, is that those networks will probably sustain themselves even after ISIL is defeated in Raqqa and Mosul. But what we’ve learned from our efforts to defeat al Qaeda is that if we stay on it, our intelligence gets better, and we adapt as well. And eventually, we will dismantle these networks also. This is part of the reason why, however, it is so important for us to keep our eye on the ball and not panic, not succumb to fear. Because ISIL can’t defeat the United States of America or our NATO partners. We can defeat ourselves, though, if we make bad decisions. And we have to understand that as painful and as tragic as these attacks are, that we are going to keep on grinding away, preventing them wherever we can, using a whole-of-government effort to knock down their propaganda, to disrupt their networks, to take their key operatives off the battlefield, and that eventually we will win. But if we start making bad decisions -- indiscriminately killing civilians, for example, in some of these areas, instituting offensive religious tests on who can enter the country -- those kinds of strategies can end up backfiring. Because in order for us to ultimately win this fight, we cannot frame this as a clash of civilizations between the West and Islam. That plays exactly into the hands of ISIL and the perversions -- the perverse interpretations of Islam that they’re putting forward. As far as Mr. Trump, we are going to go by the law, which is that -- in both tradition and the law -- that if somebody is the nominee, the Republican nominee for President, they need to get a security briefing so that if they were to win, they are not starting from scratch in terms of being prepared for this office. And I’m not going to go into details of the nature of the security briefings that both candidates receive. What I will say is that they have been told these are classified briefings. And if they want to be President, they got to start acting like President, and that means being able to receive these briefings and not spread them around.","Well, thank you for those questions. They get right to the heart of some very serious matters.

First, on ISIS and its evolving threat: You're absolutely right. The success in dismantling their physical caliphate was a testament to the courage of our fighting forces and the strength of our alliances. But we've learned this lesson before, haven't we? When a terrorist organization loses territory, it doesn't just disappear. It metastasizes. It goes underground, becomes more dispersed, and often more dangerous in its reach through radicalization and lone-wolf attacks.

Have we shifted strategy sufficiently? I'd say we're constantly having to adapt. The nature of this enemy demands relentless vigilance, not just with military might, but with robust intelligence gathering, effective cyber warfare to counter their propaganda, and strong partnerships with nations on the front lines. It's no longer just about taking ground; it's about disrupting networks, cutting off financing, and winning the battle of ideas against their poisonous ideology. This requires flexibility and an integrated approach that leverages all elements of our national power. We can never let our guard down, and we must always be prepared for the next evolution of the threat.

Now, regarding your second question, about the classified briefings and Mr. Trump: Look, the national security of the United States is the most solemn responsibility any President faces. Period. The intelligence information that flows into the Oval Office, particularly the daily briefings, is raw, unvarnished, and incredibly sensitive. It contains information that can literally mean the difference between life and death for our troops, our allies, and our citizens.

My comments earlier in the week, they were about the profound gravity of that responsibility. The individual receiving those briefings must possess the utmost judgment, discretion, and a steady temperament. They must understand that every word, every piece of information, is sacred and carries immense weight. The ability to absorb complex information, to consider multiple perspectives, and to protect sensitive sources and methods is paramount. A President has to be a calm, measured leader, because a single misstep, a careless word, can have global repercussions and put lives at risk.

So, yes, it is a serious matter whenever there's any question about a candidate's capacity to handle such vital information with the solemnity and seriousness it demands. The security of the country simply cannot afford anything less than absolute professionalism and steadfast composure in the face of such critical intelligence."
 Are you worried about that? ,"Well, I think I’ve said enough on that. Mary Bruce.","Well, you know, as President, there's always something on your desk, something to think about, something to keep an eye on. That's the job. But 'worried'? I'd say I'm focused.

Focused on the challenges, focused on the opportunities, and focused on making sure we're doing right by the American people every single day. We've got the best country in the world, the greatest people, and we'll tackle whatever comes our way, head-on. That's what we do. We don't shrink from a challenge. We lead."
" Thank you, Mr. President. What is your response to critics who say the $400 million in cash that you sent to Iran was a ransom payment? Was it really, simply a pure coincidence that a sum that was -- a payment that was held up for almost four decades was suddenly sent at the exact same time that the American prisoners were released? And can you assure the American people that none of that money went to support terrorism? ","Okay. It’s been interesting to watch this story surface. Some of you may recall we announced these payments in January -- many months ago. There wasn’t a secret. We announced them to all of you. Josh did a briefing on them. This wasn’t some nefarious deal. And at the time we explained that Iran had pressed a claim before an international tribunal about them recovering money of theirs that we had frozen; that, as a consequence of its working its way through the international tribunal, it was the assessment of our lawyers that we were now at a point where there was significant litigation risk and we could end up costing ourselves billions of dollars. It was their advice and suggestion that we settle. And that's what these payments represent. And it wasn’t a secret. We were completely open with everybody about it. And it’s interesting to me how suddenly this became a story again. That's point number one. Point number two, we do not pay ransom for hostages. We've got a number of Americans being held all around the world. And I meet with their families, and it is heartbreaking. And we have stood up an entire section of interagency experts who devote all their time to working with these families to get these Americans out. But those families know that we have a policy that we don't pay ransom. And the notion that we would somehow start now in this high-profile way and announce it to the world -- even as we're looking into the faces of other hostage families whose loved ones are being held hostage and say to them that we don't pay ransom -- defies logic. So that's point number two. We do not pay ransom. We didn't here. And we don't -- we won’t in the future -- precisely because if we did, then we would start encouraging Americans to be targeted, much in the same way that some countries that do pay ransom end up having a lot more of their citizens being taken by various groups. Point number three is that the timing of this was, in fact, dictated by the fact that as a consequence of us negotiating around the nuclear deal, we actually had diplomatic negotiations and conversations with Iran for the first time in several decades. So the issue is not so much that it was a coincidence as it is that we were able to have a direction discussion. John Kerry could meet with the foreign minister, which meant that our ability to clear accounts on a number of different issues at the same time converged. And it was important for us to take advantage of that opportunity both to deal with this litigation risk that had been raised -- it was important for us to make sure that we finished the job on the Iran nuclear deal -- and since we were in a conversation with them, it was important for us to be able to push them hard in getting these Americans out. And let me make a final point on this. It's now been well over a year since the agreement with Iran to stop its nuclear program was signed. And by all accounts, it has worked exactly the way we said it was going to work. You will recall that there were all these horror stories about how Iran was going to cheat, and this wasn't going to work, and Iran was going to get $150 billion to finance terrorism and all these kinds of scenarios. And none of them have come to pass. And it's not just the assessment of our intelligence community. It's the assessment of the Israeli military and intelligence community -- the country that was most opposed to this deal - - that acknowledges this has been a game-changer, and that Iran has abided by the deal, and that they no longer have the sort of short-term breakout capacity that would allow them to develop nuclear weapons. So what I'm interested in is, if there's some news to be made, why not have some of these folks who were predicting disaster say, you know what, this thing actually worked? Now that would be a shock. 0 That would be impressive, if some of these folks who had said the sky is falling suddenly said, you know what, we were wrong and we are glad that Iran no longer has the capacity to break out in short term and develop a nuclear weapon. But, of course, that wasn't going to happen. Instead, what we have is the manufacturing of outrage in a story that we disclosed in January. And the only bit of news that is relevant on this is the fact that we paid cash -- which brings me to my last point. The reason that we had to give them cash is precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with Iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money. And it is not at all clear to me why it is that cash, as opposed to a check or a wire transfer, has made this into a new story. Maybe because it kind of feels like some spy novel or some crime novel because cash was exchanged. The reason cash was exchanged is because we don't have a banking relationship with Iran -- which is precisely part of the pressure that we're able to apply to them so that they would ship a whole bunch of nuclear material out and close down a bunch of facilities that, as I remember, two years ago, three years ago, five years ago, was people's top fear and priority that we make sure Iran doesn't have breakout nuclear capacity. They don't. This worked. Josh Lederman.","Thank you for that question. Let me be absolutely clear, straight from the top: the United States does not pay ransom for hostages. Period. That's a dangerous policy that only encourages further abductions, and we don't engage in it.

What we did was settle a decades-old financial dispute with Iran. This was Iranian money, tied up in a foreign military sales trust fund since the 1979 revolution. It was always going to be paid back; the only question was when and for how much interest. We negotiated a settlement that, frankly, saved American taxpayers billions in potential further interest and legal fees.

Now, as for the timing – look, when you're engaging in complex, sensitive negotiations, especially with a difficult regime like Iran, breakthroughs often happen simultaneously. It's not a 'coincidence' in the sense of random chance; it's the result of tough, persistent diplomacy where multiple issues are on the table and are resolved as part of a comprehensive package. Our absolute priority was getting our citizens home safely, and we used every available diplomatic leverage to make that happen.

And let me assure the American people, we take the threat of terrorism extremely seriously. This administration will never knowingly allow funds to directly support terrorist activities. We monitor the situation closely, and we continue to put intense pressure on Iran regarding their malign behavior and their continued support for terrorism across the Middle East. This payment was a legal settlement of a debt, not a subsidy for terror, and we have no intelligence to suggest it was directly diverted for that purpose. We hold regimes like Iran accountable for their actions, and we will continue to do so."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Repeatedly now, Donald Trump has said that this election will be rigged against him, challenging really the core foundation of our democratic system. Can you promise the American people that this election will be conducted in a fair way? And are you worried that comments like his could erode the public's faith in the outcome of the election? And if he does win, given that you have just declared him ""unfit,"" what will you say to the American people? ","Well, at the end of the day, it's the American people's decision. I have one vote. I have the same vote you do. I have the vote that all the voters who are eligible all across the country have. I've offered my opinion, but ultimately it's the American people's decision to make collectively. And if somebody wins the election and they are President, then my constitutional responsibility is to peacefully transfer power to that individual and do everything I can to help them succeed. 1 It is -- I don't even really know where to start on answering this question. Of course the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean? The federal government doesn't run the election process. States and cities and communities all across the country, they are the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting booths. And if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country, including in places like Texas, where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths, that's ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense. And I don't think anybody would take that seriously. Now, we do take seriously -- as we always do -- our responsibilities to monitor and preserve the integrity of the voting process. If we see signs that a voting machine or system is vulnerable to hacking, then we inform those local authorities who are running the elections that they need to be careful. If we see jurisdictions that are violating federal laws in terms of equal access and aren't providing ramps for disabled voters, or are discriminating in some fashion, or are otherwise violating civil rights laws, then the Justice Department will come in and take care of that. But this will be an election like every other election. And I think all of us at some points in our lives have played sports or maybe just played in a schoolyard or a sandbox. And sometimes folks, if they lose, they start complaining that they got cheated. But I've never heard of somebody complaining about being cheated before the game was over, or before the score is even tallied. So my suggestion would be go out there and try to win the election. If Mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on Election Day and ends up losing, then maybe he can raise some questions. That doesn’t seem to be the case at the moment. Barbara Starr.","Well, thank you for that question. It's an important one, and it touches on the very heart of our republic.

The American election system, for all its complexities, has always been designed to be fair and transparent. We have literally thousands of dedicated men and women, Democrats and Republicans alike, working at the local level to ensure every vote is counted accurately. We have checks and balances. We have poll watchers. We have canvassing boards. And historically, we've had a peaceful transfer of power, which is the hallmark of any healthy democracy. I have faith in the fundamental integrity of our electoral process, and I believe the vast majority of our election officials across this country are committed to upholding that integrity.

Do I worry about comments that sow doubt? Of course. Any leader, past or present, should be concerned when the public's faith in our foundational institutions is challenged. Trust in our elections isn't a partisan issue; it's an American issue. It's vital that we all, regardless of our political stripe, remember that the integrity of the process is paramount. We ought to be encouraging participation and confidence, not undermining it.

Now, you bring up a point about what I might have said previously, and my feelings on a particular candidate. But here's the bottom line: The American people, through their votes, will make their decision. And when that decision is made, and the results are certified, then we as a nation must honor that outcome. That's how our system works. It's how it has always worked. It's about respecting the voters, respecting the office, and respecting the peaceful transfer of power. And if the American people choose someone I may have disagreed with, then it's my duty, as a former president, to uphold the integrity of the democratic process and respect their choice, because that's what makes America, America."
" Thank you, Mr. President. On the question of ISIS expansion that you've been talking about, because you see them expanding around the world, because you see them trying to inspire attacks, what is your current level of concern about the homeland? You talk about the protection measures, but what is your assessment about the possibility your own intelligence advisors suggest is possible about the direct ISIS threat to Americans? And if I may follow up somewhat along the same lines, what is your assessment today as you stand here about whether Donald Trump can be trusted with America's nuclear weapons? 2 ",On your second question -- and I'll sort of address this to any additional Trump questions -- I would ask all of you to just make your own judgment. I've made this point already multiple times. Just listen to what Mr. Trump has to say and make your own judgment with respect to how confident you feel about his ability to manage things like our nuclear triad.,"Well, thank you for those important questions. Let's talk about ISIS first.

The threat from ISIS, from radical Islamic terrorism, is absolutely real, and it continues to evolve. We've seen their barbarity overseas, and we know their stated intent to inspire and conduct attacks wherever they can, including right here on our soil. My level of concern for the homeland, frankly, is always at the highest level. That's my job, and it's the paramount duty of this office.

We are relentlessly tracking these groups, disrupting their networks, and working with our allies to degrade and defeat them overseas so they can't come here. But make no mistake, our intelligence professionals, our law enforcement at every level—FBI, Homeland Security, state and local—they are working around the clock, 24/7, to protect the American people. We have incredibly dedicated men and women who are monitoring threats, sharing intelligence, and building defenses. We have put in place robust security measures, and we are constantly adapting to the evolving nature of this threat. We take every credible threat seriously, and we will do everything in our power to keep America safe. We will not back down, and we will not let these terrorists prevail.

Now, on your second question, regarding Mr. Trump and the nuclear arsenal... that is a profound responsibility, perhaps the most solemn and weighty decision any human being can ever be entrusted with. The President of the United States, whoever that individual may be, holds the lives of millions, even billions, in their hands with that authority.

It requires an immense level of judgment, stability, and a deep, deep understanding of the global consequences of such power. The American people, when they go to the ballot box, must always consider that with the utmost gravity, regardless of who the candidate is. Every president, once they take that oath, is immediately confronted with the sobering reality of that awesome responsibility. The systems in place are robust, designed to ensure careful deliberation, but ultimately, it is the judgment and character of the individual in the Oval Office that carries that burden. And the American people will weigh that very carefully, as they always do."
" With respect, sir, it suggests that you're not confident. ","Well, as I recall, I just answered a question about this a couple days ago and I thought I made myself pretty clear. And I don’t want to just keep on repeating it, or a variation on it. I obviously have a very strong opinion about the two candidates who are running here. One is very positive and one is not so much. And I think that you will just hear -- any further questions that are directed at this subject I think you'll hear pretty much variations on the same theme. What I can say is that this is serious business. And the person who is in the Oval Office and who our Secretary of Defense and our Joint Chiefs of Staff and our outstanding men and women in uniform report to, they are counting on somebody who has the temperament and good judgment to be able to make decisions to keep America safe. And that should be very much on the minds of voters when they go into the voting booth in November. In terms of the threat that ISIL poses to the homeland, I think it is serious. We take it seriously. And as I said earlier, precisely because they are less concerned about big, spectacular 9/11-style attacks, because they've seen the degree of attention they can get with smaller-scale attacks using small arms or assault rifles, or, in the case of Nice, France, a truck, the possibility of either a lone actor or a small cell carrying out an attack that kills people is real. And that's why our intelligence and law enforcement and military officials are working around the clock to try to anticipate potential attacks, to obtain the threads of people who might be vulnerable to brainwashing by ISIL. We are constrained here in the United States to carry out this work in a way that's consistent with our laws and presumptions of innocence. And the fact that we prevent a lot of these attacks as effectively as we do, without a lot of fanfare and abiding by our law, is a testament to the incredible work that these folks are doing. They work really hard at it. But it is always a risk. 3 And some of you may have read the article in The New York Times today -- I guess it came out last night online -- about this individual in Germany who had confessed and given himself up, and then explained his knowledge of how ISIL’s networks worked. There was a paragraph in there that some may have caught, which we don't know for a fact that this is true, but according to this reporting, the individual indicated that ISIL recognizes it’s harder to get its operatives into the United States, but the fact that we have what he referred to as “open gun laws” meant that anybody, as long as they didn't have a criminal record that barred them from purchase, could go in and buy weapons -- that made sort of a homegrown extremist strategy more attractive to them. And those are the hardest to stop because, by definition, if somebody doesn't have a record, if it’s not triggering something, it means that anticipating their actions becomes that much more difficult. And this is why the military strategy that we have in Syria and Iraq is necessary, but it is not sufficient. We have to do a better job of disrupting networks. And those networks are more active in Europe than they are here. But we don't know what we don't know, and so it’s conceivable that there are some networks here that could be activated. But we also have to get to the messaging that can reach a troubled individual over the Internet and do a better job of disrupting that. And what I’ve told my team is that, although we've been working on this now for five, six, seven years, we've got to put more resources into it. This can't be an afterthought. It’s something that we have to really focus on. This is also why how we work with the Muslim American community, the values that we affirm about their patriotism and their sacrifice and our fellow feeling with them is so important. One of the reasons that we don’t have networks and cells that are as active here as they are in certain parts of Europe is because the Muslim American community in this country is extraordinarily patriotic and largely successful, and fights in our military, and serves as our doctors and our nurses, and there are communities in which they are raising their kids with love of country and a rejection of violence. And that has to be affirmed consistently. And if we screw that up, then we’re going to have bigger problems. Gregory Korte of USA Today. 4","With all due respect, son, I'd say you've got that one precisely backwards. My confidence isn't in question. What you might be seeing is a leader who thinks things through, considers all the angles, and doesn't jump to conclusions just to look tough. That's not a lack of confidence; that's just good judgment.

I'm confident in my convictions, confident in this great country, and confident in the American people. Always have been. Always will be."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday, you commuted the sentences of 214 federal inmates. It was the largest single-day grant of commutations in the history of the American presidency. So I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about your clemency thought process. One is, you’ve talked about this as low-level drug offenders who got mandatory minimum sentences, but about a quarter of the commutations you’ve made also had firearms offenses. Given your overall philosophy on firearms, can you reconcile that for us? And given that previously in your presidency you had sent a memo to the Office of Pardon Attorney saying there was sort of a predisposition against firearms to be granted clemency, why did you change your mind on that? Also, the other side of the ledger here is pardons. You’ve granted more commutations than any President since Calvin Coolidge. You’ve granted fewer pardons than any two-term President since John Adams. Why is that? Is the focus on commutations taking energy away from pardons, especially since these are -- you’ve talked about second chances; a full pardon would give people a better chance at those second chances. ",Good.,"Thank you, thank you. Good to be with you. That's a very fair question, and it gives me a chance to really lay out the thinking here, because it's important.

First, let me be clear about these commutations. What we're doing here is correcting for a period in our history where we got tough on crime, and in some cases, we got *too* tough. We ended up with mandatory minimum sentences that swept up thousands of non-violent offenders, many of whom were serving disproportionate sentences, decades for offenses that just don't warrant that kind of time. These are folks who have paid their debt, in many cases, more than paid their debt, and they deserve a second chance to rejoin their families and contribute to their communities. That's the fundamental principle.

Now, on the firearms question. You're right, some of these cases did involve a firearms offense. But let's look at the context. My administration is absolutely committed to upholding the Second Amendment, and we're absolutely committed to prosecuting violent criminals who misuse firearms. No doubt about it. But in many of these commutation cases, the firearm charge was often incidental to a low-level drug offense. It wasn't about someone going out and committing a violent act with a gun. It might have been a gun found in a home where drugs were present, or a gun present during a transaction. It triggered these incredibly harsh mandatory minimums, often turning a relatively minor drug offense into a sentence that was exponentially longer.

My previous memo, as you noted, reflected a general disposition, and that's still largely true: we have to be careful. But as President, you learn, you gather more information, you see the real-world impact of these policies. When you see someone serving 20 or 30 years because a firearm was *present* – not necessarily *used violently* – during a low-level drug offense, and that's what pushed them over the edge into a truly draconian sentence, then you have to ask yourself, ""Is this truly justice?"" My commitment to firearms safety and the Second Amendment is unwavering, but my commitment to *fairness* and *proportionality* in sentencing is just as strong. We're talking about specific circumstances where the law created an injustice, and we're working to fix that.

Now, on the pardons versus commutations. Look, the focus of this administration, and my personal focus, has been on the urgent need to address the thousands of individuals *currently incarcerated* under these outdated and overly harsh sentencing laws. These are people whose lives are literally on hold, families torn apart, communities missing their members. A commutation is about *getting them home*. It's about immediately rectifying a present injustice.

Pardons, while incredibly important, are a different mechanism. They are for individuals who have already completed their sentences and are seeking to clear their names, restore their rights, and move past their conviction entirely. It's about post-conviction restoration. We absolutely process pardon requests, and we take them seriously, but the sheer scale of the mandatory minimum problem, and the immediate human cost of mass incarceration, has naturally meant that the bulk of our resources and attention have been dedicated to these commutation efforts.

It's not that one is taking energy away from the other, it's about prioritizing where the most immediate and profound impact on human lives can be made right now. Granting these commutations *is* granting second chances, vital second chances, for individuals to rebuild their lives. It's about bringing people home, and that's a cornerstone of our commitment to a more just and fair criminal justice system. We're working hard on both, but the urgency of the commutation cases, I believe, speaks for itself."
" And then finally, just one other thing on pardons. Many of your predecessors in the final days of their presidency have saved -- reserved that for their more politically sensitive pardons. Should we expect you to do that? Or would you rule that out? Thanks. ","Okay. I appreciate the question, Gregory, because I haven’t had a chance to talk about this much and this is an effort that I’m really proud of. It is my view, shared by Democrats and Republicans alike in many quarters, that as successful as we’ve been in reducing crime in this country, the extraordinary rate of incarceration of nonviolent offenders has created its own set of problems that are devastating. Entire communities have been ravaged where largely men, but some women, are taken out of those communities. Kids are now growing up without parents. It perpetuates a cycle of poverty and disorder in their lives. It is disproportionately young men of color that are being arrested at higher rates, charged and convicted at higher rates, and imprisoned for longer sentences. 5 And so ultimately, the fix on this is criminal justice reform. And I still hold out hope that the bipartisan effort that’s taking place in Congress can finish the job and we can have a criminal justice system, at least at the federal level, that is both smart on crime, effective on crime, but recognizes the need for proportionality in sentencing and the need to rehabilitate those who commit crimes. But even as that slow process of criminal justice reform goes forward, what I wanted to see is we could reinvigorate the pardon process and commutation process that had become stalled over the course of several years -- partly because it’s politically risky. You commute somebody and they commit a crime, and the politics of it are tough. And everybody remembers the Willie Horton ad. And so the bias I think of my predecessors and, frankly, a number of my advisors early in my presidency is, be careful about that. But I thought it was very important for us to send a clear message that we believe in the principles behind criminal justice reform even if ultimately we need legislation. So we have focused more on commutations than we have on pardons. I would argue, Gregory, that by the time I leave office, the number of pardons that we grant will be roughly in line with what other Presidents have done. But standing up this commutations process has required a lot of effort and a lot of energy, and it’s not like we got a new slug of money to do it. So you’ve got limited resources. The primary job of the Justice Department is to prevent crime and to convict those who have committed crimes and to keep the American people safe. And that means that you’ve had this extraordinary and Herculean effort by a lot of people inside the Justice Department to go above and beyond what they’re doing to also review these petitions that have been taking place. And we’ve been able to get bar organizations around the country to participate, to kind of screen and help people apply. And what we -- the main criteria that I’ve tried to set is if under today’s laws -- because there have been changes in how we charge nonviolent drug offenses -- if under today’s charges, their sentences would be substantially lower than the charges that they received, if they got a life sentence but a U.S. attorney or the Justice Department indicates that today they’d be likely to get 20 years and they’ve already served 25, then what we try to do is to screen through and find those individuals who have paid their debt to society, that have behaved themselves and tried to reform themselves while incarcerated, and we think have a good 6 chance of being able to use that second chance well. On the firearms issue, what I've done is to try to screen out folks who seem to have a propensity for violence. And so -- and these are just hypotheticals, but there may be a situation where a kid at 18 was a member of a gang, had a firearm, did not use it in the offense that he was charged in, there's no evidence that he used it in any violence offense, it's still a firearms charge in enhancement, but he didn't use it. He's now 48 -- or 38, 20 years later, and has a unblemished prison record, has gone back to school, gotten his GED, has gone through drug treatment, has the support of the original judge that presided, the support of the U.S. attorney that charged him, support of the warden, has a family that loves him. And in that situation, the fact that he had 20 years early an enhancement because he had a firearm is different than a situation where somebody has engaged in armed robbery and shot somebody. In those cases, that is still something that I'm concerned about. Our focus really has been on people who we think were overcharged and people who we do not believe have a propensity towards violence. And in terms of your last question about sort of last-minute pardons that are granted, the process that I put in place is not going to vary depending on how close I get to the election. So it's going to be reviewed by the pardon attorney, it will be reviewed by my White House counsel, and I'm going to, as best as I can, make these decisions based on the merits, as opposed to political considerations. And finally, Jim Miklaszewski is retiring after 30 years at NBC. He has done an outstanding job, mostly covering the Department of Defense. This may be my last press conference here, so I just wanted to thank Jim for the extraordinary career that he's had and the great job that he's done. And he gets the last question.","Well, that's a fair question, and it's certainly true that presidents, myself included, have faced these decisions and traditions surrounding the pardon power. The pardon is one of the most solemn and significant constitutional powers granted to the President, and throughout my tenure, I've approached it with the utmost gravity and respect for the law.

Each case, irrespective of when it's considered – whether it's in the early days or the later ones – demands individual attention, a careful weighing of the circumstances, and a judgment about what's ultimately just and good for the nation. I'm not going to preview specific timing or particular cases, but I assure you that every decision made will be based on its merits and with a commitment to justice and fairness for all involved. That's always been my guiding principle."
" Thank you very much, Mr. President. ",You bet. 7,"Oh, you are most welcome. It's always a pleasure. Thank *you* for being here."
" First, back to ISIS and Iran and Syria. Your very own national counterterrorism operation has found that despite all of the decisive defeats that the U.S. and coalition have dealt ISIS on the battlefield, that they've expanded their threat worldwide to include as many as 18 operational bases. In the six years you've been dealing, do you feel any personal disappointment that there hasn't been more progress? And in any discussions you've had with the U.S. military and your intelligence agencies, have you come up with any new ideas on how to deal or defeat ISIS? ","Every time there is a terrorist attack I feel disappointment because I'd like to prevent all of them. And that's true not just when the attacks are in Europe or in the United States. When you read stories about attacks in Lebanon or Iraq or Afghanistan or distant parts of the world that don't get as much attention, they get my attention because that's somebody's kid and that's somebody's mom and that's somebody who was just going about his business, and mindlessly, senselessly, this person was murdered. So I haven't gotten numb to it. It bugs me whenever it happens and wherever it happens. And we are constantly pushing ourselves to see are there additional ideas that we can deploy to defeat this threat. Now, it is important that we recognize terrorism as a tactic has been around for a long time. And if you look at the '70s or the '80s or the '90s, there was some terrorist activity somewhere in the world that was brutal. And as much as I would like to say that during my eight-year presidency we could have eliminated terrorism completely, it's not surprising that that hasn't happened and I don't expect that will happen under the watch of my successors. I do think that because of our extraordinary efforts, the homeland is significantly safer than it otherwise would be. Now, in some ways this is arguing the counterfactuals, but the attacks we prevent I take great satisfaction in, and I am grateful for the extraordinary work that our teams do. I don't think there's any doubt that had we not destroyed al Qaeda in the FATA that more Americans would have been killed, and we might have seen more attacks like we saw on 9/11. And we have maintained vigilance, recognizing that those threats still remain, those aspirations in the minds of these folks still remain, but it is much harder for them to carry out large-scale attacks like that than it used to be. 8 What we have seen is that these lower-level attacks carried out by fewer operatives or an individual with less sophisticated and less expensive weapons can do real damage. And that, I think, points to the need for us to not just have a military strategy, not just have a traditional counterterrorism strategy that's designed to bust up networks and catch folks before they carry out their attacks -- although those still are necessary, and we have to be more and more sophisticated about how we carry those out, it still requires us to have much greater cooperation with our partners around the world -- but it points to the fact that we're going to have to do a better job in draining the ideology that is behind these attacks, that right now is emanating largely out of the Middle East and a very small fraction of the Muslim world a perversion of Islam that has taken root and has been turbocharged over the Internet, and that is appealing to even folks who don’t necessarily know anything about Islam and aren’t even practicing Islam in any serious way, but have all kinds of psychosis and latch on to this as some way of being important and magnifying themselves. And that's tougher because that involves both changes in geopolitics in places like Syria. It requires cultural changes in regions like the Middle East and North Africa that are going through generational changes and shifts as the old order collapses. It requires psychology and thinking about how do these messages of hate reach individuals and are there ways in which we can intervene ahead of time. And all that work is being done. And we've got the very best people at it, and each day they're making a difference in saving lives -- not just here, but around the world. But it's a challenge precisely because if you're successful 99 percent of the time, that 1 percent can still mean heartbreak for families. And it's difficult because in a country, let's say, of 300 million people here in the United States, if 99.9 percent of people are immune from this hateful ideology but one-tenth of 1 percent are susceptible to it, that's a lot of dangerous people running around. And we can't always anticipate them ahead of time because they may not have criminal records. So this is going to be a challenge. I just want to end on the point that I made earlier. How we react to this is as important as the efforts we take to destroy ISIL, prevent these networks from penetrating. You can't separate those two things out. The reason it's called terrorism, as opposed to just a standard war, is that these are weak enemies that can't match us in conventional power, but what they can do is make us scared. And when societies get scared, they can react in ways that undermine the fabric of our society. 9 It makes us weaker and makes us more vulnerable, and creates politics that divide us in ways that hurt us over the long term. And so if we remain steady and steadfast and vigilant, but also take the long view and maintain perspective and remind ourselves of who we are and what we care about most deeply, and what we cherish and what's good about this country, and what's good about the international order and civilization that was built in part because of the sacrifices of our men and women after a 20th century full of world war -- if we remember that, then we're going to be okay. But we're still going to see, episodically, these kinds of tragedies, and we're going to have to keep working on until we make things better.","Alright, let me be very clear about this.

First, the United States of America, and our incredible coalition partners, we absolutely *decimated* the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. We took away their territory, we took away their so-called ""state,"" and we took out their leadership. That was a decisive defeat on the battlefield, and our brave men and women in uniform did an outstanding job accomplishing that mission. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Now, this enemy, radical Islamic terrorists, they are a cancer. And like a cancer, even when you cut out the main tumor, elements try to metastasize, they try to find new hosts. Our intelligence agencies, the best in the world, they are constantly monitoring this threat, and yes, we're seeing these elements try to reconstitute, try to find new footholds in other parts of the world – Africa, parts of Asia. This is an adaptive enemy, and we have to be equally adaptive and vigilant.

Do I feel personal disappointment? Look, this isn't about feelings. This is about protecting American lives and American interests. This is a long-term struggle against an evil ideology. We knew going in that eliminating the physical caliphate wasn't the end of the fight, but a critical phase in it. My resolve, and the resolve of this nation, is stronger than ever. We're not going to quit until this threat is completely eradicated.

And on new ideas? Absolutely. I am in constant discussions – daily, weekly – with our top generals, our intelligence chiefs, the best minds in the world. We are continuously refining our strategy. We're enhancing intelligence sharing with our allies, we're putting more resources into cutting off their funding, we're countering their twisted ideology online, and our special operations forces remain engaged, keeping the pressure on these terrorists wherever they try to hide. We're not going to give them an inch. We're not going to let them establish another caliphate. Not on my watch. We are going to win this fight."
" If I may, Mr. President -- ",You may only because this is your retirement.,"Yes, you may. What's on your mind?"
 I was hoping you'd -- ,But I hope it's not too long because --,"--just tell me what's on your mind. Because that's how we get things done in this great country. We listen, and then we act for the American people."
" No, no -- ",-- I'm going to be late for my birthday dinner.,"Now, hold on a second there, folks. I hear you, I do, but let's just take a breath and make sure we're looking at the whole picture. Because what we're discussing here, it's not just a minor point, it's about fundamental principles. It's about what makes this country strong, what makes it exceptional. We've got to get it right. Believe me."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I want to ask you about tomorrow, the next leg of your trip, a little bit. And tomorrow you're going to be meeting for the first time with President Duterte, and he’s a leader whose war on drugs has led to the death of about 2,400 people in just the last two months since he took office. And today he said in a very colorful way that you better not bring this up. And I'm wondering, are you are committed to raising this with President Duterte? And are you concerned that meeting him legitimizes his approach on this issue? ","Well, I just came out of a long day of meetings, so I just heard about some of this. But I have seen some of those colorful statements in the past, and so, clearly, he’s a colorful guy. And what I’ve instructed my team to do is to talk to their Philippine counterparts to find out is this, in fact, a time where we can have some constructive, productive conversations. Obviously, the Filipino people are some of our closest friends and allies, and the Philippines is a treaty ally of ours. But I always want to make sure that if I'm having a meeting that it's actually productive and we're getting something done. We recognize the significant burden that the drug trade plays just not just in the Philippines, but around the world. And fighting narco-trafficking is tough. But we will always assert the need to have due process and to engage in that fight against drugs in a way that's consistent with basic international norms. And so, undoubtedly, if and when we have a meeting, that this is something that's going to be brought up, and my expectation, my hope is, is that it could be dealt with constructively. But I'll have my team discuss this. I've got a whole bunch of folks that I'm going to be meeting with over the course of the next several days. And, as I said, historically, our relationship with the Philippines is one of our most important, and my relationship with the Philippine people has been extraordinarily warm and productive. So I expect that will continue. But I want to make sure that the setting is right and the timing is right for us to have the best conversation possible.","Thank you for the question. It's an important one.

Look, the reports coming out of the Philippines regarding the war on drugs and the tragic loss of life are certainly concerning, and we've been following them very closely. When I meet with any world leader, particularly a close and long-standing ally like the Philippines, I believe in having a candid and direct conversation on all issues of importance. Our commitment to human rights, due process, and the rule of law isn't just a talking point; it's fundamental to who we are as Americans, and it's a principle we champion globally. So yes, these are precisely the kinds of concerns that will be raised, directly and respectfully, in our private discussions.

As for President Duterte's comments today, well, I've heard them. But I've always believed that the most effective diplomacy happens when leaders can speak frankly with one another, without equivocation. My job is to represent the American people and our values, and I intend to do just that.

Regarding the idea of legitimizing his approach: diplomacy, by its very nature, requires engagement. It requires sitting down, listening, and expressing our perspective, even when there are serious disagreements. The United States has a vital strategic alliance with the Philippines, one that's crucial for regional security and stability. To shy away from that meeting would be to abandon our responsibilities, both to our ally and to our principles. My purpose in meeting with President Duterte is not to endorse specific policies, but to strengthen our relationship while also making our clear concerns known and working towards outcomes that uphold human dignity and the rule of law. That's what a President does."
 So you're not going to meet with him? ,"Well I'm -- no, as I said, I'm going to just make an assessment. I just got out of these meetings. What is certainly true is, is that the issues of how we approach fighting crime and drug trafficking is a serious one for all of us, and we've got to do it the right way. Michelle Kosinski.","Look, we're doing a tremendous job, the best job anyone has ever seen, believe me. As for a meeting, we'll see. A lot of very important things are happening, frankly, things nobody thought were possible. We're always evaluating the situation. I'm very busy, incredibly busy, focused on making America great again. If a meeting makes sense, a *real* sense, then maybe. But we're not going to do something just for show. We'll see what happens. Big things are coming."
" Thank you. Same subject, I guess, of colorful guys. What can you tell us about this hour-and-a-half-long meeting you had with President Putin -- the tone of it, any progress that was made? And do you agree with him that the relationship between our two countries is now frozen? On the cyber front, Senator Reid recently cited intelligence briefings when he was expressing his suspicions that Russia is trying to meddle in the election and may even have direct ties to one of the campaigns. What can you tell us? Do you think Russia is trying to influence the U.S. election through hacking? ","Well, President Putin is less colorful, but typically the tone of our meetings are candid, blunt, businesslike --- and this one was no different. We had a range of issues that we had to discuss, but the two most important were, as has been reported, discussions that have been taking place between Secretary Kerry and Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, about ways in which we can institute a meaningful, serious, verifiable Cessation of Hostilities in Syria, and our capacity to provide some humanitarian relief to families, children, women who are suffering enormously under the burdens of that war. As you'll recall, we had initiated a Cessation of Hostilities a while back. Initially, it did lessen some of the violence, and then slowly it unwound. And we're back into a situation in which Assad's regime is bombing with impunity. That, in turn, we think is actually strengthening the capacity of Nusra to recruit people who might not have initially been sympathetic to terrorism but now view anyone who’s fighting against Assad as legitimized. And that is a very dangerous dynamic. And so we have had some productive conversations about what a real Cessation of Hostilities would look like that would allow us both, the United States and Russia, to focus our attention on common enemies, like ISIL and Nusra. But given the gaps of trust that exist, that's a tough negotiation, and we haven’t yet closed the gaps in a way where we think it would actually work. But my instructions to Secretary Kerry, and Mr. Putin's instructions to Mr. Lavrov was to keep working at it over the next several days -- because the faster we can provide some relief to folks on the ground, the better off we're going to be. And that, then, is a predicate for us to be able to transition into a serious conversation about a political solution to this problem that would involve all the parties that have either directly or indirectly involved themselves in the Syrian conflict. We also spent time talking about Ukraine. There is a Minsk agreement that arose out of the Normandy negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany, but it hasn’t been implemented. And I made very clear that until it is implemented, the United States is not going to pull down sanctions; that it is important for both sides to try to seize this opportunity in the coming weeks to finalize an agreement and to figure out a sequence in which that document is put into effect. And there was agreement not just between myself and Mr. Putin, but also with Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande, that that effort should increase in urgency over the next several weeks. And so that what was constructive but not conclusive. And we'll have to see whether we can actually get this done, or whether, in fact, President Putin -- despite talking about wanting a negotiation and a solution -- in fact, is comfortable with this constant low-grade conflict along the Russia-Ukraine border. And finally, we did talk about cybersecurity, generally. I'm not going to comment on specific investigations that are still live and active. But I will tell you that we've had problems with cyber intrusions from Russia in the past, from other countries in the past. And, look, we're moving into a new era here where a number of countries have significant capacities. And, frankly, we got more capacity than anybody both offensively and defensively. But our goal is not to suddenly, in the cyber arena, duplicate a cycle of escalation that we saw when it comes to other arms races in the past, but rather to start instituting some norms so that everybody is acting responsibly. We're going to have enough problems in the cyberspace with non-state actors who are engaging in theft and using the Internet for all kinds of illicit practices, and protecting our critical infrastructure, and making sure that our financial systems are sound. And what we cannot do is have a situation in which suddenly this becomes the Wild, Wild West, where countries that have significant cyber capacity start engaging in competition -- unhealthy competition or conflict through these means when, I think, wisely we've put in place some norms when it comes to using other weapons. So that's been a topic of conversation with President Putin as it has been with other countries. We've started to get some willingness on the part of a lot of countries around the world, including through our G20 process, to adopt these norms, but we've got to make sure that we're observing them. William Wan.","Well, thank you for those questions. Always good to speak directly with the press.

Regarding my meeting with President Putin, I'd say it was a frank and direct discussion. We covered a lot of ground, and it's always important for leaders, especially of major powers, to be able to sit down and speak plainly with one another. We laid out our concerns, and he laid out his. As for progress, sometimes progress is simply establishing a clearer understanding of where each side stands, and making sure lines of communication remain open. That's a vital first step, especially on complex issues.

""Frozen"" is a strong word to describe the relationship. I'd say there are certainly areas where we face significant challenges, and where our interests don't always align. But even in difficult times, dialogue is essential. We have to continue to engage, to find common ground where possible, and to manage our disagreements responsibly. My administration is committed to protecting American interests, and sometimes that means a tough but necessary conversation.

Now, on the subject of cyber security and our elections – that's something we take with the utmost seriousness. The integrity of our democratic process is paramount. Senator Reid and others have raised concerns, and we are certainly aware of those. My administration is absolutely committed to ensuring that our elections are secure and free from any foreign interference. We are constantly working to strengthen our cyber defenses and to investigate any and all credible allegations of attempts to meddle in our democratic process.

As for specific intelligence reports or ongoing investigations, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on those details publicly. We don't get ahead of the facts. But let me be absolutely clear: America's elections belong to the American people, and we will do everything in our power to protect them from external influence, whoever the perpetrator may be. We will follow the facts wherever they lead and hold anyone accountable who seeks to undermine the trust the American people place in their government and their electoral system."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Heading into Laos, what are the main things you can offer its leaders? And what do you plan to push for in return? On the offering side, for example, I'm wondering how you view U.S. responsibility for unexploded ordnance. On the asking side, what are you pushing for most? Is it human rights? Closer U.S. ties in the face of China? Improving their problems with governance and corruption? What's the priority? ","Well, look, symbolically, it is important. I'll be the first U.S. President to visit Laos. And when you think about the history of the United States and Laos, I think it’s useful to see what’s happened in the evolution of our relationship with Vietnam, a country that I just visited recently. At the outset, as we’re trying to build trust, a lot of work can be done around war legacy issues. For the Lao, that involves dealing with unexploded ordnance, which is still plaguing big chunks of the countryside. And since Laos is still a relatively poor country that is developing, their capacity alone to clean that up is hampered by a lack of resources. We should help. And my expectation is, is that, in our meetings over the course of several days, that we’ll be able to provide some really concrete assistance that ensures that innocent kids who are running through a field, or a farmer that’s trying to clear a field, or a business that’s trying to get set up -- that they’re not endangered by the possibility of an explosion. Likewise, we have deep commitments to accounting for those who were lost during that war. And as was true with Vietnam, to the extent that we’re able to find out more about our missing-in-action and our POWs, that not only provides enormous comfort and meaning for families and is consistent with our traditions, but it also ends up being a show of good faith on the part of the country, and a way for us to move into a next phase of a relationship. And so a lot of the conversation I think will start there, but it doesn’t end there. We’ve had an initiative, for example, helping all the countries along the Mekong Delta to find ways to harness development and deal with environmental issues. And that’s something that we’ve been doing through ASEAN over the course of several years now. For us to be able to expand some of that work I think would be important. Establishing people-to-people exchanges is another area that historically has been important. I do think Laos -- seeing the enormous economic progress that Vietnam and China and others have made, are going to be very interested in finding ways in which they can advance into the global economy and help themselves grow, and I think that we can be a useful partner there. So I think there will be a broad-based agenda. But if you think about the visit I made to Ho Chi Minh City, and driving through those streets, and the enormous wellspring of goodwill that you saw -- that started with some of the same kinds of steps that we’re going to be taking with Laos. But I think we can hopefully do it faster, make more progress faster than we did over the course of 10, 15 years, because we’ve learned some things. And I think Laos is very eager to engage with us, and we’re eager to engage with them. So I look forward to visiting what I hear is a beautiful country. Christi Parsons.","Thank you for that question. It's an important one, and one my administration takes very seriously as we look to strengthen our vital partnerships in Southeast Asia. Heading into Laos, we approach this visit with a clear understanding of history, a commitment to shared values, and an eye towards a prosperous and stable future for both our nations.

On the offering side, let me be very clear: The United States has a deep and abiding responsibility for the legacy of unexploded ordnance in Laos. This is not just a humanitarian issue, it is a moral imperative. My administration will reaffirm our commitment to providing significant resources, technology, and training to accelerate UXO clearance efforts. We're talking about more funding for surveys, demining operations, and support for victims. This isn't charity; it's a demonstration of American resolve to address the consequences of past conflicts and to help the Lao people live in safety and build a brighter future for their children. Beyond UXO, we will offer to deepen our economic partnership, exploring increased trade and investment opportunities that are fair and transparent, and supporting sustainable development initiatives in areas like education, healthcare, and infrastructure – always with an emphasis on Lao ownership and capacity building.

Now, as for what we plan to push for in return, it's about building a robust, resilient partnership based on mutual respect and shared interests.

First, and this is always a priority for the American people, we will steadfastly advocate for greater respect for **human rights** and improvements in **governance and anti-corruption**. We believe that stable, prosperous societies are built on a foundation of respect for individual freedoms, transparent institutions, and the rule of law. We will encourage open dialogue on these issues, pressing for progress on fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech and assembly, and for serious efforts to combat corruption which hinders economic development and erodes public trust. These aren't just American values; they are universal aspirations that lead to stronger, more resilient nations.

Second, we aim to deepen **closer U.S. ties** and offer Laos a diverse array of partners for its future. This isn't about forcing Laos to choose between the United States and any other nation, but rather about empowering them to diversify their relationships and enhance their sovereignty. We want to be a strong, reliable partner that supports Laos's independence and its ability to make decisions that best serve its own national interests. This means working together on regional security, counter-narcotics efforts, and ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific.

So, to distill it down: On the offering side, our priority is undoubtedly our continued, resolute commitment to **UXO remediation and humanitarian assistance**. It's a foundational element of trust and reconciliation. On the asking side, my administration views **human rights and good governance** as the bedrock. These are the elements that foster long-term stability, attract sustainable investment, and ultimately allow a nation to truly flourish and stand strong on the world stage. They are essential for a deep, enduring, and mutually beneficial partnership with the United States."
" Thank you, Mr. President. On the Transpacific Partnership, how do you plan to sell this to these Asian leaders who still have work to do in their own countries, and with some political -- you know, it’s not -- the politics aren’t easy, and maybe they don’t want to do that. So much of it seems like the future is rocky in the U.S. Can you -- the U.S. usually ratifies its trade deals. Do you plan to convey a sense of inevitability? Do you feel that for the lame duck session, even if it doesn’t happen then, do you feel like it’s inevitable anyway? And, if I may, I wonder what you think about the silent protest of Colin Kaepernick? And I also wonder what you think about the public response to it, which is really divided. I mean, some police don’t want to secure ‘49ers games, and many fans feel that he’s giving voice to something they feel strongly. So I just wonder how you look at that. ","Well, with respect to TPP, I don’t have to sell it to Asian leaders here who were part of the negotiations because they see this as the right thing to do for their own countries. And when you look at the architecture, the structure of TPP, what it does is open up new markets for us that are generally closed. Our markets are more open than theirs for the most part, so we benefit from a reduction in tariffs and taxes that are already in place. But for many of them, what they benefit from is this trade deal is the spur, the incentive for them to engage in a whole bunch of structural reforms that they know, over the long term, will reinvigorate their economy. So, for example, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, yes, he’s having to make some difficult decisions about opening up markets that previously have been closed, but he’s also looking at a couple of decades of stagnation and anemic growth. And what he said to the Japanese people is, if we want to break out of this, then we’re going to have to change how we do business, and this provides us a road map of how we can become more competitive on the world stage. Vietnam, that, for the first time, is debating in a very serious way how they can provide protections to their workers and allow them to participate and have voice and bargain for wages, and, yeah, that’s tough politically for Vietnam. On the other hand, they recognize that if they want to move up the value chain in the global market that they’ve got to start abiding by basic norms. So the good news is they’re ready to go. And what I’ll be telling them is that the United States has never had a smooth, uncontroversial path to ratifying trade deals, but they eventually get done. And it’s my intention to get this one done, because, on the merits, it is smart for America to do it. And I have yet to hear a persuasive argument from the left or the right as to why we wouldn’t want to create a trade framework that raises labor standards, raising environmental standards, protects intellectual property, levels the playing field for U.S. businesses, brings down tariffs. It is indisputable that it would create a better deal for us than the status quo. Nobody has been able to describe to me -- with all the general criticism of trade that you hear coming out of some quarters, nobody is able to describe to me how this would not be a significant improvement for U.S. workers and U.S. businesses going forward compared to the status quo. And so I intend to be making that argument. I will have to be less persuasive here because most people already understand that. Back home, we'll have to cut through the noise once election season is over. It's always a little noisy there. And in terms of Mr. Kaepernick, I got to confess that I haven’t been thinking about football while I've been over here, and I haven’t been following this closely. But my understanding, at least, is, is that he's exercising his constitutional right to make a statement. I think there's a long history of sports figures doing so. I think there are a lot of ways you can do it. As a general matter, when it comes to the flag and the National Anthem, and the meaning that that holds for our men and women in uniform and those who fought for us, that is a tough thing for them to get past to then hear what his deeper concerns are. But I don’t doubt his sincerity, based on what I've heard. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about. And if nothing else, what he's done is he's generated more conversation around some topics that need to be talked about. So, again, I haven’t been paying close attention to it, but you've heard me talk about in the past the need for us to have an active citizenry. Sometimes that's messy and controversial, and it gets people angry and frustrated. But I'd rather have young people who are engaged in the argument and trying to think through how they can be part of our democratic process than people who are just sitting on the sidelines and not paying attention at all. 0 And my suspicion is, is that over time he's going to refine how he's thinking about it, and maybe some of his critics will start seeing that he has a point around certain concerns about justice and equality. And that's how we move forward. Sometimes it's messy, but it's the way democracy works. All right, last one. Angela Greiling Keane of Bloomberg.","Well, thank you for those questions. Very, very important questions, both of them.

First, on this Transpacific Partnership. Look, folks, we've got to be smart about trade. We've got to be *tough* about trade. And frankly, when you look at TPP, you have to ask yourself: Is this deal truly putting America first? Is it creating jobs for American workers, or is it sending them overseas? My job, my *only* job, is to fight for the American people, for our industries, for our incredible workers.

So, when you talk about selling this to Asian leaders, what I'm going to sell is a deal that benefits the United States of America. We want fair trade, we want reciprocal trade, not these multilateral agreements that have often been a disaster for us in the past. We've got to negotiate *hard*, we've got to get *great* deals. And if a deal isn't great for us, believe me, it's not inevitable. Nothing is inevitable if it's not good for our country. We're going to make sure that when we do trade, it's a winning proposition for every single American. The future isn't rocky, the future is *tremendous* if we put America first in every single negotiation.

Now, on the other matter, Colin Kaepernick. Look, it's a very, very clear issue for me. When you're out there, playing on that field, making millions of dollars, you have an obligation to show respect for our country, for our flag, and for our national anthem. That flag, that anthem, it represents something incredibly special. It represents our history, our values, and most importantly, it represents the incredible men and women in our military who put their lives on the line every single day to protect our freedoms. And it represents our police officers, who do a dangerous job, a *very* dangerous job, keeping our communities safe.

To kneel during that anthem, it's a tremendous disrespect. It's disrespectful to our heroes, to the people who've fought and died for this nation. And frankly, it's disrespectful to the very idea of what makes America great. People are divided? I think most good, patriotic Americans understand that you stand for the flag. You stand for the anthem. You show respect. We need unity in this country, and that starts with respecting our symbols, respecting our law enforcement, and respecting our military. It's really that simple."
" Thanks very much, Mr. President. There’s been a lot of talk back at home and here about how you were received on this trip, your last to Asia. Donald Trump said you were humiliated. I suspect you think that was overblown, but -- ",Yes.,"Well, thank you for that question. And let me just say, I appreciate you bringing it up. ""Humiliated,"" you say? *[A slight, dismissive chuckle, shaking head just a bit]* Look, I've been around the block a few times, and I've learned that in this job, you're always gonna have folks in the peanut gallery, you know, throwing stones. And frankly, some of 'em, they just thrive on that kind of negativity and bluster.

My focus, and the focus of this administration, has always been on the important work. We came to Asia to strengthen alliances, to talk about trade, to ensure security in a vital region of the world, and to represent the American people with dignity and purpose. And that's exactly what we did.

Every leader I met with understood the stakes. They understood America's commitment. And we had serious, productive discussions on a range of critical issues – issues that will lead to tangible outcomes for American jobs and American security, not about some, you know, fleeting headline or a soundbite from folks who perhaps aren't as focused on the actual substance of foreign policy.

So, ""humiliated""? No, I don't think so. Not when you're doing the Lord's work, strengthening our nation, and standing up for freedom and prosperity around the globe. We conducted ourselves with honor, and we achieved our objectives. And that's what truly matters at the end of the day."
" Maybe you could talk about whether or not you think your reception here was at all limited to some of the -- or at all related to the limits and challenges of your Asia pivot policy. And while we're talking about legacy items, if I could just ask another quick one on Guantanamo Bay. You have four months left, 60 prisoners left. At this point, are you willing to acknowledge that the prison will be open by the time you leave office? ","Well, in terms of my reception here as far as I can tell has been terrific. I don't know if you’ve gone and talked to some people in Laos. They seem pretty happy about my visit. Everywhere we've gone, we've had a great reception -- just as earlier when we went to Vietnam we got a great reception. You will recall there were millions of people lining the streets. So if this theory about my reception and my rebalance policy is based on me going down the short stairs in China, yes, I think that is overblown. And I think that any reasonable person, certainly any person in the region, would be puzzled as to how this became somehow indicative of the work that we've done here. If you look at the remarks of leaders, if you look at the remarks of ordinary people, if you look at the concrete work that we've gotten done on everything from economic programs to development programs, to legacy of war issues, to promoting civil society and young people, the concern that I've heard is not that what we've done hasn't been important and successful; the concern that I've heard is will it continue. And almost uniformly, the question I get from other leaders is, we hope that America’s interest and presence and engagement is sustained. And my hope and expectation is, is that my successor will, in fact, sustain this kind of engagement, because there is a lot happening here. You’ve got countries here that are taking off. You’ve got one of the most dynamic and youngest populations in the world. This is where the action is going to be when it comes to commerce and trade, and ultimately creating U.S. jobs by being able to sell to this market. And that's the only feedback that I've received. And that's not just based on what leaders tell me. If you read local newspapers or you talk to people, that's been the same commentary that we receive generally. With respect to Guantanamo, I am not ready to concede that it may still remain open because we're still working diligently to continue to shrink the population. I continue to believe that Guantanamo is a recruitment tool for terrorist organizations, that it clouds and sours some of the counterterrorism cooperation that we need to engage in. And it's not necessary and it's hugely expensive for U.S. taxpayers. Is there strong resistance in Congress? Absolutely. But as we continue to shrink the population to the point where we're looking at 40 or 50 people and are maintaining a multimillion-dollar operation to house these handfuls of individuals, I think the American people should be asking the question, why are we spending this kind of money that could be spent on other things when it's not necessary for our safety and security. So there's no doubt that because of the politics in Congress right now, it is a tough road to hoe. But I expect to work really hard over the next four months -- five months -- four and a half months. Margaret Brennan.","Alright, let's talk about it.

First, on the Asia pivot. Look, that was a *crucial* strategic move. Absolutely critical for American interests, for our economy, for our national security in a rapidly changing world. Was it easy? No, nothing worth doing ever is on the global stage. Anytime you're dealing with complex regional dynamics, with rising powers, with trade negotiations that stretch across oceans, you're going to face challenges. But our engagement, our commitment to our allies, and our leadership in that region was undeniable. My reception? Well, you know, sometimes in this business, folks like to focus on the bumps in the road rather than the superhighway you're building for future generations. We ensured America was at the table, strong and leading, and that's what truly matters. We laid the groundwork for decades of American influence and prosperity.

Now, on Guantanamo Bay. Let me be absolutely clear: my administration has worked tirelessly, from day one, to responsibly address the situation at Gitmo. It's a complicated, deeply sensitive issue. We've brought the numbers down significantly since I took office – that's real progress. But my number one priority, my sacred oath, is to protect the American people. You're talking about individuals who pose significant national security risks, and finding appropriate, secure facilities, navigating the complex legal landscape, and overcoming congressional hurdles – these are not simple matters that you just wave a magic wand at. We've done everything in our power, consistent with protecting our nation, to move forward. We continue to work on it every single day, right up until the last minute. But let me assure you, we will never, ever compromise the safety and security of the United States of America for political expediency. Some decisions are tough, but they're made with our nation's protection as the absolute guiding principle."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Can you tell us if last night Philippine President Duterte offered his apology to you, and if you said to him the U.S. will continue to help the Philippines push back against China? And last night, sir, Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin has been more of a leader than you, and then he said you have reduced American generals to rubble. Do you care to defend your legacy? ",Do I care to defend -- okay.,"Well, thank you for that question. It's good to be here.

First off, regarding President Duterte, we had a very frank and productive conversation last night. Look, the Philippines is a vital ally, a good friend in a very important part of the world. What's important is that we continue to work together on shared challenges, and we always will. We discussed a range of issues, and I made it clear, as I always do, that the United States stands with its allies. We're committed to the security of the Philippines, and we will absolutely continue to help them and other nations in the region uphold international law and ensure freedom of navigation. We believe in a free and open Indo-Pacific, and we'll work with our friends to push back against any coercion or intimidation. That's just what good allies do.

Now, as for some of the other comments you mentioned, look, politics can be a rough business. People say a lot of things. My focus, and the focus of this administration, has always been on the hard work of leading the free world, protecting the American people, and upholding the values that make this nation exceptional.

When it comes to leadership, I believe the strength of America comes from its commitment to freedom, to democracy, and to our alliances. We lead by example, by building up our friends, not tearing them down. And I have the utmost respect for the men and women who serve in our military, including our generals. They are patriots. They're dedicated. They put their lives on the line for this country, and I have always been proud to stand with them, support them, and empower them to defend our nation. To suggest otherwise, frankly, misunderstands the very essence of American strength and purpose.

My legacy? My legacy will be judged by the American people and by history. I'm focused on the job at hand, on ensuring America remains a beacon of liberty and a force for good in the world. And I'm confident that when the dust settles, the American people will see a record of strong leadership, a commitment to our values, and a nation that is safer and stronger than it was before. That's what truly matters."
 Respond. ,"Okay, okay -- respond. Got it. I did shake hands with President Duterte last night. It was not a long interaction. And what I indicated to him is, is that my team should be meeting with his and determine how we can move forward on a whole range of issues. As I said when I was asked about this in China, I don’t take these comments personally, because it seems as if this is a phrase he's used repeatedly, including directed at the Pope and others, and so I think it seems to be just a habit, a way of speaking for him. But as I said in China, we want to partner with the Philippines on the particular issue of narco- traffickers, which is a serious problem in the Philippines. It's a serious problem in the United States and around the world. On that narrow issue, we do want to make sure that the partnership we have is consistent with international norms and rule of law. So we're not going to back off our position that if we're working with a country -- whether it's on antiterrorism, whether it's on going after drug traffickers -- as despicable as these networks may be, as much damage as they do, it is important from our perspective to make sure that we do it the right way, because the consequences of when you do it the wrong way is innocent people get hurt and you have a whole bunch of unintended consequences that don’t solve the problem. It has no impact on our broader relationship with the Philippine people, on the wide range of programs and security cooperation that we have with this treaty ally. And it certainly has no impact in terms of how we interpret our obligations to continue to build on the longstanding alliance that we have with the Philippines however that may play itself out. And my hope and expectation is, is that as President Duterte and his team get acclimated to his new position, that they're able to define and clarify what exactly they want to get done, how that fits in with the work that we're already doing with the Philippine government, and hopefully it will be on a strong footing by the time the next administration comes in. As far as Mr. Trump, I think I've already offered my opinion. I don’t think the guy is qualified to be President of the United States. And every time he speaks, that opinion is confirmed. And I think the most important thing for the public and the press is to just listen to what he says and follow up and ask questions about what appear to be either contradictory or uninformed or outright wacky ideas. There is this process that seems to take place over the course of the election season where somehow behavior that in normal times we would consider completely unacceptable and outrageous becomes normalized, and people start thinking that we should be grading on a curve. But I can tell you from the interactions that I've had over the last eight or nine days with foreign leaders, that this is serious business, and you actually have to know what you're talking about, and you actually have to have done your homework. And when you speak, it should actually reflect thought-out policy that you can implement. And I have confidence that if, in fact, people just listen to what he has to say and look at his track record -- or lack thereof -- that they'll make a good decision. Elise Hu.","Well, hello there! Glad to have the chance to chat. You know, I've always believed that the most important thing we can do is to just keep talking to each other, keep those lines of communication open. It's how we build understanding, and it's how we keep this great nation of ours moving forward. So, yes, I'm responding, and I'm always happy to."
" Thank you very much, Mr. President. On North Korea, there's increasing evidence that China isn’t enforcing economic sanctions, namely when it comes to coal. So what's the next move there in your remaining four and a half months in office? And second, is it time for a fundamental rethink of North Korea policy, given that all these years of condemnations and increasing sanctions haven’t led to a desired outcome? Thank you. ","Well, those are good questions. In my meeting with President Xi, we emphasized the importance of full implementation of the U.N. sanctions that have been put forward. I can tell you that based on not only their presentations but actually intelligence and evidence that we've seen, China has done more on sanctions implementation than they have on some of the previous U.N. Security Council sanctions. But you are absolutely right that there are still places where they need to tighten up. And we continue to indicate to them the importance of tightening those up. You may have noted that China continues to object to the THAAD deployment in the Republic of Korea, one of our treaty allies. And what I've said to President Xi directly is that we cannot have a situation where we're unable to defend either ourselves or our treaty allies against increasingly provocative behavior and escalating capabilities by the North Koreans. And I indicated to him that if the THAAD bothered him, particularly since it has no purpose other than defensive and does not change the strategic balance between the United States and China, that they need to work with us more effectively to change Pyongyang's behavior. Now, when it comes to changing Pyongyang's behavior, it's tough. It is true that our approach -- my approach since I've been President -- is to not reward bad behavior. And that was based on the fact that, before I came into office, you had a pattern in which North Korea would engage in some provocative action and, as a consequence of the equivalent of throwing a tantrum, countries would then try to placate them by giving them humanitarian aid or providing other concessions, or engaging in dialogue, which would relieve some of the pressure, and then they would just go right back to the same provocative behavior later. And so our view was, that wasn’t working, let's trying something else. Now, it is entirely fair to say that they have continued to engage in the development of their nuclear program and these ballistic missile tests. And so we are constantly examining other strategies that we can take, close consultations with Republic of Korea and Japan, as well as China and Russia and others who are interested parties, and we do believe that if there are any signs, at any point, that North Korea is serious about dialogue around denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula, that we'll be ready to have those conversations. It's not as if we are looking for a problem, or avoiding a willingness to engage diplomatically. But diplomacy requires that Pyongyang meet its international obligations, and not only is it failing to meet those international obligations, it's not even suggesting that they have any intention to do so anytime in the future regardless of the inducements that might be put on the table. So, look, we are deeply disturbed by what's happened. We are going to make sure that we put our defensive measures in place so that America is protected, our allies are protected. We will continue to put some of the toughest pressure that North Korea has ever been under as a consequence of this behavior. Can I guarantee that it works? No. But it is the best options that we have available to us right now. And we will continue to explore with all parties involved, including China, other potential means by which we can bring about a change in behavior. Bob Woodruff.","Well, thank you for that question. It's an important one, and North Korea remains a significant challenge to regional and global security.

First, on the reports regarding China and the sanctions – we're watching this very closely, and frankly, we are concerned. China has a unique responsibility here, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and as North Korea's primary trading partner. These aren't just American sanctions; these are international mandates, agreed upon by the world community to prevent Pyongyang from developing and proliferating weapons of mass destruction.

My message to Beijing has been, and will continue to be, absolutely clear: turning a blind eye to illegal coal shipments or other illicit trade fundamentally undermines the international effort to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. It empowers a dangerous regime, and ultimately, it threatens China's own long-term interests in a stable and prosperous region. In these remaining months, we will continue to press this issue directly with President Xi and his leadership team. We expect responsible nations to live up to their commitments, and we will use all diplomatic tools at our disposal to ensure that Beijing understands the strategic costs of failing to enforce these vital sanctions. We must make it clear that there are consequences for enabling Pyongyang's dangerous provocations.

Now, on your second question about a ""fundamental rethink"" of our North Korea policy... Look, it's frustrating, I understand that. We've dealt with this regime for decades, and their defiance is persistent. But let's be clear: the fundamental objective – the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula – that goal is not up for debate. That goal remains paramount, for the security of our allies in the region, for the United States, and for the peace of the world.

What we need isn't to throw out the playbook, but to strengthen our resolve and intensify our strategy. We must continue to apply maximum pressure, working hand-in-glove with our allies – South Korea and Japan – to present a united front. We must ensure that the sanctions are enforced, by every nation, and that Pyongyang understands that its only path to a brighter future is through abandoning its nuclear ambitions.

We always keep the door open for serious, credible diplomacy, but that requires a genuine commitment from the North Korean regime to engage in meaningful negotiations, not just empty gestures. We cannot reward bad behavior. We cannot accept North Korea as a nuclear power. That would send a dangerous signal around the globe.

So, no, I don't believe it's time to abandon our core objective. It's time to be more persistent, more unified, and more creative in applying the necessary pressure to bring Kim Jong Un to the table in a serious way, for the sake of peace and stability in that vital part of the world. Thank you."
" Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I just want to let you know that this is going to be more of a personal question for you. We are almost the same exact age, born August 1961, but I'm two weeks younger than you. ","You know, I noticed that when we were in the gym together, you were working out a little harder than me. So those two weeks clearly are making a difference.","Well, thank you, I appreciate that. It's always good to connect with folks on a personal level. I'm glad to hear we share that August connection, though I've got a few more years on you than just two weeks! I was born back in '46, not '61. But hey, it's all about how young you feel, right? Now, what's on your mind?"
 Correct. ,Josh just happens to be from Kansas City. So I didn’t know if there was any coincidence there. But we wish you the very best of luck in your new endeavors.,"That's right. Absolutely correct. Glad we're on the same page. It's about seeing things clearly, and I appreciate you affirming that."
" As it turns out, there’s no place like Kansas City. ",There you go.,"Well now, you got that right. Kansas City, huh? That's a mighty fine American city. Good, hardworking folks, and you know what? They make some pretty darn good barbecue too. It's got a spirit all its own. That's a place where folks believe in America, believe in community. No place like it? I can certainly see why you'd feel that way."
" You're about to embark on your final foreign trip. What will you say to other world leaders about your successor? They’ve expressed many of the same misgivings that you have about Donald Trump. Should they be worried about the future of U.S. foreign policy? And secondly, as Democrats scramble to regroup after a pretty shocking upset, what is your advice about where the party goes now? And who should lead your party? ","One of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the Commander- in-Chief, the spokesperson for the nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President, it is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries, and our diplomats and other diplomats, and intelligence officers and development workers. And there's enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue. In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships. And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the Transatlantic Alliance. I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship, and a recognition that those alliances aren’t just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world. With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated and it's hard and it's challenging. And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection. I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation. I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge. That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing. The Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles; The belief that we should an economy that works for everybody, not just a few. The belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive. That we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race, or gender, or sexual orientation, or what zip code they were born in. That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn’t just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values. So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn’t be up for debate, should be our North Star. But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about. I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don’t matter if people don’t hear them. And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grassroots level -- something that's been a running thread in my career. I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall. And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There are some counties maybe I won that people didn’t expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for. And the challenge for a national party is how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for. And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press story. It’s increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press. And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up state parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you’re paying attention to, and state rep races and city council races -- that all I think will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future. And I’m optimistic that will happen. For Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I’ve been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset. Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House. And two years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and four years later, I was President of the United States. Things change pretty rapidly. But they don’t change inevitably. They change because you work for it. Nobody said democracy was supposed to be easy. This is hard. And in a big country like this, it probably should be hard. Mark Knoller.","My friends, leaders of the free world, this final journey brings a certain weight, a moment for reflection. I see the questions in your eyes, the concerns you hold – and believe me, I understand them. Many of you have expressed misgivings about the incoming administration, and yes, some of those mirror my own.

Let me be clear: The presidency of the United States is a powerful office, and the man who holds it sets a significant tone. The rhetoric, the approach, the style – these things *will* change. And for a world that has come to rely on a certain predictability and continuity from Washington, that can be unsettling.

However, I want you to remember this: America is more than any single individual. Our alliances, our commitments, our deeply rooted democratic institutions – they are built on decades of shared values, mutual sacrifice, and bipartisan consensus. They are not easily undone. The U.S. will continue to be a nation of laws, a beacon of freedom, and a partner to those who share our ideals.

Should you be worried? Prudence dictates vigilance. There will be adjustments, certainly. There may be moments of friction, and undoubtedly, some strong words. But I urge you to engage, to communicate openly, and to appeal to the fundamental interests that bind us together – security, prosperity, and the pursuit of peace. America's commitment to its allies, to NATO, to our global responsibilities, runs deeper than any single administration. Have faith in the resilience of American democracy, and in the bedrock principles upon which our nation stands. We've navigated choppy waters before, and with steady hands and clear heads, we'll do so again.

---

Now, as for my friends across the aisle, the Democrats, who are undoubtedly reeling from a pretty shocking upset... well, as a lifelong Republican, I believe a strong opposition party is absolutely vital for a healthy republic. So, my advice, offered as an elder statesman who cares deeply about the functioning of our country, is this:

First, you've got to listen. Truly listen. This wasn't just about personalities or policies, it was about a significant chunk of the American people feeling left behind, forgotten, and unrepresented. They felt that Washington, and perhaps the Democratic Party in particular, had stopped speaking *to* them and started speaking *at* them. You need to reconnect with the working men and women in the heartland, the small towns, the communities that feel economically insecure and culturally adrift. Spend less time in coastal echo chambers and more time in diners and factories across America.

Second, don't abandon your principles, but rethink your message. Focus on tangible improvements to people's lives: good jobs, affordable healthcare, quality education, secure retirements. Less on abstract ideology, more on practical solutions that resonate with everyday concerns. Reclaim the narrative on economic opportunity for *everyone*.

And who should lead the party? You need a new generation, plain and simple. Not just fresh faces, but fresh thinking. Someone who can bridge the internal divides within the party, someone who isn't afraid to challenge orthodoxy, and crucially, someone who can speak to the aspirations of a broad coalition of Americans – from the inner cities to the forgotten suburbs, from the Rust Belt to the Sun Belt. Look for leaders with a compelling vision for the future, not just a rehashing of old arguments. And above all, find someone with the humility to listen, the courage to adapt, and the conviction to unite. The nation needs a strong, thoughtful Democratic Party, and to get there, you've got some serious rebuilding ahead."
" Thank you, sir. ",Good to see you.,"Well, you are most welcome. It's been my distinct honor to serve, and that's truly what it's all about."
" Thank you. Good to see you. Mr. President, what can you tell us about the learning curve on becoming President? Can you tell us how long it took you before you were fully at ease in the job, if that ever happens? And did you discuss this matter with President- elect Trump? ","About a week ago I started feeling pretty good. No, look, I think the learning curve always continues. This is a remarkable job. It is like no other job on Earth. And it is a constant flow of information and challenges and issues. That is truer now than it has ever been, partly because of the nature of information and the interconnection between regions of the world. If you were President 50 years ago, the tragedy in Syria might not even penetrate what the American people were thinking about on a day-to-day basis. Today, they’re seeing vivid images of a child in the aftermath of a bombing. There was a time when if you had a financial crisis in Southeast Asia somewhere, it had no impact on our markets; today it does. So the amount of information, the amount of incoming that any Administration has to deal with today -- and respond to much more rapidly than ever before -- that makes it different. I was watching a documentary, that during the Bay of Pigs crisis, JFK had about two weeks before anybody reported on it. Imagine that. I think it’s fair to say that if something like that happens under a current President, they’ve got to figure out in about an hour what their response is. So these are the kinds of points that I shared with the President-elect. It was a free-flowing and, I think, useful conversation. I hope it was. I tried to be as honest as I could about the things I think any President coming in needs to think about. And probably the most important point that I made was that how you staff -- particularly your chief of staff, your national security advisor, your White House counsel -- how you set up a process and a system to surface information, generate options for a President, understanding that ultimately the President is going to be the final decision-maker, that that’s something that has to be attended to right away. I have been blessed by having -- and I admittedly am biased -- some of the smartest, hardest-working, good people in my Administration that I think any President has ever had. And as a consequence of that team, I’ve been able to make good decisions. And if you don’t have that around you, then you’ll get swamped. So I hope that he appreciated that advice. What I also discussed was the fact that I had been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity and his interest in being the President for all people, and that how he staffs, the first steps he takes, the first impressions he makes, the reset that can happen after an election -- all those things are important and should be thought about. And I think it’s important to give him the room and the space to do that. It takes time to put that together. But I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter. And how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns, I think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he’s actually taken office.","Well, thank you. It's good to see you, too. That's a mighty fine question, and it's one I've thought about a good deal over the years.

The learning curve for the presidency... it's like nothing else, I'll tell ya. You can read all the books, listen to all the briefings, talk to all the wise old hands, but until you're actually sitting in that chair, with the weight of the world – and I mean the *entire* world – on your shoulders, making those decisions, it's a different ballgame altogether. You hit the ground running, and you just keep running. There's no time for a slow ramp-up. The challenges come at you whether you're ready or not.

As for being ""fully at ease"" in the job, I don't know if ""ease"" is quite the right word. You're never truly at ease when you know the stakes are so high, when every decision you make affects millions of lives, both here and abroad. But you do grow into it. You learn to trust your instincts, you learn to trust the good men and women you put around you. You learn to filter out the noise and focus on what truly matters.

For me, I'd say that period where you're constantly absorbing, constantly adapting... it takes a good solid year, maybe more, to really feel like you've found your rhythm. And then, just when you think you've got a handle on things, something completely unprecedented happens, and you're learning all over again. You're always learning. It's a humbling experience, always reminding you how much more there is to know, how much more there is to do. You find your footing, you find your voice, and you become the decision-maker the country needs you to be.

And yes, absolutely, I had a good long chat with President-elect Trump. You offer advice, you share experiences. You tell 'em that the job is bigger than any one person, bigger than any party. You tell him to listen, to stay grounded, and that the decisions you make affect millions, billions even. Every president, Republican or Democrat, has a responsibility to help the next one prepare as best they can, because at the end of the day, it's about the country, not the party. It's a sacred trust."
 And how long did it take before you were at ease in the job? ,"Well, I didn't really have time to worry about being at ease, because you’ll recall we were losing about 800,000 jobs a month. So the good news is that in some ways my experience is atypical. It’s hard to find an analogous situation. By the time FDR came into office, the Depression had been going on for a couple of years. We were in the midst of a free fall. The financial system was locking up. The auto industry was about to go belly up. The housing market had entirely collapsed. So one of the advantages that I had was that I was too busy to worry about how acclimated I was feeling in the job. We just had to make a bunch of decisions. In this situation, we're turning over a country that has challenges, has problems, and obviously there are people out there who are feeling deeply disaffected -- otherwise, we wouldn’t have had the results that we had in the election. On the other hand, if you look at the basic indicators of where the country is right now, the unemployment rate is as low as it’s been in eight, nine years. Incomes and wages have both gone up over the last year faster than they have in a decade or two. We've got historically low uninsured rates. The financial systems are stable. The stock market is hovering around its all-time high, and 401(k)s have been restored. The housing market has recovered. We have challenges internationally, but our most immediate challenge with respect to ISIL, we're seeing significant progress in Iraq, and Mosul is now increasingly being retaken by Iraqi security forces supported by us. Our alliances are in strong shape. The progress we've made with respect to carbon emissions has been greater than any country on Earth. And gas is two bucks a gallon. So he will have time and space I think to make judicious decisions. The incoming Administration doesn't have to put out a huge number of fires. They may want to take the country in a significantly different direction, but they've got time to consider what exactly they want to achieve. And that's a testament to the tremendous work that my team has done over the last eight years. I’m very proud of them for it. Athena Jones.","""At ease""? That's an interesting way to put it.

Nobody's ever truly ""at ease"" when you're the Commander-in-Chief. You're making decisions that affect millions, that shape history, and you've got to take that very seriously.

Now, I came in with executive experience, as Governor of Texas, so I wasn't exactly wet behind the ears. I knew how to lead. But the presidency is a whole different beast. The scale, the international stage, the constant demands... it's just enormous.

You learn the rhythm of the White House, how to work with the team, how to get the best advice from your cabinet, how to make those tough calls under pressure. You get comfortable with the *process* of leading and making decisions, that's for sure. I'd say within the first six months, you've definitely got your sea legs. You know where all the buttons are, so to speak.

But that weight of responsibility? That never really goes away. And frankly, it shouldn't. You need to feel that to do the job right, to always be sharp, always thinking about the American people. So, maybe 'comfortable in the chair' after a few months, learning the ropes. But 'at ease'? That's a luxury the President doesn't really get. And if they do, they're probably not doing the job properly."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You said more than once that you do not believe that Donald Trump would ever be elected President, and that you thought he was unfit for the office. Now that you've spent time with him, sitting down and talking to him for an hour and a half in the Oval Office, do you now think that President-elect Trump is qualified to be President? And if I can do a compound question, the other one is you mentioned staffing and tone. What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments that were expressed by President-elect Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I’m talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the so-called alt-right movement, what many call the white nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under President Trump as his chief strategist and senior advisor. What message does that send to the country, to the world? ","Athena, without copping out, I think it’s fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the President-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we're going to try to facilitate a smooth transition. Look, the people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next President, the 45th President of the United States. And it will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflect his policies. And those who didn’t vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works. That's how this system operates. When I won, there were a number of people who didn’t like me and didn’t like what I stood for. And I think that whenever you've got an incoming President of the other side, particularly in a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality. Hopefully it's a reminder that elections matter and voting counts. And so I don’t know how many times we have to relearn this lesson, because we ended up having 43 percent of the country not voting who were eligible to vote. But it makes a difference. So given that President-elect Trump is now trying to balance what he said in the campaign and the commitments he made to his supporters with working with those who disagreed with him, and members of Congress, and reaching out to constituencies that didn’t vote for him, I think it's important for us to let him make his decisions. And I think the American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see, and whether these are the kinds of policies and this is the direction that they want to see the country go in. And my role is to make sure that when I hand off this White House that it is in the best possible shape and that I've been as helpful as I can to him in going forward and building on the progress that we've made. And my advice, as I said, to the President-elect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing. I think he recognizes that. I think he's sincere in wanting to be a successful President and moving this country forward. And I don’t think any President ever comes in saying to themselves, I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country. I think he's going to try as best he can to make sure that he delivers, not only for the people who voted for him, but for the people at large. And the good thing is, is that there are going to be elections coming up, so there's a built-in incentive for him to try to do that. But it's only been six days. And I think it will be important for him to have the room to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical, what he can actually achieve. There are certain things that make for good sound bites but don’t translate into good policy. And that's something that he and his team, I think, will wrestle with, in the same way that every President wrestles with. I did say to him, as I've said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaigns, and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns, that it's really important to try to send some signals of unity, and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign. And I think that's something that he will want to do. But this is all happening real fast. 0 He's got commitments to supporters that helped to get him here, and he's going to have to balance those. And over the coming weeks and months and years, my hope is, is that those impulses ultimately win out. But it's a little too early to start making judgments on that.","Well, thank you for the question. A couple of very important points there.

First, on President-elect Trump's qualifications, look, this is the toughest job in the world. I've said that many times. And when you sit down in that Oval Office, when you talk about the weight of the responsibilities, the global challenges, the domestic needs, it brings a clarity to anyone who steps into that role.

I had a good, substantive conversation with the President-elect. We talked about the transition, about the incredible demands of the office. What I can tell you is that he is now squarely focused on putting his team together and on understanding the mechanisms of government. That, in itself, is a tremendous undertaking for any incoming president.

Being President is not something you're born into; it's something you learn, day by day, decision by decision. It requires an ability to listen, to learn, to adapt, and most importantly, to lead all Americans. I offered him my best counsel, just as previous presidents offered it to me, because we all want to see our country succeed. The success of any president is the success of America.

Now, on your second question, about the concerns of many Americans, particularly minorities, and about the tone and appointments like Mr. Bannon. I completely understand why there's anxiety out there. This has been a very divisive election, and many people are feeling unheard, or even targeted.

Our strength as a nation has always been in our diversity, in our commitment to the idea that every person, no matter their background, their faith, their race, their gender, has a place at the table and is protected under our Constitution. The President of the United States has a sacred obligation to represent all Americans, to heal divisions, and to ensure that the tone emanating from the White House is one of unity and respect for everyone.

When it comes to staffing decisions, those are ultimately up to the President-elect. But I believe it is absolutely critical that any administration, especially in the highest office, reflects the broad tapestry of America. It must send a clear message, both at home and abroad, that our nation stands for tolerance, for inclusion, and for the fundamental rights and dignity of every individual.

Ultimately, the actions and policies of the new administration will be the true measure. It falls on President-elect Trump to rise to the occasion, to address these anxieties directly, and to demonstrate through his governance that he will be a president for all Americans, upholding those bedrock principles that make our country special."
 And your view of his qualifications. Has that changed after meeting with him? ,"I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him, and he's going to win -- he has won. He's going to be the next President. And regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up. And those aspects of his positions or predispositions that don’t match up with reality he will find shaken up pretty quick, because reality has a way of asserting itself. And some of his gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest political upsets in history -- those are ones that hopefully he will put to good use on behalf of all the American people. Scott Horsley.","Well, you know, it depends on who you're talking about, because there are a lot of people out there, frankly, with very low qualifications. Believe me. But if we're talking about *someone important*, someone I've actually *met*... look, my view on qualifications is very simple: Are you smart? Are you a winner? Do you love America? Can you get deals done? A lot of these folks, they have these fancy degrees, they talk a big game, they've been in Washington for years, but they don't *do* anything. They're all talk, no action. Sad!

Now, if I meet someone, and I usually have a pretty good read, a *tremendous* read, frankly, on people before I even walk into the room... sometimes, yes, you meet them, you look them in the eye, you shake their hand, and you realize they're either even better than you thought – a really sharp individual, a true patriot, a negotiator – or, more often, they're exactly what I thought: a lightweight. A lot of these folks, they don't have the temperament, they don't have the smarts, they don't have the stamina. Meeting them often just confirms it. It's very clear. Very, very clear. My instincts are usually right."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You’re off to Europe, which is facing some of the same populous pressures we see at work in this country. When you spoke at the U.N., you talked about the choice we're facing between integration and building walls. What choice do you think the American people made last week? And is there still a chance for what you called a course correction before Europeans make some of their choices? ","I think the American people recognize that the world has shrunk, that it’s interconnected, that you’re not going to put that genie back in the bottle. The American people recognize that their careers, or their kids’ careers are going to have to be more dynamic -- that they might not be working at a single plant for 30 years, but they might have to change careers. They might have to get more education. They might have to retool or retrain. And I think the American people are game for that. They want to make sure that the rules of the game are fair. And what that means is that if you look at surveys around Americans’ attitudes on trade, the majority of the American people still support trade. 1 But they’re concerned about whether or not trade is fair, and whether we’ve got the same access to other countries’ markets as they have with us; is there just a race to the bottom when it comes to wages, and so forth. Now, I made an argument -- thus far, unsuccessfully -- that the trade deal we had organized, TPP, did exactly that, that it strengthened workers’ rights and environmental rights, leveled the playing field and, as a consequences, would be good for American workers and American businesses. But that’s a complex argument to make when people remember plants closing and jobs being offshored. So part of what I think this election reflected was people wanting that course correction that you described. And the message around stopping surges of immigration, not creating new trade deals that may be unfair -- I think those were themes that played a prominent role in the campaign. As we now shift to governing, my argument is that we do need to make sure that we have an orderly, lawful immigration process, but that if it is orderly and lawful, immigration is good for our economy. It keeps this country young. It keeps it dynamic. We have entrepreneurs and strivers who come here and are willing to take risks. And that’s part of the reason why America, historically, has been successful. It’s part of the reason why our economy is stronger and better positioned than most of our other competitors, is because we got a younger population that’s more dynamic. When it comes to trade, I think when you’re governing, it will become increasingly apparent that if you were to just eliminate trade deals with Mexico, for example, well, you’ve got a global supply chain. The parts that are allowing auto plants that were about to shut down to now employ double shifts is because they’re bringing in some of those parts to assemble out of Mexico. And so it’s not as simple as it might have seemed. And the key for us -- when I say “us,” I mean Americans, but I think particularly for progressives -- is to say your concerns are real, your anxieties are real; here’s how we fix them: Higher minimum wage. Stronger worker protections so workers have more leverage to get a bigger piece of the pie. Stronger financial regulations, not weaker ones. 2 Yes to trade, but trade that ensures that these other countries that trade with us aren’t engaging in child labor, for example. Being attentive to inequality and not tone deaf to it, but offering prescriptions that are actually going to help folks that are in communities that feel forgotten. That’s going to be our most important strategy. And I think we can successfully do that. People will still be looking to the United States. Our example will still carry great weight. And it continues to be my strong belief that the way we are going to make sure that everybody feels a part of this global economy is not by shutting ourselves off from each other even if we could, but rather by working together more effectively than we have in the past. Martha Raddatz.","Thank you very much. Good question. A very important question, actually.

Look, what I said at the U.N. was very clear, and it’s very simple: Every nation has a right to its borders, and every nation has a right to put its own people FIRST. When you talk about integration versus building walls, it's not really a choice for *or* against; it's a choice for common sense. For national security. For sovereignty. For making sure your own citizens are protected, that their jobs are protected, that their culture is protected.

And what choice did the American people make last week? They made a tremendous choice. They made a choice for America First. They made a choice for strong borders. They made a choice for prosperity and for jobs coming back to our country. They want leaders who are going to fight for them, who are going to secure our nation, and who are going to make America great again. That's what they voted for, and that's exactly what we're delivering.

Now, for Europe, yes, they're facing tremendous pressures, tremendous challenges. And I've been telling them this for a long time. Some of these countries, they've been very, very unwise, frankly, in how they've handled things. The course correction? Believe me, America *is* the course correction. We are showing the world that you can be strong, you can be sovereign, you can put your citizens first, and you can still have incredible alliances, incredible trade. But it has to be fair. And you have to protect your own. So, yes, there's absolutely a chance for Europe to make its own course correction. They're watching us, they're seeing what we're doing. They see the success. And many of them, I think, will make the right choice. They have to. They have to for their own countries. Thank you."
" Thanks, Mr. President. We heard some of the harsh words you had about Mr. Trump, calling him “temperamentally unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.” Did anything surprise you about President-elect Trump when you met with him in your office? And also I want to know, does anything concern you about a Trump presidency? ","Well, we had a very cordial conversation. And that didn't surprise me to some degree because I think that he is obviously a gregarious person. He’s somebody who I think likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate. And what’s clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxiety, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive. And I said so to him, because I think that to the extent that there were a lot of folks who missed the Trump phenomenon, I think that connection that he was able to make with his supporters that was impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate, that's powerful stuff. I also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other Presidents might be arriving with. I don't think he is ideological. I think ultimately he’s pragmatic in that way. And that can serve him well, as long as he’s got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction. 3 Do I have concerns? Absolutely. Of course, I’ve got concerns. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues. But the federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat, it’s an ocean liner -- as I discovered when I came into office. It took a lot of really hard work for us to make significant policy changes -- even in our first two years, when we had larger majorities than Mr. Trump will enjoy when he comes into office. And one of the things I advised him to do was to make sure that before he commits to certain courses of action, he’s really dug in and thought through how various issues play themselves out. I’ll use an obvious example where we have a difference, but it will be interesting to see what happens in the coming year, and that's the Affordable Care Act. So obviously this has been the Holy Grail for Republicans over the last six, seven years -- was “we've got to kill Obamacare.” Now, that has been taken as an article of faith -- that this is terrible, it doesn’t work and we have to undo it. But now that Republicans are in charge, they got to take a look and say, let's see, we got 20 million people who have health insurance who didn’t have it before; health care costs generally have gone up at a significantly slower rate since Obamacare was passed than they did before, which has saved the federal Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars; people who have health insurance are benefitting in all sorts of ways that they may not be aware of -- everything from no longer having lifetime limits on the claims that they can make, to seniors getting prescription drug discounts under Medicare, to free mammograms. Now, it's one thing to characterize this thing as not working when it's just an abstraction. Now, suddenly, you're in charge and you're going to repeal it. Okay, well, what happens to those 20 million people who have health insurance? Are you going to just kick them off and suddenly they don’t have health insurance? And in what ways are their lives better because of that? Are you going to repeal the provision that ensures that if you do have health insurance on your job, and you lose your job or you change jobs or you start a small business that you're not discriminated against because you've got a preexisting condition? That's really popular. How are you going to replace it? Are you going to change the policy that kids can stay on their parents' health insurance plan until they're 26? How are you going to approach all these issues? 4 Now, my view is that if they can come up with something better that actually works, and a year or two after they've replaced the Affordable Care Act with their own plan, that 25 million people have health insurance, and it's cheaper and better and running smoothly, I'll be the first one to say, that's great -- congratulations. If, on the other hand, whatever they're proposing results in millions of people losing coverage, and results in people who already have health insurance losing protections that were contained in the legislation, then we're going to have a problem. And I think that's not going to be unique to me; I think the American people will respond that way. So I think on a lot of issues, what you're going to see is now comes the hard part. Now is governance. We are going to be able to present to the incoming Administration a country that is stronger, a federal government that is working better and more efficiently; a national security apparatus that is both more effective and truer to our values; energy policies that are resulting in not just less pollution, but also more jobs. And I think the President-elect, rightly, would expect that he's judged on whether we improve from that baseline and on those metrics, or things get worse. And if things get worse, then the American people will figure that out pretty quick. And if things get better, then more power to him. And I'll be the first to congratulate him.","Well, thank you. You know, campaigns are tough affairs, and I've always believed in speaking my mind, especially when it comes to the gravitas of the presidency. My comments during the campaign were about the immense weight of the office, about the kind of temperament I believe is essential for a Commander-in-Chief who has to make decisions that affect the lives of every American and, frankly, the peace of the world. It's a job that demands a steady hand and a clear head.

As for meeting with President-elect Trump in the Oval Office, we had a good, frank discussion. And yes, there were some things that struck me. I think what surprised me, in a positive way, was a certain seriousness about the job. When you sit in that chair, when you're looking at the seal, it's a different feeling than being on the campaign trail. There was a recognition, I believe, of the immense responsibilities that lie ahead, and he listened intently to what I had to say about the challenges, both domestic and abroad. It’s one thing to talk about leading, it’s another to sit down and truly grasp the scale of the task.

Regarding concerns, look, the presidency is the toughest job in the world. My concern, for any president, and certainly for President-elect Trump, is that he surrounds himself with wise counsel, people who will tell him the truth, even when it's inconvenient. This job requires careful deliberation, a deep understanding of history, and the ability to unite a country that often feels divided. It demands humility and a recognition that you serve all Americans, not just the ones who voted for you. The world is a complex place, and leading the free world requires not just strength, but also prudence, and a profound respect for our institutions. I believe in the resilience of American democracy, and my hope is that he will rise to the demands of this incredible office."
" Mr. President, you had talked specifically about his temperament. Do you still have any concern about his temperament? ","As I said -- because, Athena asked the question -- whatever you bring to this office, this office has a habit of magnifying and pointing out, and hopefully then you correct for it. This may seem like a silly example, but I know myself well enough to know I can't keep track of paper. I am not well organized in that way. And so pretty quickly, after I'm getting stacks of briefing books coming in every night, I say to myself, I've got to figure out a system because I have bad filing, sorting and organizing habits. And I've got to find some people who can help me keep track of this stuff. That seems trivial, but actually it ends up being a pretty big piece of business. 5 I think what will happen with the President-elect is there are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them. Because when you're a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial, it has less impact than it does when you're President of the United States. Everybody around the world is paying attention. Markets move. National security issues require a level of precision in order to make sure that you don't make mistakes. And I think he recognizes that this is different, and so do the American people. All right, I'm going to take just a couple more questions and then I get out of here. Nadia Bilbassy.","Temperament? You know, people talk about temperament, and frankly, some people just don't understand what it takes to lead. What *I* see is a very strong individual, someone who's not afraid to fight for what's right. He's got incredible resolve. Some people, the fake news, they call that temperament. I call it strength. We need strength. We don't need weak people, we don't need people who buckle. He's tough, he's smart, he gets the job done. So, concern? No, not when it means getting results. It's a winner's temperament, frankly. The best."
" Thank you, Mr. President. President-elect Trump threatened to unravel the Iran nuclear deal that your Administration worked very hard to get. What would be a concern if he alters part of it? And what would your advice be, considering that he said he’s open to advice? And on Syria, sir, the Syrian regime now is threatening Aleppo with massive destruction. You spoke passionately a few years back about Benghazi and you warned against the killing of civilians there. Many people criticized your Administration for the shortcoming of the Syria policy. Are you willing to admit any fault under your watch? And how do you act with President-elect Trump says that he won't support the Syrian opposition? Thank you. ","Iran is a good example of the gap I think between some of the rhetoric in this town -- not unique to the President-elect -- and the reality. I think there was a really robust debate about the merits of the Iran deal before it was completed. And I actually was pretty proud of how our democracy processed that. It was a serious debate. I think people of goodwill were on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, we were able to persuade members of Congress and the public -- at least enough of them -- to support it. At the time, the main argument against it was Iran wouldn’t abide by the deal, that they would cheat. We now have over a year of evidence that they have abided by the agreement. That's not just my opinion, it's not just people in my Administration. That's the opinion of Israeli military and intelligence officers who are part of a government that vehemently opposed the deal. 6 So my suspicion is, is that when the President-elect comes in, and he’s consulting with his Republican colleagues on the Hill, that they will look at the facts. Because to unravel a deal that's working and preventing Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapon would be hard to explain - - particularly if the alternative were to have them freed from any obligations and go ahead and pursue a weapon. And keep in mind this is not just an international agreement between us and the Iranians; this is between the P5+1, other countries, some of our closest allies. And for us to pull out would then require us to start sanctioning those other countries in Europe or China or Russia that were still abiding by the deal because, from their perspective, Iran had done what it was supposed to do. So it becomes more difficult I think to undo something that’s working than undo something that isn’t working. And when you’re not responsible for it, I think you can call it a terrible deal. When you are responsible for the deal and preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, you’re more likely to look at the facts. That is going to be true in other circumstances. For example, the Paris agreement. There’s been a lot of talk about the possibility of undoing this international agreement. Now, you’ve got 200 countries that have signed up to this thing. And the good news is that what we’ve been able to show over the last five, six, eight years is that it’s possible to grow the economy really fast and possible to bring down carbon emissions as well. It’s not just a bunch of rules that we’ve set up. You’ve got utilities that are putting in solar panels and creating jobs. You’ve got the Big Three automakers who have seen record sales and are overachieving on the fuel efficiency standards that we set. Turns out that people like not having to fill up as often and save money at the pump, even if it’s good for the environment. You’ve got states like California that have been moving forward on a clean energy agenda separate and apart from any federal regulations that have been put forward. In fact, 40 percent of the country already lives under -- in states that are actively pursuing what’s embodied in the Paris agreement and the Clean Power Plan rule. 7 And even states like Texas that politically tend to oppose me -- you’ve seen huge increases in wind power and solar power. And you’ve got some of the country’s biggest companies, like Google and Walmart, all pursuing energy efficiency because it’s good for their bottom line. So what we’ve been able to do is to embed a lot of these practices into how our economy works. And it’s made our economy more efficient, it’s helped the bottom line of folks, and it’s cleaned up the environment. What the Paris agreement now does is say to China and India and other countries that are potentially polluting, come onboard; let’s work together so you guys do the same thing. And the biggest threat when it comes to climate change and pollution isn’t going to come from us -- because we only have 300 million people. It’s going to come from China, with over a billion people, and India, with over a billion people. And if they are pursuing the same kinds of strategies that we did before we became more aware of the environment, then our kids will be choked off. And so, again, do I think that the new Administration will make some changes? Absolutely. But these international agreements, the tradition has been that you carry them forward across Administrations, particularly if, once you actually examine them, it turns out that they’re doing good for us and binding other countries into behavior that will help us. Last question. Justin Sink.","Well, thank you for that, and it's good to speak with you all. These are weighty matters, and the President-elect has a lot on his plate.

Regarding the **Iran nuclear deal**, my administration certainly had strong views on the Iranian regime. We designated them as part of an Axis of Evil for a reason. They're a state sponsor of terror, and they represent a grave threat to stability and our allies in the region. Now, the agreement reached by the previous administration was a complex one, and it generated a lot of debate. If President-elect Trump chooses to alter it, my primary concern, as always, would be ensuring that Iran absolutely, positively, does not acquire a nuclear weapon. That's paramount. Any change would need to be part of a very clear strategy to prevent that outcome and to counter Iran's other destabilizing activities in the region. You don't want to inadvertently provide them an easier path.

My advice to the President-elect, since he's open to it, would be this: Always remember the gravity of these decisions. Consult widely, listen to our intelligence professionals, and work closely with our allies. They often have crucial insights and stakes in these situations. Whatever path you choose, Mr. President-elect, make sure it's based on solid intelligence, a clear objective, and a deep understanding of the consequences, both intended and unintended. Stand firm, but be smart.

Now, on **Syria** and the tragedy unfolding in Aleppo... I spoke passionately about protecting civilians in Benghazi, and indeed, I've always believed that the civilized world has a moral obligation to condemn atrocities against innocent people. What we are witnessing in Aleppo, the deliberate targeting of civilians, the use of barrel bombs, the destruction – it is a humanitarian catastrophe of the highest order. It breaks my heart to see.

As for admitting fault under my watch regarding Syria, well, the major crisis we see today, with the civil war and the rise of ISIS, largely erupted after I left office. However, I'd be the first to say that leadership in the Middle East is always fraught with challenges. The region is incredibly complex, and finding the right balance between American ideals, American interests, and the limits of American power is a constant struggle for any president. Every leader faces difficult choices, and hindsight always offers a clearer view than the fog of decision-making. We always acted with what we believed was the best interest of our country and the cause of freedom at heart. The seeds of instability were present long before, and every administration grapples with how to foster democracy and stability in a region prone to authoritarianism and extremism.

When President-elect Trump says he won't support the Syrian opposition, that's a significant shift in policy. How do you act? Well, first, you have to understand *why* he's making that decision. Is it because of the entanglement with extremist groups, a focus on fighting ISIS directly, or a desire to avoid what some see as a quagmire? America needs a coherent strategy in Syria, one that protects our national security, counters radical Islamic terrorism, and addresses the humanitarian crisis. If the opposition is not supported, then what is the alternative? Does it lead to Assad consolidating power, and what are the long-term implications of that for regional stability and our allies? These are the questions that the President-elect will need to answer, and it will require careful deliberation and clear-eyed assessments of the consequences. America must lead, but we must do so with prudence and purpose."
" Sir, on Syria. ","I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Okay, you’re right. You are right about that. With respect to Syria -- in Benghazi, we had an international mandate. We had a U.N. Security resolution. We had a broad-based coalition, and we were able to carry out a support mission that achieved the initial goal of preventing Benghazi from being slaughtered fairly quickly. It’s no secret -- you know this region well -- that Syria is a much more messy situation, with proxies coming from every direction. 8 And so I wish that I could bring this to a halt immediately. We have made every effort to try to bring about a political resolution to this challenge. John Kerry has spent an infinite amount of time trying to negotiate with Russians and Iranians and Gulf States and other parties to try to end the killing there. But if what you’re asking is do we have the capacity to carry out the same kinds of military actions in Syria that we did in Libya, the situation is obviously different. We don’t have that option easily available to us. And so we’re going to have to continue to try to pursue, as best we can, a political solution and, in the interim, put as much pressure as we can on the parties to arrive at humanitarian safe spaces and ceasefires that at least alleviate the suffering that’s on the ground. I recognize that that has not worked. And it is something that I continue to think about every day, and we continue to try to find some formula that would allow us to see that suffering end. But I think it’s not surprising to you, because you study this deeply, that if you have a Syrian military that is committed to killing its people indiscriminately, as necessary, and it is supported by Russia that now have substantial military assets on the ground and are actively supporting that regime, and Iran actively supporting that regime, and we are supporting what has to be our number-one national security priority, which is going after ISIL both in Mosul and ultimately in Raqqa -- that the situation is not the same as it was in Libya. And obviously there are some who question the steps we took in Libya. I continue to believe that was the right thing to do, although, as I indicated before, in the aftermath of that campaign, I think the world community did not sufficiently support the need for some sort of security structures there and now is a situation that we have to get back into a better place. I’ve given you -- last question is Justin Sink of Bloomberg.","Syria. Look, it's a total disaster, a mess that was left to us, frankly. A situation that should have been handled differently a long, long time ago.

Remember the red line? Big talk, no action. Tremendous talk, and then nothing happened. Absolutely nothing. That created a vacuum, a very dangerous situation where ISIS was running wild, taking over huge sections, and nobody knew what to do about it.

We came in, and we did what needed to be done. We wiped out ISIS, 100% of the caliphate. We did that. And when Assad used those horrible chemical weapons, against his own people, nobody thought we would do anything. But we hit him, and we hit him hard. We showed strength. We showed that America means business.

But here's the thing: we're bringing our soldiers home. We don't want to be the world's policeman forever, spending trillions of dollars and getting absolutely nothing in return except for endless wars. We've secured the oil – very important, the oil – but we're getting out.

Let other people fight their own wars. We've done an incredible job, a truly incredible job, defeating ISIS and stabilizing things as much as you can in that part of the world. It's a tough place, believe me. A very tough place. We're getting our great military out and focusing on America. America First. That's what it's all about."
" Thank you very much. Mr. President, you and the President-elect have very different views on Russia. After your meeting with him last week, can you assure Chancellor Merkel that a Trump Administration would also support strong sanctions against Moscow? Similarly, what have you told President Putin about Russia's influence on the U.S. election? And how would you advise European countries to deal with the same threat? And lastly, if I may, would you like to see your friend, Chancellor Merkel, run for reelection next year? [Speaks German.] ","Uh-oh. Pull out your German, showing off.","Well, thank you very much. I appreciate the question, and these are important matters for the security of the United States and for our friends and allies around the world.

First, regarding Chancellor Merkel and the issue of sanctions... My job as President, and what I have always believed, is that America stands by its commitments and by its allies. We believe in the rule of law and in upholding international norms. Sanctions are a tool, and they have been used when actions are taken that undermine stability and the sovereignty of nations. I have confidence in the strength of our institutions and our transatlantic alliances. The next administration will make its own decisions, of course, but I've always emphasized the enduring importance of a strong, unified front against aggression and for freedom. We stand with those who seek it.

Regarding President Putin and any influence on our elections... I have always been very clear with President Putin, and with any world leader, that the United States is a sovereign nation. We choose our own path, and our elections are a matter for the American people. I've consistently emphasized the importance of respecting democratic processes, and that any interference is unacceptable. America's democracy is strong, and it will endure because it is built on the will of the people.

For our European friends who might be facing similar threats... the key, in my view, is solidarity. It's about strengthening our own democratic institutions, enhancing intelligence sharing, and standing together, united in our common values. When we speak with one voice, when we are committed to open societies and freedom, we are stronger. These are challenges that democracies must face head-on, and we face them best when we face them together.

And finally, Chancellor Merkel... Angela is a strong leader, a good friend, and a steady hand. She has served Germany with dignity and resolve during some very challenging times. Whether she runs for re-election next year, that is a decision for her and for the German people to make, and I respect that. But I have a great deal of admiration for her leadership and her character."
" [As interpreted.] Has the American President calmed you in the sense that on the policy of his successor on climate change and Russia -- he has allayed your fears? And are you concerned that the common European policy towards Russia will collapse? And after the election of Mr. Trump, would you -- as a sign of civility, wouldn't you actually have to declare that you are going to be a candidate again? ","Well, I try to make it a rule not to meddle in other people's politics. All I can say is that Chancellor Merkel has been an outstanding partner. And Chancellor Merkel is perhaps the only leader left among our closest allies that was there when I arrived, so, in some ways, we are now the veterans of many challenges over the last eight years. And although we have not always been in sync on every issue, in terms of our core values, in terms of her integrity, her truthfulness, her thoughtfulness, her doing her homework, knowing her facts, her commitment to looking out for the interests of the German people first, but recognizing that part of good leadership on behalf of the nation requires engaging the world as a whole and participating effectively in multilateral institutions, I think she's been outstanding. So it's up to her whether she wants to stand again, and then ultimately it will be up to the German people to decide what the future holds. If I were here and I were German, and I had a vote, I might support her. But I don't know whether that hurts or helps. With respect to Russia, my principal approach to Russia has been constant since I first came into office. Russia is an important country. It is a military superpower. It has influence in the region and it has influence around the world. And in order for us to solve many big problems around the world, it is in our interest to work with Russia and obtain their cooperation. I think we should all hope for a Russia that is successful, where its people are employed and the economy is growing, and they are having good relationships with their neighbors, and participating constructively on big issues like climate change. So I’ve sought a constructive relationship with Russia, but what I have also been is realistic in recognizing that there are some significant differences in how Russia views the world and how we view the world. The values that we talked about -- the values of democracy, and free speech, and international norms, and rule of law, respecting the ability of other countries to determine their own destiny and preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity -- those things are not something that we can set aside. And so on issues like Ukraine, on issues like Syria, we’ve had very significant differences. And my hope is that the President-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach, finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interests align, but that the President-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms. And I don’t expect that the President-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is, is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest that if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people, or even if it violates international norms, or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in regions like Syria -- that we just do whatever is convenient at the time. And that will be something that I think we’ll learn more about as the President-elect puts his team together. I am encouraged by the President-elect’s insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change. And his full commitment to NATO as the foundation for our international security I think is very important. And finally, in terms of my conversations with President Putin, these are conversations that took place before the election. As I indicated, there has been very clear proof that they have engaged in cyberattacks. This isn’t new. It’s not unique to Russia. There are a number of states where we’ve seen low-level cyberattacks and industrial espionage and other behavior that we think should be out of bounds. And I delivered a clear and forceful message that, though we recognize Russia’s intelligence-gathering will sometimes take place even if we don’t like it, there’s a difference between that and them either meddling with elections or going after private organizations or commercial entities, and that we’re monitoring it carefully and we will respond appropriately if and when we see this happening. I do think that this whole area of cyber is something that, at an international level, we have to work on and develop frameworks and international norms so that we don’t see a cyber arms race. A lot of countries have advanced capabilities, and given the vulnerabilities of our infrastructure and our economies to digital platforms, we have to be careful in making sure that this doesn’t become a lawless, low-level battlefield. And we’ve started trying to put together some principles that were adopted in the G20, the G7, and at the U.N. levels, but a lot more work remains to be done on that front. Chancellor Merkel: [As interpreted.] Well, allow me if I may to underline, first of all, that I’m very much impressed that, in spite of a very tough election campaign, this transition period in the United States of America, because it follows democratic principles, is working smoothly. Because this is all about the American people, it’s about the destiny of the American people, the outgoing Administration is sharing its knowledge, its expertise with the incoming Administration. And this to us is a sign of encouragement to continue the good cooperation that we have built between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany. And that is in our mutual interest. So we will continue this. I will continue this with -- I approach this with an open mind, and I’ll do it on the basis of a deep conviction with President-elect Donald Trump. Secondly, on Russia. I can only repeat what the President said previously. This is all about respecting certain principles. And I’m saying this from a European vantage point, from a German vantage point. So the fact that for over 70 years, we have been able to enjoy peace, to live in peace very much depends on territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and every European country being respected. In view of the European history, the reverse would be the start of a very bitter road down a slippery slope, and we have to nip this in the bud. We have to stand up resolutely against any such attempts. 0 But we are pinning our hopes on political efforts. This is why we launched the Normandy Process, in close coordination with the United States of America. And particularly from a German perspective, from the European perspective, I can only say again, Russia is our neighbor. Just look at Poland -- the sort of European perspective this has. So we have an interest in seeing this relationship be a good one. We have a lot of historical ties, of course, a history that we share. But this mustn’t keep us from, wherever we feel there are very grave differences of opinion, to raise them with them, but, again, with political means and always trying to work for political settlements. And this what I’m going to continue to work on with all my heart. So on the question whether I will put up a candidacy, I will do this at the appropriate time, and this is not today.","Well, now, that's a lot to unpack, isn't it? Let me take these one by one, from the perspective of someone who's had the honor of sitting in that Oval Office.

First, on whether the current President has allayed my fears regarding climate change and Russia. Look, when you've been the one making the tough calls, you always hope for the best for the country, no matter who's in charge.

On **climate change**, it's a serious issue, always has been. We have a responsibility to be good stewards of our planet for future generations. But you've got to balance that responsibility with the economic realities faced by our working families and industries. It's a delicate balance, and I'm always watching, hoping that the approach taken is one that strengthens America both environmentally and economically, without putting an undue burden on our citizens.

As for **Russia**, well, Russia's always been a challenge, and frankly, a threat when they choose to be. We learned that lesson through tough experience. My view has always been that you deal with adversaries from a position of strength, with strong alliances at your back. I certainly believe the current administration understands the gravity of the threat posed by Moscow, and I hope they continue to stand firm, with our allies, against any aggression. It's a complicated world, and that particular situation is as tricky as it gets.

Second, your question about the **common European policy towards Russia collapsing**. Absolutely, I'm concerned. The unity of our European allies, particularly through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization – NATO – that's been a cornerstone of global stability and American security for decades. We built that, we invested in it. When you see a dictator like Putin trying to pick off countries, trying to unravel the very fabric of those alliances, it's not just a European problem, it's a global threat. A divided Europe, a disunited NATO, that's a dangerous prospect for America and for the world. We need to do everything we can to reinforce that common front.

And finally, about whether *I* would declare my candidacy again after a hypothetical election of Mr. Trump, as a sign of civility... *(a soft chuckle)* Oh, now that's an interesting thought, isn't it? My friend, my time in the arena was a long time ago. The American people, they've spoken, and they'll speak again. My role now, like many former presidents, is to lend my voice to the causes I believe in, to support our institutions, and to offer whatever wisdom I've gained, without getting back into the daily cut-and-thrust of electoral politics. Civility, to me, means respecting the process, respecting the voters' decisions, and letting the next generation lead. I've had my turn, and I'm mighty proud of the work we did. But a new candidacy? I think I'll leave that to the younger folks."
" Mr. President, your country is divided. You, as first black President, as first African American President, who did so many things so differently, who raised so much hope all over the world -- do you think that you have, perhaps in a way, put too much of a strain, maybe too much of demands on the Americans? And to what extent do you think your successor may well be a threat to the rest of the world, to the security? Because there are, after all, nuclear weapons here in Germany to which he has access now. Will you want to now, Madam Chancellor, see to it under the your Administration try to make Europe and Germany less dependent on the United States? And are you afraid of this wave of populism hitting Germany, hitting Europe, as well? And a personal question. President Obama paid tribute to you as an outstanding politician. You are somewhat more sober when you describe your partner. How difficult is it for you to take leave today of your partner? ","My guiding principle as President has been to try to do the right thing even when it’s not politically convenient; to look at long term trends in our economy, in our society, in the international sphere, and, using my best judgment, shape policies that will serve the American people, keep them safe, keep our economy growing, put people back to work, and best ensure peace, cooperation, and stability around the world. 1 And based on current surveys of public opinion in the United States, it turns out that the majority of Americans think I’ve done a pretty good job, that we haven’t, in fact, gone too fast, as you describe it. But what is certainly true is that the American people -- just like the German people, just like the British, and people around the world -- are seeing extraordinarily rapid change. The world is shrinking. Economies have become much more integrated, and demographics are shifting. Because of the Internet and communications, the clash of cultures is much more direct. People feel, I think, less certain about their identity, less certain about economic security. They’re looking for some means of control. And what that means is, is that the politics in all of our countries is going to require us to manage technology and global integration and all these demographic shifts in a way that makes people feel more control, that gives them more confidence in their future, but does not resort to simplistic answers or divisions of race or tribe, or the crude nationalism, which I think can be contrasted to the pride of patriotism that we all feel about our respective countries. And I think that our politics everywhere are going to be going through this bumpy phase. But as long as we stay true to our democratic principles, as long as elections have integrity, as long as we respect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, as long as there are checks and balances in our governments so that the people have the ability to not just make judgments about how well government is serving them but also change governments if they're not serving them well -- then I have confidence that over the long term, progress will continue. And I think it’s especially important for those of us who believe in a world where we're interdependent, that believes in mutual interests and mutual respect between nations, it’s particularly important that we reach out to everybody in our countries -- those who feel disaffected, those who feel left behind by globalization -- and address their concerns in constructive ways, as opposed to more destructive ways. And I think that can be done. But it’s hard. It requires creativity. It requires effective communications. Part of what’s changed in politics is social media and how people are receiving information. It’s easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies. But we’ll figure it out. 2 So, ultimately, I remain optimistic about not just America’s future, but the direction that the world is going in. And part of what makes me most optimistic is if you look at the attitudes of young people. Across the board, young people are much more comfortable with respecting differences. They are much more comfortable with diversity. They are much less likely to express attitudes that divide us between “us” and “them.” They see themselves as part of a global economy that they can navigate successfully, and are showing enormous creativity and entrepreneurship and working with each other across borders. So that's where the future is. But we have to create that bridge to the future. And that means making sure we're paying attention to the wages of workers in countries and making sure that we're investing in their education and their skills, that we are growing the economy in smart ways and rebuilding our infrastructure and investing in science and development, and that we stay true to those values that helped get us here. And if we do that, I think we're going to be fine. Chancellor Merkel: [As interpreted.] On the issue first of independence of Germany, after the time of national socialism, Germany has been given an enormous amount of help, particularly and also from the United States of America. The fact that we were able to enjoy German unification is due first and foremost to the help of the United States of America. And ever since Germany was able to regain its unity, it is in an even stronger position to give its contribution to upholding this order to which we feel committed, and for which particularly people in the German Democratic Republic stood out there in the streets to keep this up, to maintain this order, particularly also in our country. Now, we're trying to do more than it used to be 26 years ago. And there are a number of other areas where we have to also make a stronger contribution. We will all have to do more in development cooperation. It's important that these disparities in the living conditions cannot be allowed in this digital period to be too marked. Each and every one must be given an opportunity to participate -- which is why Germany's fate, in many ways, depends on the firmness of its alliance with NATO, with the European Union. We cannot stand alone with 80 million people. In this world of today, you cannot, when you just stand on your own, achieve much -- even though you may be economically strong. So alliances are part of our destiny as a nation, part of our future as a nation. And this is what guides me in my policy, what guides my government as a whole. 3 Secondly, this wave of populism that seems to engulf us, well, look at -- and it seems, in your words, to come from the United States. Look at the European Parliament. There are a lot of people who are looking for simplistic solutions, who are sort of preaching policies of -- well, very unfriendly policies. We have them here in Europe, too. We have them here in Germany, too. And to take up where the President left off, digitization is, in a way, a disruptive force, a disruptive technological force that brings about deep-seated change, transformation of a society. Look at the history of the printing press -- when this was invented, what sort of consequences this had. Or industrialization -- what sort of consequences that had. Very often it led to enormous transformational processes within individual societies, and it took a while until societies learned how to find the right kind of policies to contain this and to manage and steer this. And I think we live in a period of profound transformation, very similar to when we had a translation from agricultural societies to industrial societies. Now, when we, for example, see shifts of huge production lines from certain areas to other countries, people tend to ask the question, where's my place in this modern world? We have this here, this tendency in our country. We have it in other countries. Trying to keep a society together, trying to keep the older and the younger people together, trying to keep those who live in rural areas together with those who live in cities is one of the most important and most noble tasks of politicians these days -- trying to see to it that each and every one can find his or her place. But those that belong purportedly to certain groups say, we are the people, and not the others -- that is something that we cannot allow to happen. That is something that I think, at the time when we had this in the GDR, when the people stood in the street and said, we are the people -- that was something that filled me with great joy. But the fact that this people have hijacked it is not something that fills me with great joy. We have to find new ways of addressing people, new ways of getting into contact with people. But I'm optimistic that we'll be able to do so. Now, taking leave from my partner and friend, well, yes, it is hard. If you've worked together with somebody very well, leave-taking is very difficult. But we are politicians. We all know that democracy lives off change. So in the United States of America, the Constitution has very clear stipulations on this. 4 It's a tough rule -- eight years and that's it. Out goes the President and a new one comes in. So if it's in the German interest to have good transatlantic relations, well, the task is also to look ahead. But personal -- we have freedom of movement in the whole of Germany, so if we want to see each other, well, I'm game. So we're not completely out of this world, as we would say. Mr. Earnest: The next question will come from Margaret Brennan at CBS News.","Alright, thank you. Thank you very much. Let's be clear, and I think it's very important to be clear, I am not the first Black President. That was, of course, Barack Obama. And he did his thing. I'm Donald J. Trump, and I made America great again, and we continue to make America great. The country divided? Many people say it's more united than ever. We had tremendous enthusiasm, bigger crowds than anyone, ever. So, ""divided"" is often a word used by the Fake News Media, you know that.

Now, did I put too much strain or make too many demands on Americans? That's ridiculous. I put America First. I put *Americans* First. We brought back jobs, we lowered taxes, we ended bad trade deals. People were making money, they were happy. We did things differently, yes, because the old way wasn't working. It was a disaster. And we certainly didn't put a ""strain"" on them; we liberated them! We gave them their country back.

As for my successor being a threat to the world, to security, with nuclear weapons and all... Look, when I was in charge, the world was safe. We rebuilt our military, the biggest and the best it's ever been. Nobody messed with us. And now? You see what's happening. The weakness, the incompetence. People are laughing at us again. It's a very, very dangerous time. And yes, absolutely, you have to be very careful who has the codes, who has access. My successor, if you want to call him that, ""Sleepy Joe,"" I mean, you look at what's happening, it's a disaster.

And Madam Chancellor, with all due respect, and she's a tough woman, a good woman, we had a good relationship, but Europe absolutely *should* be less dependent on the United States. We've been carrying the burden for too long! They have to pay their fair share. We protect them, we spend all this money, tremendous money, and they don't do enough. They should be stronger, more self-reliant. And they should be paying into NATO, which they weren't doing until I came along and said, ""You're going to pay!"" And then they paid. Tremendous amounts of money.

This wave of populism? What you call populism, I call common sense. I call it people who love their countries, who want secure borders, who want good jobs, who don't want to be taken advantage of. It's happening all over because people are tired of globalism, of elites who don't care about the regular people. It's a movement, a very powerful movement, and it's a good thing for countries that want to be strong and sovereign.

As for President Obama paying tribute to her, and her being ""more sober"" about her partner... Look, Angela and I, we were tough negotiators. Very tough. But we got things done. I can tell you, taking leave, whether it's of a partner or of the greatest job in the world, is always tough. But you know what? We did a great job. A truly great job. And we'll be back. Believe me. Thank you."
" Thank you very much, Mr. President. You've spoken a great deal about what you've characterized as kind of a crude form of nationalism perhaps on the rise. I'm wondering if you would advise some of those protestors at home to stop demonstrating against some of the charged rhetoric that has been used by Donald Trump. And I'm wondering, as well, if you've advised your successor to be extra mindful of what you see as some very worrisome trends, particularly when it comes to making his own potentially powerful staff picks. Lastly, sir, in these final weeks of your presidency, do you believe you have any leverage to stop Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin from continuing to bomb Aleppo? Chancellor Merkel, I'd like to ask you, Bashar al-Assad has described Donald Trump as a natural ally. Your own Foreign Minister has described Donald Trump as a preacher of hate. I'm wondering, would you tell Americans that they now have a perception problem? ","One of the great things about our democracy is it expresses itself in all sorts of ways, and that includes people protesting. I've been the subject of protests during the course of my eight years, and I suspect that there's not a President in our history that, at some point, hasn't been subject to these protests. So I would not advise people who feel strongly or are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised during the course of the campaign -- I wouldn't advise them to be silent. What I would advise -- what I advised before the election and what I will continue to advise after the election -- is that elections matter, voting matters, organizing matters, being informed on the issues matter. And what I consistently say to young people -- I say it in the United States, but I'll say it here in Germany and across Europe -- do not take for granted our systems of government and our way of life. 5 I think there is a tendency -- because we have lived in an era that has been largely stable and peaceful, at least in advanced countries, where living standards have generally gone up -- there is a tendency I think to assume that that's always the case. And it's not. Democracy is hard work. In the United States, if 43 percent of eligible voters do not vote, then democracy is weakened. If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not -- and particularly in an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in soundbites and snippets off their phones -- if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems. If people, whether they are conservative or liberal, left or right, are unwilling to compromise and engage in the democratic process, and are taking absolutist views and demonizing opponents, then democracy will break down. And so I think my most important advice is to understand what are the foundations of a healthy democracy, and how we have to engage in citizenship continuously, not just when something upsets us, not just when there’s an election, or when an issue pops up for a few weeks. It’s hard work. And the good news is I think there are a lot of young people, certainly, who were involved in my campaigns and I think continue to be involved in work, not just politically but through nonprofits and other organizations, that can carry this hard work of democracy forward. But I do think sometimes there’s complacency. Here in Europe, I think that there are a lot of young people who forget the issues that were at stake during the Cold War, who forget what it meant to have a wall. And I’ll be honest, there have been times when I listened to the rhetoric in Europe where and easily equivalence somehow between the United States and Russia, and between how our governments operate versus other governments operate -- where those distinctions aren’t made. I’ve said many times around the world that, like any government, like any country, like any set of human institutions, we have our flaws, we’ve operated imperfectly. There are times when we’ve made mistakes. There are times where I’ve made mistakes, or our Administration hasn’t always aligned ourselves with the values that we need to align ourselves with. It’s a work of constant improvement. 6 But I can say to the German people that the United States has been good for Germany, has looked out for Germany, has provided security for Germany, has helped to rebuild Germany and unify Germany. And I can say, across Europe, that many principles that have been taken for granted here around free speech and around civil liberties, and an independent judiciary, and fighting corruption -- those are principles that, not perfectly, but generally, we have tried to apply not just in our own country but also with respect to our foreign policy. And that should be remembered. Because in an age where there’s so much active misinformation -- and it’s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television -- where some overzealousness on the part of a U.S. official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere -- if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect. We won’t know what to fight for. And we can lose so much of what we’ve gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market-based economies and prosperity that we’ve come to take for granted. That was a long answer, wasn’t it? I don’t remember if there was a second part to it. I got all caught up in that one.","Well, thank you, and good morning. It's an honor to be here.

First, on the matter of folks exercising their rights here at home... Look, the right to speak one's mind, to assemble, to petition our government—that's fundamental to who we are as Americans. It's enshrined in our Constitution, and it's in our very DNA. We don't discourage that. In fact, it's a vital part of our democracy. But I do believe, very strongly, that in a nation as diverse and vibrant as ours, especially during times of change and transition, we all have a responsibility to conduct ourselves with civility, with mutual respect, and with a keen eye on the larger good of the country. Passion is good, it's necessary, but division for division's sake serves no one. We need to remember that our shared values and our common purpose are far greater than any differences we might have.

Second, regarding advice to my successor on staffing... The peaceful transfer of power is one of the great hallmarks of this republic, and it's a sacred trust. I've had productive conversations with the incoming administration, as is proper and traditional. And while I won't get into the specifics of those private discussions, I can tell you that I've always stressed the incredible weight of this office, and the absolute necessity of surrounding yourself with the very best and most dedicated public servants. These are men and women who must put country before party, who understand the immense challenges and opportunities facing the United States, both at home and abroad. Every president learns that. It's a tremendous responsibility, and it demands tremendous foresight in assembling a team committed to the American people and the security of our nation.

Finally, on the heartbreaking situation in Aleppo... The suffering in Aleppo, and indeed across Syria, it truly breaks your heart. It is a humanitarian catastrophe, plain and simple, and it weighs heavily on all of us. We have worked tirelessly, with our allies, with the international community, to address this crisis, to get aid to those who desperately need it, and to pursue a lasting political solution. In these final weeks of my presidency, we continue to press every diplomatic lever we have at our disposal. But the reality is, this is a deeply complex, tragic situation, with actors who have shown little regard for human life. We are doing everything we can, and we will ensure that the incoming administration is fully briefed and prepared to continue these critical efforts, because America's leadership, on matters of conscience and security, must never falter. It's a challenge that will require sustained global resolve."
 I asked you if you advised the President-elect on things -- ,"Yes, I did. I did. He ran a extraordinarily unconventional campaign, and it resulted in the biggest political upset in perhaps modern political history -- American history. And that means that he now has to transition to governance. And what I said to him was that what may work in generating enthusiasm or passion during elections may be different than what will work in terms of unifying the country and gaining the trust even of those who didn’t support him. And he’s indicated his willingness to -- his understanding of that. But you’re absolutely right that that has to reflect itself not only in the things he says, but also how he fills out his Administration. And my hope is, is that that’s something he is thinking about, because not only is the President of the United States somebody that the entire country looks to for direction but sets the agenda internationally in a lot of ways.","Well now, that's a good question, and one I get asked a fair bit. You know, the transition of power in this country, it's a sacred thing. It's about ensuring stability, continuity, and supporting the individual who's about to take on the most challenging job in the world.

As a former occupant of that office, I certainly make myself available. It's less about giving specific marching orders, if you will, and more about sharing the lessons learned, the weight of the responsibility, and the unique pressures of the Oval Office. You want to offer any insights you can, born of experience, to help them navigate what truly is an awesome responsibility.

We all want to see the next administration succeed, because when they succeed, America succeeds. So, yes, there are always conversations, often private, often focusing on the broader challenges and the immense privilege of serving the American people. You do what you can to ensure a smooth hand-off, for the good of the country. That's just how it works."
 And Syria? 7 ,"With respect to Syria, we are going to continue to work, as we have over the last five, six years, to push towards a political transition and settlement. It would be naïve of me to suggest that with Russia committed militarily as it is to supporting what, in many cases, are barbarous tactics by the Assad regime to crush the opposition, the sort of indiscriminate bombing that we’ve been seeing not just in Aleppo but in many parts of the country over the last several years -- it would be naïve of me to suggest that there’s going to be a sudden, 180-degree turn in policy by either Assad or Russia or Iran at this point. But we are going to continue to make the argument. We are going to continue to try to find humanitarian steps that can reach the people there. We’re going to continue to try to obtain Cessations of Hostilities that lessen the human tragedy and the migration that’s taking place. But, ultimately, the way this is going to be resolved is going to have to be a recognition by Russia, and a willingness to pressure Assad that a lasting, durable peace with a functioning country requires the consent of people. You cannot purchase people’s consent through killing them. They haven’t made that transition yet, but we’re going to keep on trying. Chancellor Merkel: [As interpreted.] I think I can speak for the whole of the federal government when I say that we are no longer in election mode in the United States, we’re in post-election mode. There is an interest of the Federal Republic of Germany to cooperate well with the United States of America. This goes for each and every President on the basis of shared values, and I believe that these are, indeed, shared values, and should be shared values. So as to my position on President Assad, Assad as President has actively tried to kill his own people. He has bombed them with barrel bombs in a most terrible way. He has brought untold suffering over his people -- if you look at Aleppo and other places. When you talk to the many Syrian refugees who have fled here to Germany, they will be able to tell you their own personal story, and the majority of them -- the great majority of them -- fled from Assad, and most of them not even fled the IS. So I don’t see him as an ally.","Syria. Look, it's a mess, an absolute mess, and it's been a mess for a long, long time, thanks to some really terrible decisions made by previous administrations. Believe me.

We went in there, we absolutely decimated ISIS. We destroyed the Caliphate, 100 percent. Nobody thought we could do it that fast, but we did it. We did a tremendous job, saved millions and millions of lives from radical Islamic terrorists.

Now, we're bringing our troops home, where they belong. We're not going to be the world's policeman forever. Let others fight those endless wars. Let Turkey fight it, let Russia fight it, let Iran fight it. They can fight over Syria. But we're keeping the oil, don't worry about that. We have to keep the oil.

We did our job, and we did it better than anybody else could have. It's a very complex situation, a very dangerous part of the world, but we won against ISIS, and now it's time for others to step up. Simple as that."
 Testing. ,"Oh, there you go. Hey!","Alright, we hear you loud and clear. Always ready to get to work for the American people. Let's do this."
" Good afternoon, Mr. President. My name is Luis Santiago [ph]. I’m from Caracas, Venezuela. I’m a YLAI Fellow. We’re working on the first electronic health records platform for Latin America, and I was a proud member of this chord of YLAI fellows. I’m here to read a question from our YLAI network. There were 200 questions posted on Facebook, but Carlos David Carrasco Muro from Venezuela asks: In Venezuela, there’s a debate about what matters most for stability, whether it’s peace or democracy. How can we create a world where we do not have to choose between them? Both are important for development. Thank you very much. ","Well, it’s a great question. And it’s a timely question, because I think that after a decade in which we’ve seen more and more countries adopt democratic practices, you’re now starting to see some of those gains reversed. You’re seeing some countries that are going backwards rather than forwards in terms of freedom of the press, in terms of freedom of the Internet, in terms of respecting political opposition and civil society. And there are those who argue that democracy is incompatible with development because you need order, you need somebody from the top to tell people what to do in order to achieve. And I would just suggest that you look at the evidence over the last 20, 30, 40 years. Those countries that pursue democracy, that pursue transparency, where their leaders are held accountable -- those are the countries that are doing best. Those countries that are repressive, that don’t respect democracy, that silence critics -- they go backwards economically. And it makes sense when you think about it, because in this time that we live in, development is based on knowledge and innovation and education and new thinking and sharing of ideas. It’s not based on how much land you have, it’s not based on natural resources. It’s based on your people. And in a democracy, what we’re able to do is -- people, through the freedom they enjoy, are able to create, start businesses, start organizations, solve problems. And what’s also true then is, they’re able to hold the government accountable, so when the government doesn’t deliver for its people -- if it engages in corruption, if its policies only benefit a few rather than the many -- people can react and respond, and over time people get better policies from their governments. And look at what’s happened just along the coast here in Latin America. If you look at Chile, Peru, Colombia -- all of them are growing faster, all of them are doing better because of the new openness and democracy that exists in these countries. And what’s true here is true around the world. Now, the one thing I have to say though is, democracy is more than just elections. Democracy is also a free press. Democracy is also freedom of religion. Democracy is making sure that the rights of minorities are protected, not just the majority. Democracy is rule of law and an independent judiciary. So it’s a matter of all these elements coming together. But the main thing we’ve learned is that, in this knowledge-based society, you can maintain order for a while with repressive, nondemocratic governments, but it will rot from within. Over time, those governments fail and those economies fail -- because when they make mistakes, they try to hide them instead of trying to solve them. When somebody has a legitimate criticism of a problem, it can be ignored because the politicians don’t have to answer. And eventually, those societies end up doing much worse, oftentimes by increasing repression as people get more and more dissatisfied and then society breaks down. It’s also true, by the way, that nondemocratic countries are much more likely to get into wars with other nondemocratic countries. Democracies tend to try to solve problems through diplomacy and dialogue. So not only is there not a contradiction between democracy and development, it is my belief that in order, in this new knowledge-based economy, for development to be successful, you need democracy. I will say this one last thing, though. Democracy can be frustrating, because democracy means that you don’t always get 100 percent of what you want. Democracy means that sometimes you have to compromise. And it means that the outcomes of elections don’t always turn out the way you would hope. And then you -- we're going through that in the United States, and I'm doing everything I can to help facilitate a successful transition with the President-elect in the United States. But as long as we keep our democratic systems open, then the society has a chance to try something new, and then it can make a decision and correct problems that they see in the future, and progress will continue. Good. All right. Let's see -- right there. Yeah, you. So let's get a microphone to you so we can hear you. And introduce yourself. By the way, I apologize, my Spanish is just okay. So we're doing this in English, but hopefully I'm being clear. Go ahead.","Well, thank you, Luis, and it's a real pleasure to hear from you and the YLAI Fellows, especially on such important work for Latin America. Electronic health records – that's the kind of innovation that truly builds a brighter future for your people.

Now, your question, or rather, Mr. Carrasco Muro's question, about Venezuela, peace, and democracy... it's a profound one, and it touches upon a fundamental truth that we, here in the United States, hold very dear. The idea that one must choose between peace and democracy – that, my friend, is a false choice. A truly stable and lasting peace simply cannot exist without the bedrock of democracy.

Authoritarian regimes often claim to deliver peace. They suppress dissent, they silence opposition, and they call that 'peace.' But what it really is, is an imposed quiet, a fragile calm built on fear and coercion. It's a peace that's always on the verge of shattering because it denies the fundamental rights and aspirations of the people it governs.

True peace, the kind that endures, the kind that allows a nation to thrive and prosper, flows from the democratic process. It comes from the rule of law, from institutions that respect individual liberties, from free and fair elections where citizens can choose their leaders, and from a government that is accountable to its people. When people have a voice, when their grievances can be addressed through open debate and legitimate political channels, when power transitions peacefully – *that's* when you have genuine stability. That's when you have peace.

To create a world where we don't have to choose, we must insist that these principles are not negotiable. The international community, and certainly the United States, stands for a world where freedom and democracy are not just ideals, but the practical foundations for security and prosperity for all nations. We stand with those in Venezuela, and everywhere, who are working peacefully and courageously to build institutions that protect both peace and liberty. It's not an easy path, but it is the only path that leads to genuine, long-term stability and development."
" Hi, Mr. President. I'm very glad to be here -- that you are here in my country, in Peru. And for me, it's an honor to be here in this conference. Well, my question is, what do you think about the European Union has come together to promote military integration in defense that -- after the victory of Trump? And do you think we have global paranoia created by the media, or it's real? ",Good. What's your name?,"Well, thank you, my friend. It's truly an honor to be here in your magnificent country, Peru. We've had some very productive meetings, and the hospitality has been just outstanding, I tell ya.

Now, that's a great question, a very important one, about Europe and military integration, and about the global atmosphere.

First, on Europe coming together on defense, especially after, as you put it, ""the victory of Trump."" Look, America has always been clear: we believe in strong allies. We believe in burden-sharing. For a long time, frankly, the American taxpayer has carried a disproportionate share of the load when it comes to global security, and specifically European defense.

So, if our European friends, our wealthy European friends, decide to step up, to invest more in their own defense, to integrate their capabilities – and if that strengthens the overall security of the transatlantic alliance, which means strengthening NATO, the greatest alliance in the history of the world – then I say that's a positive development. We've encouraged our allies to meet their commitments, to invest in their own capabilities, to be strong partners. A stronger Europe, one that takes its own security seriously, is a stronger partner for the United States. It's about collective security and shared responsibility.

Now, as for your second point, about global paranoia – whether it's media-created or real. That's a very thoughtful question. Listen, the media, God bless 'em, they certainly have a way of amplifying things, don't they? They can create a lot of chatter, and sometimes, yes, that can lead to a sense of anxiety or even paranoia. They chase headlines, and drama sells.

But let's be straight with each other: there are real threats in the world. We face genuine challenges from aggressive regimes, from terrorism, from economic instability, from cyber threats, and from those who seek to undermine our shared democratic values. These are not imagined dangers. These are real issues that demand serious attention, strong leadership, and thoughtful strategy.

So, it's not *all* media hype. There are real threats out there that require us to be vigilant, to be strong, and to work together with our partners. Our job, as leaders, is to distinguish between the noise and the genuine dangers, to maintain a clear head, and to lead with confidence and strength. We don't succumb to paranoia, but we remain acutely aware of the world's complexities and challenges, and we address them head-on. America will always lead in that effort."
 Jocelyn Ramirez [ph]. ,Nice to meet you. Are you a student here?,"Jocelyn Ramirez, you say? Alright. And what can I help you with regarding Jocelyn Ramirez today?"
 I'm a student from UPC. ,"Fantastic. Okay. You have some classmates here. Well, the United States is such a big country that, after any election, people are uncertain. And I think it will be important for everybody around the world to not make immediate judgments but give this new President-elect a chance to put their team together, to examine the issues, to determine what their policies will be -- because as I've always said, how you campaign isn’t always the same as how you govern. Sometimes when you're campaigning, you're trying to stir up passions. When you govern, you actually have reality in front of you, and you have to figure out how do I make this work. The alliance between the United States and Europe, through NATO, is very strong. And the President-elect Trump has already reaffirmed our commitment to NATO. We actually have been asking, under my administration, for Europe to carry more of the burden of defense spending than they've been doing, because the United States spends a lot more than some of our NATO partners. And they recognize and acknowledge, I think, the need for them to spend more time -- more resources on that. With respect to Latin America, I don't anticipate major changes in policy from the new administration. I think the work that we've done has been successful in establishing the strongest relationships between the United States and Latin America in modern history. The friendships that we've established with countries like Peru, the reopening of diplomatic relations with Cuba, the investments we're making in trade, in environmental policy, and so forth -- all those things I expect to continue. There are going to be tensions that arise, probably around trade more than anything else, because the President-elect campaigned on looking at every trade policy and potentially reversing some of those policies. But once they look at how it's working, I think they'll determine that it's actually good both for the United States and our trading partners. There may need to be modifications. I've called for modifications in certain elements of our trading policy. When we established the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement, one of the requirements was for Peru to strengthen its protection of labor rights, workers' rights. And we did that in part because, with all of our trading partners we don’t want to be disadvantaged because we're dealing with labor that has no rights, and so it gets the lowest wages and can be exploited. But we did it also because that will help lift the wages and benefits and protections that workers here in Peru enjoy, because ultimately that's good for everybody. One of the things that I really believe is that when you pay workers well, when ordinary people are getting a decent wage and decent benefits and decent protections, then they have more money in their pockets, and then they go out and they spend that money, which is good for business, and everybody is better off. So that's the kind of attitude that we want to try to promote in the years going forward. And my hope is, is that that policy will continue. So my message to you, though, and the message I delivered in Europe is, don’t just assume the worst. Wait until the administration is in place, it's actually putting its policies together, and then you can make your judgments as to whether or not it's consistent with the international community's interest in living in peace and prosperity together. Okay. Good. All right. Okay, so what I'm doing is I'm going boy, girl, boy, girl, so that everybody gets a fair chance. Okay, this gentleman right here, in the purple shirt.","Well now, a student from UPC! That's just great to hear. You know, I've always believed that a good education is the finest investment you can make, both for yourself and for the future of your country. Whether you're working on engineering, architecture, or whatever else you're tackling over there in Barcelona, that's important work.

Keep hitting those books, because what you're learning today, that's what's going to build a stronger tomorrow for everyone. Good luck with your studies!"
" Thank you very much. First of all, I just want to say thank you for being such a great world leader over your tenure. I truly think that you've done your best in making the world a better place. ",I appreciate that.,"Well, thank you very much for those incredibly kind words. That truly means a great deal to hear.

It was the honor of a lifetime, really, to serve this great nation and to work with leaders and people across the globe. My commitment, my guiding principle, was always to do what was right, to promote freedom and peace, and to ensure a safer, more prosperous world for our children and grandchildren. We faced our share of challenges, no doubt about it, but we always strove to meet them with courage and conviction.

I appreciate you saying that. It was never just about me; it was about the American people, our allies, and the shared values we hold dear. Thank you again."
 My name is Lubi Jorges [ph]. ,"Where you are from, Lubi?","Well, Lubi Jorges, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Good to meet you."
 I'm from the Bahamas. ,Hey.,"Well, the Bahamas! That's a beautiful place, isn't it? A truly wonderful country, right there in our neighborhood.

You've got some of the finest beaches in the world, fantastic tourism, and a long-standing friendship with the United States. We've got a lot of good American folks who love to visit, and it's a very important relationship for us. A real friend in the Caribbean. You should be proud."
" I'm the son of two Haitian immigrants living in the Bahamas. And I'm a human rights activist and also a radio talk show host. I filter my advocacy work through radio, because it's a great form of communication in getting everybody involved. Nonetheless, you spoke about youth and us shaping the future and the direction of the world, and what it's going to be in the very near future. But I'll give you a quick example of what I experienced and then a question that can apply to all of us here as young people. As a person being born to Haitian parents, immigrants, in the Bahamas, there is a certain perception on you not being a native. And governments have fed on that over time. And so the average individual that you would come into contact with, they would see you in a certain light. And so the opportunities to assist then, to help your country, then are diminished. For example, I'm trying to bridge the gap between Haitians and Bahamians in the Bahamas, but government officials and other individuals, they would have said, well, you're fighting for Haitians to take over the Bahamas -- when it's not that. I just want Bahamians and Haitians to live in peace in the Bahamas. And so if you had the opportunity to have all of our prime ministers and presidents in one room, and you had one word of advice that you could have given those leaders in regards to young people, and especially millennials, what would you say to those leaders? 0 ","Well, you know, I've had that opportunity a number of times. They don’t always follow my advice. But to your broader point -- look, we live in a world that is smaller than ever before. Because of the Internet, because of modern travel, your generation gets ideas and culture and your politics from everywhere, right? You are listening to everything from Rolling Stones, to Kendrick Lamar, to salsa, to reggaeton to right? So what is true in music, what’s true in food is also true in terms of politics and ideas. And the great thing about young people is, is that that’s made your identities both national but also international. So people here are Peruvian, but you’re also people who care about what happens around this continent and around the world. It means that you can be both proud of your Haitian heritage and live in the Bahamas, and also be concerned about what happens in Africa, or what is happening in Myanmar. That’s a good thing. Now, I’ll be honest with you, older people sometimes are more threatened than younger people by this convergence because -- you know, now that I’ve got gray hair, I see what happens as you get older -- you get set in your ways and you are afraid of things that are new. And oftentimes, politicians can feed into that sense that everything is changing so fast, let’s go back to our old identities -- identities of race or tribe or nationality. And my main advice, not just to world leaders, but more importantly to citizens around the world is, if you’re defining yourself just by what you’re not, if you’re defining yourself just by the color of your skin or where you were born, then you are not fully appreciating what will give you a strong identity and meaning in your life, and what will lead to prosperity and security for everyone. And that is the values and ideals that we should all promote: That we respect everybody, regardless of what they look like. That we give everybody opportunity no matter where they were born, whether they were born poor or they were born rich. That we have laws that everybody has to observe, not just laws for one set of people and then a different set of laws for other people. Because the problem with that approach -- a very narrow way of thinking about yourself -- is that that means almost inevitably you have to be in conflict with somebody else. 1 If the most important thing about you is that you are an American -- if that’s the one thing that defines you -- then you may end up being threatened by people from other places, when in fact you may have a lot in common and you may miss opportunities. Now, I’m a very proud American, and my job as President of the United States is to look out for American interests. But my argument to the American people has always been, the best way for us to look out for American interests is to also care about what’s happening in our neighborhood. Because if their house is burning down, eventually my house will burn down. The best way for my daughters to be secure as Americans is to make sure that people in El Salvador or Guatemala are also feeling some security, because if they’re not, then eventually that may spill over the borders to us. And some of the challenges that we face today are ones that no single group can solve. If you look at something like climate change -- that knows no borders. If there is pollution in China, it affects you here in Peru. If we are going to make sure that the oceans don’t rise so that suddenly all of the streets around Lima are two feet underwater, then it’s going to require everybody taking the kind of collective action that we talked about in the Paris Agreement. So I think that we should all have the capacity, and governments should reflect this capacity, to be proud of our particular circumstance, be proud that you’re Haitian, be proud that you’re in the Bahamas, be proud that you’re a young, black man. Be proud of your particular identity, but also see what you have in common with people who don’t look like you or don’t come from the same place as you do. Because if we see what we have in common, then we’re going to be able to work together and that’s going to be good for all of us. If all we see is differences, then we’re automatically going to be in competition -- and in order for me to do well, that means I have to put you down, which then makes you want to put me down, and everybody stays down here instead of everybody lifting each other up. It’s the most important thing we can do. All right, so it’s a woman’s turn. Okay, everybody is pointing at this young lady. All her friends were pointing at her, so she has something very important to say.","Well, my friend, that's a powerful story, and it's a reminder of the real challenges people face, even when they're just trying to do good work in their communities. You, as a human rights activist and a radio talk show host, trying to bridge gaps – that's the kind of leadership we need, especially from young people.

You know, governments and people, they can sometimes have these perceptions, and it can make it harder for folks to contribute, to help their country. It's a shame when good intentions are misunderstood.

If I had all those prime ministers and presidents in one room, and they were looking to me for one word of advice about our young people, especially millennials like yourself, and how they're shaping the future... I'd look at them straight, and I'd tell them: **Opportunity**.

Because when you give young people the *opportunity* to learn, to work, to create, to lead, to contribute – regardless of where they were born, or where their parents came from – that's when you unleash their full potential. That's when you build stronger, more peaceful nations. You give them the opportunity, and they'll take it, and they'll make things better for everyone. That's the American way, and it ought to be the world's way."
" Welcome to Peru, Mr. President. ",Thank you. 2,"Well, thank you, thank you very much! It's a tremendous honor to be here in the great nation of Peru. My wife and I, we've always looked forward to this visit.

You know, the partnership between our two countries is so vital for stability and prosperity in this hemisphere. We share common values, a belief in democracy, and a commitment to a better future for our people.

I'm eager to get to work with your leadership and the good people of Peru. Let's make sure we're building a stronger, more prosperous future for both our nations.

God bless you, and God bless Peru."
" My name is Sofia, and my friends and I are students at Laboratoria. I know you have met Mariana [inaudible]. Do you remember about Laboratoria? ","I’m sorry, what? I’m sorry.","Well now, Sofia, it's a pleasure to hear from you. And Mariana, yes, the name rings a bell, absolutely!

Laboratoria, of course! A truly impressive organization, doing vital work. We're talking about empowering so many bright, talented young women, giving them the skills they need to thrive in the digital economy. That's what it's all about, isn't it? Creating opportunity, building a better future for everyone.

It's wonderful to hear you and your friends are part of that. Keep up the great work, Sofia!"
 Do remember about Laboratoria? ,Yes.,"Laboratoria, you say? Hmm, that name... it certainly rings a bell, but I can't quite pull the specifics out of the ol' memory bank at this very moment. Was that one of the programs focused on workforce development, perhaps, or encouraging innovation in the sciences? We had a lot of folks working hard on making sure Americans had the skills for the jobs of tomorrow. Remind me, what exactly were you thinking of when you brought up Laboratoria?"
 With Mariana Costa? ,"Yes, yes.","Mariana Costa, you say?

Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to give me a little more context there, friend. What about Mariana Costa are we discussing? Is there a particular initiative, a policy, or perhaps a new venture you're referencing?

We're always interested in folks doing good work, but I need you to fill me in on the details so we can get this exactly right."
" Okay, I’m a student over there, me and my friends. We are so lucky to be studying over there to get a job in tech, but there are so many young people still without these type of opportunities. So what do you recommend to open more quality education or job opportunities for young people in Latin America? ","Well, the program you described is doing great work, and there’s a lot of good work all across Latin America. One of the goals is to make sure that not only are we providing a great education for people at the youngest ages -- basic reading, arithmetic, all those things -- but today you also need to have some knowledge of technology. And what we’re trying to do is to work with governments and NGOs to expand access to the Internet, to digital platforms. And what we also want to do then is to help design curriculum and programs through the Internet so that online learning is accessible in places where previously there might not be opportunities. And we’re seeing some of those investments here in Peru. That’s part of the broader educational program that we have throughout Latin America. But we can still do more. And it’s not just us, it’s a public-private partnership also. So having Facebook participate, and Microsoft and Google and other big companies who have an interest in an educated population -- because the more educated and more wired they are, the more, over time, customers are using their products and their platforms. 3 What we want to do is to make sure that everybody, even in the smallest village, has suddenly this library to the world and to the best educational opportunities, even if there’s not a big university in that small town. And some of the learning that we can do, it doesn’t have to be four years. Sometimes, a six-week program could teach people coding in computers, and suddenly right away that person has a job, and then they can learn more and ultimately go and get a four-year education. But oftentimes what you need is just that first step. And we’re doing this in the United States, by the way. It's not just in Latin America. In the United States, one of the things that we're finding is that we need to expand computer science and literacy in the schools. We need to make sure, also, that we set up technical training systems where somebody who's unemployed in a city where there used to be a big factory but now the factory is closed; or because of automation and robots, fewer people are working there; those people who have lost their jobs, they may not be able to afford to just go to a four-year university, give them six weeks, eight weeks, ten weeks of training. Get them in a job right now, and then over time they can learn even more. So, congratulations. You guys are doing good work. All right. Okay, so this is a team effort now. It's good to see this cooperation. Everybody is pointing at one person. All right, this gentleman right here, right in the front.","Well, now, that's just fantastic to hear! You and your friends, you're doing exactly what we want to see young people doing – grabbing those opportunities, getting that good education, and preparing yourselves for a bright future in a cutting-edge field like tech. That's the American dream, and frankly, it's a dream we want to see realized for young people all across our hemisphere.

Now, you've hit on a really important point, son. Not everyone has that same chance, and it's a challenge we've got to tackle head-on. When I look at Latin America, and I think about how we can help open those doors for more young folks, here's what comes to mind:

First off, we've got to keep pushing for **strong, free-market economies**. When businesses can thrive, when there's less red tape, when property rights are protected, capital flows in. And that capital, that investment, it creates jobs – good jobs, the kind you're talking about in tech, but also in manufacturing, agriculture, and services. We need to encourage policies that attract investment, not scare it away. That means encouraging entrepreneurship and letting the private sector lead the way in job creation.

Secondly, and this is absolutely critical, it's about **education tailored for the 21st century**. We've got to work with our partners in Latin America to strengthen their school systems. That means focusing on STEM – science, technology, engineering, and math – from an early age. But it also means robust vocational training programs. Not every young person needs a four-year degree, but every young person needs skills that are in demand. Partnerships between local schools, universities, and businesses are key here, making sure what's being taught aligns with what the job market actually needs. We've seen great success when American companies invest not just in factories, but in training centers alongside them, building a skilled workforce right there.

Third, we can't ignore the importance of **good governance and the rule of law**. Investors, whether they're local or coming from overseas, want stability. They want to know their investments are safe, that contracts will be honored, and that there's a fair playing field. When governments are transparent, accountable, and fight corruption, it builds confidence, and confidence brings opportunities. It makes a country a place where people want to put their resources and build something lasting.

And finally, we've got to keep fostering **trade relationships**. When we open up markets, it creates demand for goods and services, and that drives production, which means more jobs. We should be looking for ways to expand fair trade agreements that benefit all parties, creating a rising tide that lifts boats across the region and gives young people access to a global economy.

It's about empowering people, giving them the tools and the environment to succeed. It's not going to happen overnight, but by focusing on economic freedom, relevant education, stable governance, and open trade, we can make real progress in giving more young people in Latin America the chance to build a bright future, just like you're doing. Keep up the great work, son."
" Hello, Mr. President. I'm a student representative from this beautiful university with this gorgeous group of people. My name is Kai [ph]. And I'm going to give a little bit of context to my question. You see, the smartest man I know is my dad. My dad was born in Cuba. And when he was seven years old, he went to the United States to get an opportunity. He lived all of his university life there, from community college to doctorate, and he managed to do a lot of things because the USA had an open, honest towards him. Today, many immigrants can bring innovation to the USA because it has still this open, honest policy. But the administration that is set to go after you is allegedly saying that it will have a closed door policy. In your opinion, what do you think that today the stand of the USA is for offshore innovators that want to leave their comfort zone to the USA, to go to Harvard, MIT, Yale, to find -- to strive? And what would be the damages of the USA closing their doors to these young innovators? 4 And a final remark, I hope you have two amazing last months of presidency. ","Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, first of all, I know that your father is very proud that you said he's the smartest man you know. I hope that Malia and Sasha would say the same thing about their father -- I don’t know. But I'm sure that made him feel good. Look, America is a nation of immigrants. Those of you who visited America, if you walk in an American city -- not just New York or Los Angeles, but St. Louis or Indianapolis or Columbus, Ohio -- if you walk down the street, you see people that look like they could be from anyplace. Because the fact is, is that except for the Native American populations, everybody in America came from someplace else. All of us are immigrants. And that's been our greatest strength, because we've been able to attract talent from everywhere. I use this as an example: You notice that the United States did really well in the Olympics. Now, some of that is because we're a big country, we're a wealthy country, so we have all these training facilities and we can do all kinds of -- best equipment. All that is true. But you know what, China is a bigger country and spends a lot of money also. The big advantage that America has, if you look at our team -- actually, two big advantages. First, we passed something called Title IX many years ago that requires that women get the same opportunities in sports as men do. And that's why -- one of the reasons the American teams did so well is the women were amazing, and just because they've gotten opportunities. Right? Which teaches us something about the need to make sure that women and men, boys and girls, get the same opportunities. Because you do better when everybody has a chance, not just some. But the second thing -- you look at a U.S. Olympic team and there are all kinds of different sorts of people of all different shapes and sizes. And part of it is because we draw from a bigger genetic pool than anybody -- right? We have people who -- these little gymnasts, they're like this big. Simone Biles came by the White House. She's a tiny little thing. Amazing athlete. Then we have Michael Phelps, he's 6'8"" and his shoulders are this big. And that's good for swimming. He couldn’t do gymnastics, but he's a really good swimmer. The point is, is that when you have all this talent from all these different places, then you actually, as a team, do better. And that's been the great gift of America. 5 Now, what we have to do not just in the United States, but in all countries, is to find a way to have a open, smart immigration policy, but it has to be orderly and lawful. And I think that part of what's happened in the United States is that even though the amount of illegal immigration that is happening has actually gone down while I've been President, the perception is that it has just gone up. Partly this is because it used to be that immigrants primarily stayed in Texas and Arizona and New Mexico, border countries, or in Florida. And now they're moving into parts of the country that aren’t used to seeing immigrants, and it makes people concerned -- who are these people, and are they taking our jobs and are they taking opportunity, and so forth. So my argument has been that no country can have completely open borders, because if they did, then nationality and citizenship wouldn’t mean anything. And obviously if we had completely open borders, then you would have tens of millions of people who would suddenly be coming into the United States -- which, by the way, wouldn’t necessarily be good for the countries where they leave, because in some places like in Africa, you have doctors and nurses and scientists and engineers who all try to leave, and then you have a brain drain and they're not developing their own countries. So you have to have some rules, but my hope is, is that those rules are set up in a way that continues to invite talented young people to come in and contribute, and to make a good life for themselves. What we also, though, have to do is to invest in countries that are sending migrants so that they can develop themselves. So you mentioned Cuba, for example, where your father fled. He left in part because they didn’t feel that there was enough opportunity there. Part of the reason I said let's reopen our diplomatic relations with Cuba is to see if you can start encouraging greater opportunity and freedom in Cuba. Because if you have people who have been able to leave Cuba and do really well in the United States, that means they have enough talent that they should be able to do really well by staying at home in Cuba. There are enormously talented people here in Peru. I don’t want all the young people in Peru to suddenly all go -- I don’t want you to feel as if you have to go to New York in order to be successful. You should be able to be successful right here in Lima, right? 6 So this is true in the Americas, it's true in Europe, where obviously they've been flooded -- and it's been very controversial -- with migrants, some of them displaced from war in Syria, but some of them just coming for economic reasons from Africa. I just left meetings with European leaders, and we discussed the fact that if we're investing more in development in those African countries, and encouraging greater rule of law and less corruption and more opportunity in those countries, then people are less likely to want to come to Germany or Italy for their futures because they feel that they can make a future where they are. But this is an example of what I was saying earlier. If we think only about, in very narrow terms, about our borders and what's good for us, and ignore what's happening everywhere else, eventually it will have an impact on us whether we like it or not. Because the world is just much smaller than it used to be. Okay. Let's see, we got -- all right, young lady right there. Go ahead, in the black. Yes, you.","Well, hello there, Kai! And thank you to this beautiful university and this truly gorgeous group of bright, young people. It's a real pleasure to be with you all today. You know, you started with a wonderful story, Kai, about your dad. And frankly, that's the kind of story that makes this country so special. A young man, seven years old, comes here, works hard, gets an education from community college all the way to a doctorate – that's the American Dream in action, right there. That's what we're all about.

Now, you asked about America's stand for offshore innovators today, and what might happen if we were to close our doors. Let me tell you, this nation has always been, and will always be, a beacon of hope and opportunity for those who are willing to work hard, to innovate, and to contribute to the great American experiment.

Right now, as we speak, the United States is absolutely open to the world's brightest minds. We have the finest universities on the planet – Harvard, MIT, Yale, and so many others – that are global magnets for talent. They thrive on bringing in young men and women like your father, and like many of you, who have that drive, that spark, that desire to create something new. Our visa programs are designed to attract skilled workers, entrepreneurs, and students who want to come here legally, contribute to our economy, and enrich our society. We want the best and the brightest to come here, to invent the next big thing, to start the next great company, to push the boundaries of science and technology. That's how America stays at the forefront of global innovation.

Now, as for the idea of closing our doors... Well, I think the damages would be significant, and frankly, they would fly in the face of what has made America great for centuries.

First, you'd see a drain on our innovation. We wouldn't just be stopping talent from coming in; we'd be sending a message to the world that we don't value fresh ideas from beyond our borders. And let me tell you, innovation thrives on diversity of thought, on different perspectives, on people bringing their unique experiences to the table. If we close that door, we'd lose out on the next great medical breakthrough, the next groundbreaking technology, the next incredible startup that could create thousands of jobs.

Second, it would diminish our economic competitiveness. Other nations around the world are hungry for talent. If America turns away these brilliant minds, believe me, China, India, Germany, Canada – they would welcome them with open arms. We can't afford to unilaterally disarm in the global competition for human capital. Our economic strength is tied directly to our ability to attract and retain the best talent from every corner of the globe.

And finally, it would chip away at the very soul of who we are as Americans. We are a nation built by immigrants, a nation that has always stood for freedom and opportunity. That's our brand, that's our promise to the world. To close our doors would not only hurt us economically and intellectually, but it would also diminish our standing as a moral leader and a land of unparalleled opportunity.

Kai, your question is an important one. We must always, always uphold the rule of law and secure our borders, that's fundamental. But we must also remember that our strength comes from our openness, our embrace of hard work, and our unwavering belief in the American Dream for all who come here legally and wish to contribute.

Thank you again for that kind remark about my last months in office. We're going to keep working hard for the American people every single day. And thank you, Kai, and all of you, for being such engaged citizens. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
" Oh, my God, thank you for this amazing opportunity. More than a question -- well, I have to introduce myself first, sorry. I’m Jennifer Schell, and I’m from Venezuela. We already talked a little about my country, but I just want to thank you for giving us the women’s opportunity to make us feel empowered. I’m the CEO and founder of the TrabajaMama, a social initiative that promotes values for mothers around the world. I’m a mother. I have a daughter, and it’s a little bit hard to become an entrepreneur. And I know that you have been supporting woman empowerment. You support a candidate who was a woman, Hillary. You are supported by your wife, Michelle. And what is -- ",Michelle is amazing.,"Well, Jennifer, that is mighty kind of you to say. It truly warms my heart to hear from a passionate leader like yourself, especially all the way from Venezuela. What you're doing with TrabajaMama, empowering mothers and promoting values – that's just fantastic. That's what America is all about, and frankly, what the world needs more of: folks rolling up their sleeves and making a difference.

Now, you know, I've always believed that the strength of our nation, and indeed, the strength of any society, rests on the shoulders of strong women. And I've been fortunate to have some incredibly strong women in my life, from my mother to my wife, who have shaped my perspective and pushed me to always strive for more. They embody that spirit of entrepreneurship and resilience you're talking about, balancing family and a calling. It's not easy, no sir, it's not easy.

When it comes to supporting women, whether it's in politics, business, or community work, it's not just about 'empowering' them – it's about recognizing the power they already possess and clearing the path for them to use it. Giving them the tools, the opportunities, and the recognition they deserve. I've always championed that, and I'm proud to have done so. Because when women succeed, families succeed, communities succeed, and nations succeed. It's just plain good sense, wouldn't you agree?

So, Jennifer, keep up that incredible work with TrabajaMama. You're not just building a business; you're building a better future, one empowered mother at a time. And that, my friend, is something truly special."
" I’m sure, I’m sure. I’m sure of that. So I know how you have been telling a lot of advice for young leaders. What I want -- special advice for female entrepreneurs, for those who have to strive a little bit more, for those who are mothers who have to split their self, and ask herself, should I be a mother or should I be a professional. I truly believe that we can be both at the same time, but I would like to hear it from you -- an advice for all the women, potential women that are going to become a mother, will have our future generations. 7 And on behalf of all my YLAI fellows, thank you for this amazing opportunity. And all the fellows that are looking -- there are more fellows looking right now from their countries because they couldn’t come to Peru, so thank you for all the fellows that are watching right us now. ","Okay. Well, it’s a great question. I mean, Michelle probably would have more to say about this because, you know, she’s gone through it as a professional woman. But let me offer just a few observations. First of all, the leaders and the men in every country need to understand that the countries that are most successful are going to be the countries that give opportunities to girls and women, and not just boys and men. And if you look at which countries are doing best -- most advanced, grow the fastest -- it’s partly because you can’t have half the population uneducated, not working, out of the house, not in leadership positions, and expect to be as good as a country where 100 percent of the people are getting a good education, and having opportunities, and can do amazing things -- starting a business or entering into politics or what have you. So this is not just a problem for girls and women; men have to also recognize, this is good for you. And if you’re a strong man, you shouldn’t be threatened that women are doing well. You should be proud that women are doing well. And families where women have opportunity, that means they’re going to be able to bring in more income, which means the family as a whole is going to do better. And let’s be honest, sometimes, you know, that whole machismo attitude sometimes makes it harder for women to succeed, and sometimes that is coming even from those who love them. So, men, those of you who end up being fathers and you’ve got daughters, you’ve got to lift up your daughters. Just telling them they’re pretty is not enough. You’ve got to tell them they’re smart, and you got to tell them they’re ambitious, and you have to give them opportunity. 8 So once you have the whole country thinking in those terms, then you need to start having policies that can support women, and the most important thing, in addition to making sure that girls from an early age are getting a good education and that they’re not being told, oh, you can just do certain things -- like engineering, that’s a man’s job, or being scientist, that a man’s job. No, no -- girls can do everything. It can’t just be, you know, be a teacher -- which is a wonderful profession, but, traditionally, women sometimes are just told there are a few things they can do -- nurse, teacher -- as opposed to anything. Right? So that starts -- once you’ve done that, then you have to recognize that the big conflicts that women have in the professional world has to do with family and childrearing. And for biological reasons, women have more of a burden than men do. But it’s not just biology, it’s also sociology, all right? Men’s attitudes is, well, yeah, I don’t have to do as much. And even in my marriage with Michelle, I like to think of myself as a modern, enlightened man, but I’ll admit it -- Michelle did more work than I did with Sasha and Malia. So part of what societies can do, though, is they can help with, for example, having smart policies for childcare. One of the hardest things for professional women, particularly when their children are still small and not yet in school, is who’s going to take care of my baby when I’m working, and how do I make sure that they’re safe and that they’re trusted. So making sure that governments have policies in place that help. Now, having a mother-in-law who helps, that’s also very useful. But not everybody has the option where they have family members who are close by. So that’s an example of something that we have to really work on. Then we have to put pressure on institutions to treat women equally when it comes to getting loans to start a business. Up until just maybe 20 years ago, in some places -- in the United States even -- a husband had to sign a loan document with a bank, even though it was the wife’s business, even if the woman was the one making the money, it was her idea, it was her investment, she was doing all the work. Because of these old stereotypes, you’re having men co-sign. That kind of mentality, that kind of discrimination still exists in a lot of institutions. So we have to push back against those, we have to fight against those. Women who are successful, you have to then fight for the younger women who are coming behind you, and make sure that you are changing some of these attitudes. If you are high up in a bank, then you got to make sure that these policies are good for women. If you succeed in politics, then you have to help promote and encourage women who are coming behind you. 9 So the last thing I guess I would say would be -- I know that Michelle says this to our daughters: You can be a wonderful mom and have a wonderful family and have a really successful career. You may have to kind of not try to do everything all at the same time exactly. You may have to time things out a little bit and have a husband who supports taking turns a little bit. So it may be that when the child is very young, you’re not doing something that is as hard, because having a really young child is already really hard, and you have to sleep sometimes. But then as the child gets older, maybe that’s when you are doing something -- maybe your husband is doing something that gives him more time to support that child. So there’s going to have to be finding the right balance throughout your life in order to be successful. But congratulations on the good work you’re doing. All right, I've got time for -- so I only have time for two more questions. I'll call on that gentleman up there with the glasses, in the blue shirt. No, no, right here. Let him ask his question, and then I'll ask the last one. Go ahead.","Well, thank you, thank you very much for that wonderful question. And to all you YLAI fellows, whether you're here in beautiful Peru or watching us from your homes, it's great to connect with you. That's the spirit we need – young leaders reaching out, asking important questions.

You've touched on something that is truly at the heart of so many capable women, and frankly, a core strength of any strong society: this idea of ""should I be a mother or should I be a professional?"" And I'm here to tell you, without a shadow of a doubt, you can be both. You *must* be both, if that's what's in your heart and if you have that drive.

It's not easy. Nobody's going to stand up here and tell you it's a cakewalk. It requires grit, it requires determination, and it requires a whole lot of love and smarts. I've seen it firsthand in my life, with my mother, my wife, my daughters. They are strong, capable women who've had to balance responsibilities, and they've done it with grace and strength.

So, my special advice for female entrepreneurs, for those mothers balancing so much?

First, **believe in your unique strength.** Women who are mothers, who are entrepreneurs – you're natural multi-taskers. You're problem-solvers. You're nurturers, and that empathy, that ability to care and to bring things into being, translates directly into building a successful business and a strong family. Don't ever underestimate that power.

Second, **build your team.** No one, and I mean *no one*, does it alone. This isn't just about hiring good employees for your business; it's about building a supportive network at home. A good partner, understanding family, reliable friends, and sometimes, yes, professional help with childcare or household duties. It's not a sign of weakness; it's a sign of good leadership, knowing when to delegate and leaning on those who care about you.

Third, **prioritize like crazy, and be flexible.** Life isn't a static balance; it's a constant adjustment. There will be times your business demands everything you've got, and there will be times your children need you more than anything. Be honest with yourself about what needs attention *right now*. And be kind to yourself when it's not perfect. Nobody's perfect. The goal isn't perfection; it's progress and purpose.

And finally, **remember the legacy you are building.** You are not just creating a company; you are shaping the future. You are showing your children, your communities, and indeed, the world, that women can lead, innovate, create jobs, and raise strong, principled families. You are the role models. You are showing the next generation what's possible. That is a powerful, powerful impact.

So, go out there, all you YLAI fellows, all you incredible women. Don't let anyone tell you you have to choose. You can have it all – maybe not all at the exact same moment, but you can build a life of purpose and success, both professionally and personally. Keep that fire in your belly. God bless you, and God bless your important endeavors."
" Hello, Mr. President. ",Hello!,"Well, hello there! Always a pleasure to connect with the American people. What's on your mind?"
" It's really an honor to ask you this question. Well, my name is Alonso Cornejo [ph]. I'm studying marketing at Universidad San Ignacio Loyola. And my question is about what advice will you give to Peruvian students that they are starting to think different, to making a change not just in Peru, [but] worldwide -- make a change about worldwide. What advice will you give? Right now we live in a world that maybe the bad is good, and the good is bad. So what advice will you give them to chase their dreams, make the country better -- not Peru, just worldwide? That will be my question. Thank you. ","Well, look, you're already doing so well. I don’t know that I can give you the perfect advice. But I'll tell you what I tell my young people who work in the White House and who I meet in the United States, because I think what's true in the United States is true for you, as well. 0 We live at a time where you're always seeing bad news. Everybody -- bad news gets a lot of attention. But the truth is that, in some many ways, the world is better now than it was 20 years ago or 40 years ago, or 100 years ago. People are healthier today, they're wealthier today, they're better educated today. The world, if you look overall, is less violent than it was. Look at the 20th century -- millions of people dying everywhere. Look at Latin America and the wars that were taking place everywhere across the continent. And so you actually are living in a time of relative peace and historic prosperity. And I say that so that you should feel optimistic about the future. You shouldn’t feel pessimistic. Yeah, you're always seeing bad news, but the truth is the world is in a place where it can solve its problems and be even better 20 years from now or 50 years from now. You have to start with that hope, that sense of optimism inside you, because if you don’t feel that way, then you don’t bother to try to have an impact because you think, ah, every politician is corrupt and all the governments are terrible, and people are greedy and people are mean, and so I'm just going to look out for myself. And then nothing gets better. So you have to start knowing that things have gotten better and can continue to get better. That's number one. Number two, I always tell young people to -- and I don’t know if this translates well in Spanish -- but I say: Worry more about what you want to do, and not what you want to be. Now, here is what I mean. I think a lot of people, they say to themselves, ""I want to be rich,"" or they say to themselves, ""I want to be powerful."" Or they say, ""I want to be the President,"" or ""I want to be a CEO,"" so they -- or ""I want to be a rap star."" So they say they have this idea, but the people I know who are most successful, usually they're successful because they found something that they really care about, and they worked at it and became really good at it. And over time, because they were so good at what they did, they ended up being rich, or they ended up being powerful and influential. But in the meantime, they were constantly doing what they enjoyed doing and learning, and that's what made them successful. So what I would say to all of you is, find something you care deeply about. If you care about poor children, then find a way right now that you can start helping some poor children. Don’t wait, saying to yourself, oh, someday, when I'm President of Peru I'm going to help poor children. No, go now and find an organization or create an organization that is helping poor kids learn or be exposed to new experiences. 1 If you care about the environment, don’t wait. In addition to your studies, you could start having an impact right now on trying to improve your local community, or trying to be involved in some of the work that's being done around things like climate change. The point is that once you decide what it is that you really care about, there are ways for you to now get involved and pursue that passion. And if you pursue that passion and you get good at it, you're not going to change the world overnight -- nobody does. I mean, I eventually, at the age of 45, became a senator and then the President of the United States, but I worked for 25 years in poor communities, and worked on issues. And hopefully I was doing some good, even before I was famous or powerful, so that if I hadn’t ended up being President I could still look back and say, I worked on the things that I cared about and I got something done that was important. And that, I think, is the most important advice that I have for you. All right, last question. It's a woman's turn. So all the men, you can put your -- all the boys can put their hands down. It's a woman's turn. Okay, go ahead, right there.","Well, Alonso, thank you for that great question. It's an honor to be here, and it's an honor to hear from a bright young man like yourself, studying marketing at Universidad San Ignacio Loyola.

You're asking about making a change, making the world better, chasing your dreams – and you're right, it feels like sometimes the compass is spinning, where ""bad is good"" and ""good is bad."" It's a complicated world out there, no doubt about it.

Let me tell you, it takes courage to ask that question, and it takes even more courage to live the answer. My advice, from my heart to yours, is this:

First, **always anchor yourself in strong principles.** You gotta know what's right and what's wrong. In a world that tries to confuse you, your character, your integrity – that's your true North. Don't compromise that. Ever. Stand for something real, for truth, for honesty. That's the bedrock for any lasting change.

Second, **take full advantage of your education and work hard.** You're studying marketing, that's about understanding people, understanding markets, understanding how to communicate effectively. Use that knowledge, work hard. There's no substitute for hard work, Alonso. None. The world rewards effort, and it rewards those who are prepared. Be prepared to outwork everyone else.

Third, **think big, but start local.** You talk about making a worldwide change, and that's a noble goal. But remember, worldwide change often starts right where you are. Start with your community, start with your country, Peru. Show leadership there. Be an example. Innovation, entrepreneurship – these things, they often begin by solving a problem right in front of you, and then they can spread, they can go global. Don't wait for permission to make things better around you.

Fourth, **think about service.** It's not just about what you can get, but what you can give. To your family, your community, your nation, and eventually, to the world. A life of purpose is a life of service. When you dedicate your talents to something larger than yourself, that's where true satisfaction and impact lie.

And finally, Alonso, **never lose your optimism.** The world has always had its challenges. There have always been those who try to tear down instead of build up. But I believe in the human spirit. I believe in bright young people like you. Chase those dreams with everything you've got. You're going to face setbacks, everyone does, but you pick yourself up, you learn, and you keep going. The future belongs to those who are willing to lead with purpose and integrity, who believe in the good, and are willing to fight for it.

God bless you, Alonso, and God bless Peru. You have the power to make a difference. Now go out there and do it."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You’ve been telling world leaders this week that President-elect Trump is unlikely to govern in the divisive way that he campaigned. But I'm wondering, how can you be so certain of that given that the first group of people he’s chosen for top national security and law enforcement positions hold the same views that he espoused as a candidate? And second, to follow up on your meeting earlier today with President Putin, did you discuss with him Russia’s alleged meddling in the U.S. election? And are you concerned that the kind of involvement that we saw in this year’s campaign will be the new normal going forward in future U.S. elections? ","Well, what I have said to world leaders is the same thing that I've said in a number of press conferences, which is the President-elect now has to put together a team and put forward specifics about how he intends to govern. And he hasn't had a full opportunity to do that yet. And so people should take a wait-and-see approach in how much his policy proposals once in the White House, once he is sworn in, matches up with some of the rhetoric of his campaign. My simple point is, is that you can't assume that the language of campaigning matches up with the specifics of governing, legislation, regulations, and foreign policy. I can't be sure of anything. I think, like everyone else, we'll have to wait and see. But as I've said before, once you're in the Oval Office, once you begin interacting with world leaders, once you see the complexities of the issues, that has a way of shaping your thinking and, in some cases, modifying your thinking, because you recognize this solemn responsibility not only to the American people but the solemn responsibility that America has as the largest, most powerful country in the world. And I can't guarantee that the President-elect won't pursue some of the positions that he's taken. But what I can guarantee is, is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues. That's just the way this office works. And I've said before, if these issues were easy -- if ensuring prosperity, jobs, security, good foreign relations with other countries -- if all that was simple, then it would have been done by every previous President. And I'm a pretty good presidential historian; I've looked at my 43 predecessors, and it seems like for all of them -- even the best ones -- that you end up confronting realities that you didn't anticipate. I think the same will happen here. And that's a good thing. That's an important thing. With respect to President Putin, I didn't have a meeting. We talked briefly while we were in between sessions. And the conversation that I had with him was consistent with the conversations I've had with him over the previous several months, indicating to him that we are still deeply concerned about the bloodshed and chaos that's being sown by constant bombing attacks by Assad and the Russian military against populations in Aleppo, and the need for us to arrive first at some sort of humanitarian ceasefire and begin moving towards a political transition of some sort. And I talked to him about Ukraine and the need for us to get Minsk done. I urged him to instruct his negotiators to work with ourselves, with Frances, with Germany, with Ukraine to see if we can get that done before my term is up. As usual, it was a candid and courteous meeting, but very clear about the strong differences that we have on policy. The issue of the elections did not come up because that's behind us and I was focused in this brief discussion on moving forward. I had already made very clear to him our concerns around cyberattacks, generally, as well as specific concerns we had surrounding the DNC hack. I don't think this will be the norm, but as I've said before, the concern I have has less to do with any particular misinformation or propaganda that's being put out by any particular party, and a greater concern about the general misinformation from all kinds of sources -- domestic, foreign, on social media -- that make it very difficult for voters to figure out what's true and what's not. And let me put it this way. I think if we have a strong, accurate and responsible press, and we have a strong, civic culture and an engaged citizenry, then various attempts to meddle in our elections won't mean much. If, generally, we've got elections that aren't focused on issues and are full of fake news and false information and distractions, then the issue is not going to be what's happening from the outside; the issue is going to be what are we doing for ourselves from the inside. The good news is that's something that we have control over. Gardiner Harris.","Thank you, I appreciate the questions.

First, regarding President-elect Trump and my conversations with world leaders this week. I understand the concerns many have raised based on campaign rhetoric. And it's true, a campaign is a contest of ideas, a battle of wills, and it can often be, well, quite robust. But I've always believed that the mantle of the presidency, the weight of this office, fundamentally changes a person. It imposes a solemn responsibility, a duty not to a party or a faction, but to *all* Americans. When you sit in this chair, you see the world's complexities, the stakes involved, and you realize that governing requires reaching out, building coalitions, and focusing on the core interests of our nation's security and prosperity. My conversations reflect my faith in that process, and my belief that once President-elect Trump takes the oath, he will be confronted with the serious work of uniting the country and leading it on the world stage. As for his appointments, these are serious individuals, dedicated to public service, and while they may hold strong views, I expect them to serve the nation with professionalism and commitment, upholding the institutions they are charged to protect.

Now, regarding my meeting with President Putin earlier today. Yes, we did discuss the allegations of Russia's meddling in our election. Let me be clear: foreign interference in our democratic process, from *any* nation, is a grave concern, and it is something we simply cannot tolerate. The integrity of our elections is foundational to our republic, and I made that point emphatically to President Putin. We reviewed the intelligence, and we discussed the necessary steps to ensure accountability and to deter future attempts.

Am I concerned this could be the new normal? Yes, I am. The digital age has opened new vectors for adversaries to sow discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions. This isn't just a challenge for America; it's a challenge for democracies worldwide. That's why we must remain vigilant, strengthen our cybersecurity defenses, and, crucially, stand together as a nation, united against any external efforts to divide us. This isn't a partisan issue; it's an American issue. And ensuring the sanctity of our electoral process will require sustained effort, cooperation, and a clear, unambiguous message to any who might seek to interfere: such actions will have consequences."
" Mr. President, thanks so much for holding this press conference. If you had had hotels, real estate, and other businesses distributed around the world prior to becoming President, would you have thought it appropriate to sell them off and put the cash proceeds in a blind trust? Or is it okay for the President of the United States to be personally vulnerable to the policy decisions of the foreign leaders he meets and in the foreign policy decisions he makes as President? And also, just briefly, what's your complaint about how the NSA and Cyber Command have done their job? And are you considering firing Admiral Mike Rogers? ","That was a rhetorical question, that first one. Rather than comment on hypotheticals, let me say specifically what I did. Obviously, my assets were significantly smaller than some other Presidents or President-elects. But we made a decision to liquidate assets that might raise questions about how it would influence policy. I basically had our accountant put all our money in Treasury bills -- the yields, by the way, have not been massive over the course of the last eight years -- just because it simplified my life. I did not have to worry about the complexities of whether a decision that I made might even inadvertently benefit me. And that's consistent with the broader approach that we've taken throughout my Administration, which is to not just meet the letter of the law, but to go well beyond the letter to the spirit of the law -- not just for me, but for the people in the White House and in our leadership positions. We have established a whole set of rules, norms, playbooks that just keep us far away from the line. Early on in the Administration, there would be questions about could a staff person go to this conference, or what should they do about this gift that was provided. And I think it was maybe our first general counsel who was responsible for setting up our guidelines and rules inside the White House that said, if it sounds like it would be fun, then you can't do it. That's a general test. If it sounds like something you would enjoy or appreciate -- no go. And as a consequence -- and I'll knock on some wood here, because we got two months left -- I am extremely proud of the fact that over eight years we have not had the kinds of scandals that have plagued other Administrations. And when I met with the President-elect, I suggested to him that having a strong White House Counsel that could provide clear guideposts and rules would benefit him and benefit his team because it would eliminate a lot of ambiguity. And I think it will be up to him to make determinations about how he wants to approach it. I know what worked for us, and I think it served the American people well. And because I had made a promise to the American people that I would not fall into some of the familiar habits of Washington, that I wanted a new kind of politics, this was one indicator. And at the end of eight years, I think I can say to the American people I delivered on that commitment. With respect to cyber, the NSA, Admiral Rogers is a terrific patriot and has served this country well in a number of positions. I generally don't comment on personnel matters here. I can say generally that we've spent a lot of time over the last several years looking at how we can organize our cyber efforts to keep pace with how rapidly the environment is changing. Increasingly, our critical infrastructure, government data, financial systems are vulnerable to attack. And both state and non-state actors are getting better and better at it, and it is becoming more and more rapid. And it is inevitable that we're doing to have to modernize and update not just the tools we use to defend those assets and the American people, but also how we organize it. And it is true that we are exploring a range of options in terms of how we organize the mission that currently exists. Rich Edson.","Thank you, thank you very much for being here. Good to see you all.

Let's talk about those businesses first, because it's a very important question, and frankly, it's a little bit overblown, if you ask me. When you've built a tremendous company, one of the greatest brands in the world, over many, many years, with incredible assets, selling it off entirely, completely, it's not like selling a little corner store, okay? It's very complex. And frankly, the idea that a President, *this* President, would be personally vulnerable because of successful businesses he built before taking office, it's just not true. My focus, 100%, has always been on America, on making America great. My decisions are for the American people, not for any real estate deal or anything like that. We have lawyers, tremendous lawyers, and we do everything properly, everything by the book, believe me. The country comes first. My energy, my time, my entire focus is on the United States.

Now, regarding the NSA and Cyber Command, look, we've had some tremendous challenges there, haven't we? Sometimes, frankly, things haven't gone as smoothly as they should have. We need to be the best, the *absolute best* in the world when it comes to cyber security and intelligence. We need to be stronger, smarter, faster than anybody out there because the threats are tremendous. And we're working very, very hard to make sure we have the top people and the top technology to protect our country from every angle. When you see what's happening out there, you know we need to be at the highest level of performance.

And Admiral Rogers? We are always, always, evaluating personnel. We want the best. We want winners. And in positions as critical as those, especially protecting our national security in the cyber realm, you have to have the best people, the absolute strongest people. We're always looking at who's performing at the highest level, and we'll make changes if we need to. That's just good management. We want to win, and we need people who are going to make us win. Thank you."
" Good evening, and thank you, Mr. President. Earlier this year, former President George W. Bush reportedly said that he worried he would be the last Republican President. Now Republicans have won the White House, control the House and Senate, two-thirds of state legislatures, 34 governorships, and there are charges of a shallow Democratic bench behind you. Are you worried you could be the last Democratic President for a while? And secondly, sir, speaking of your predecessor, he made sure to offer essentially no public criticism of you during your time in office. Will you equally withhold public criticism for President Trump, even if he attempts to dismantle much of what you’ve accomplished? Thank you. ","Well, no, I'm not worried about being the last Democratic President. I think -- not even for a while. And I say that, not being cute. The Democratic nominee won the popular vote, and obviously this was an extremely competitive race and I would expect that future races will be competitive as well. I certainly think it's true that politics in America right now are a little up for grabs, that some of the old alignments within both parties -- Democrat and Republican -- are being reshaped. And although the results of this election involved some of the specifics of the candidates and aren't going to be duplicated in every subsequent election, Democrats do have to do some thinking about how do we make sure that the message we have is received effectively and results in winning elections. This is something that I've been wrestling with throughout my presidency. When you look at the proposals I put forward, they garner majority support. The majority believes in raising the minimum wage. The majority believes in common-sense gun safety rules. The majority believes in investing to rebuild our infrastructure and create jobs. The majority believes in making sure that people aren't going bankrupt when they get sick. The majority agrees with all the individual components of Obamacare. I think there was a Gallup Poll this week, subsequent to the election, that showed that the general public has a more favorable view of Democrats than Republicans. And as I noted, my approval ratings are quite high. And yet what’s been true during the course of my eight years is that does not always translate; in fact, too often it hasn't translated into working majorities either at the state level or at the federal level. Now, some of that is just the nature of our system, and geography. As long as Wyoming gets the same number of senators as California, there’s going to be some tilt towards Republicans when it comes to congressional races. The fact that a lot of Democratic voters are bunched up in big cities, and a lot of Republican voters are spread out across geography gives them an advantage when it comes to congressional races. Some of it is just political bad luck. For example, I came in as an economy was in free fall, and although we took the right steps to save the economy, in my midterm election in 2010, people couldn't yet see the recovery and, not surprisingly, the President’s party got punished. We lost control of a lot of not just congressional seats but also gubernatorial seats and state legislative seats. And that happened to be the year that the Census is done and you start doing redistricting, and those Republicans took advantage of political gerrymandering to lock in majorities, even though in numerous subsequent elections, Democrats have actually cast more votes -- or more votes have been cast for Democratic congressional candidates than Republican. And yet you end up having large Republican majorities. So there are just some structural problems that we have to deal with. But, look, you can't make excuses about the rules. That's the deal, and we got to do better. And I think doing better, as I said, involves us working at the grassroots; not ceding territory; going out into areas where right now we may not stand a chance of actually winning but we're building up a cadre of young talent; we're making arguments; we're persuading; we're talking about the things that matter to ordinary people, day to day, and trying to avoid some of the constant distractions that fill up people’s Twitter accounts. And if we do that, then I'm confident that we'll be back on track. I don't think that there has to be a complete overhaul here. I think that there does have to be better organization, a smarter message. And one message I do have for Democrats is that a strategy that's just micro-targeting particular, discrete groups in a Democratic coalition sometimes will win you elections, but it's not going to win you the broad mandate that you need. And ultimately, the more we can talk about what we have in common as a nation, and speak to a broad set of values, a vision that speaks to everybody and not just one group at a time, the better off we're going to be. I think that's part of the reason why I was able to get elected twice, is that I always tried to make sure that, not only in proposals but also in message, that I was speaking to everybody. You had a second part to your question?","Well, good evening to you too, and thank you for that question. It's a thoughtful one.

Look, first on your point about whether I'm worried about the Democratic Party. You know, politics is a lot like life: it's full of cycles. There are ups, and there are downs. This was a tough election, and the American people sent a clear message. When folks are hurting, when they feel left behind, they look for change, and sometimes that means a big swing. Our party, the Democratic Party, has always been about making sure everyone has a fair shot, that we build a ladder of opportunity for everybody. And sometimes, after a loss, you have to take a good, hard look in the mirror, listen to the people, and figure out how to adapt, how to communicate our core values in a way that resonates with a changing America.

But let me tell you, I've seen this movie before. The Democratic Party is resilient. We've got deep roots in this country, and our ideas, our vision for a more inclusive, prosperous America, those are still powerful ideas. We've got a lot of talented people out there, in communities, in statehouses, who are working hard every day. We just have to make sure we're connecting, we're building that bench, and we're reminding people what we stand for. So, am I worried we'll be the last for a while? No. I have faith in the American people, and I have faith in the enduring values of our party. We'll learn, we'll grow, and we'll come back strong. That's the American way, and that's the Democratic way.

Now, on your second question, about public criticism and my successor. You know, there's a long and honorable tradition in this country, one President Bush followed, where a former President generally steps back and gives the new President the space to govern. The office of the President is bigger than any one of us, and it deserves respect. And I certainly respect that tradition.

However, being a former President also means you don't stop caring about the country, about the values you fought for, and about the progress you believe we made. If I see actions that I believe fundamentally threaten the well-being of the American people, or undermine the democratic institutions we cherish, or walk away from commitments that are vital to our security and prosperity, well, I believe I have a responsibility to speak out. Not to be critical for the sake of it, not to be partisan, but to lend my voice to the conversation when I believe it truly matters. My job, now, is to be a citizen first, and to contribute in a way that strengthens the country. And sometimes, that means speaking up, not just for my legacy, but for the future we all share."
 [Inaudible.] ,"Ah. Look, I've said before, President Bush could not have been more gracious to me when I came in. And my intention is to, certainly for the next two months, is finish my job. 0 And then, after that, to take Michelle on vacation, get some rest, spend time with my girls, and do some writing, do some thinking. So I want to be respectful of the office and give the President-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance. As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle, but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I'll examine it when it comes. But what I do know is, is that I have to take Michelle on vacation. Juliet Eilperin.","(Leaning in slightly, perhaps cupping an ear with a serious, yet genial, expression)

""I apologize, my friend, but I didn't quite catch that. The acoustics in here aren't always the best, you know. Could you, uh, could you please repeat that a little louder for me? We've got some important business to get to, and I want to make sure I heard you right."""
" Thanks, Mr. President. Given what you just said about the strong differences that you and President Putin have on the future of Syria and the conflict there, can you talk a little about how you see that unfolding, both at the end of your tenure, at the beginning of Donald Trump’s, and whether you have concerns that even if we eliminate the Islamic state in eastern Syria and western Iraq, you may be allowing a permanent al Qaeda safe haven around Aleppo and [inaudible.] And on Aleppo, can you say to what extent you think the United States has fulfilled its responsibility to protect in that instance? And then, in terms of finishing your job, which you just mentioned, last week you exercised your executive authority on multiple fronts -- finalizing oil and gas leasing rules on public lands, as well as issuing a five-year leasing plan, banning drilling in the Arctic and the Atlantic. Many Republicans say that you should hold off finalizing anymore rules as you're headed out the door because they oppose many of them -- when they control both the executive and legislative branch next year. What do you say to that suggestion? ","Well, on the second question, these are the same Republicans who suggested that they didn’t need to confirm a Supreme Court justice when I was nine months out until the next election. I think their general approach seems to be that probably two days after my reelection, I should stop until the next election. I don't think that that's what the Constitution calls for. 1 The regulations that we have issued are ones that we've been working on for a very long time. They’ve been subject to extensive public notice and comment, and everybody has known they’ve been out there. These aren't things that we've been surprising people with. They’re well-considered, they’re the right thing to do. They’re part of my task of finishing my work. And I recognize that when the new Administration comes in, and a new Congress comes in, that they will have the option of trying to undo some of those rules and regulations that we've put in place. And that's their prerogative. That's part of how democracy works. But I feel very strongly these are the right things to do, and I'm going to make sure I do them. With respect to Syria, as I said I think even on this trip in a previous press conference, I am not optimistic about the short-term prospects in Syria. Once Russia and Iran made a decision to back Assad in a brutal air campaign and essentially a pacification of Aleppo, regardless of the potential for civilian casualties, children being killed or wounded, schools or hospitals being destroyed, then it was very hard to see a way in which even a trained and committed moderate opposition could hold its ground for long periods of time. And the issue that obviously I've wrestled with for the last five years -- how involved should the United States be? What are our legal constraints in such involvement? What are our moral obligations? What are our strategic interests? Those haven't changed. I continue to believe that we did not have a legal basis for military intervention there; that it would have been a strategic mistake given the work we still had to do in Iraq, the counter-ISIL campaign, ongoing operations in Afghanistan; that we had worked tirelessly to arrive at a political transition of some sort that could alleviate the suffering and provide humanitarian access. And we will continue to do that work all the way until the last day that me and John Kerry and others have the authority to speak for the United States government. But ultimately, it takes two -- or in this case, four, or six, or eight -- to tango. And we're just not getting help or interest from those parties that are supporting Assad, and Assad, as a consequence, has been emboldened. Look, this is a man who has decided that destroying his country, turning it to rubble, and seeing its population scattered or killed was worth it for him to cling to power, when he had the option to peacefully engage in a transition that could have kept the country intact. That's his mentality. That's not a mentality we support. 2 That's a mentality that the Russians and the Iranians have been willing to support. But at this stage, we're going to need to have a change in how all parties think about this in order for us to end the situation there. Now, our ability to go after ISIL I think can be sustained. There’s no doubt that there will continue to be extremist forces in and around Syria because it's still going to be in chaos for quite some time. There will be elements in Iraq, just as there have been elements in Afghanistan even after the Taliban we're swept out, even after we killed bin Laden. But I think we can effectively reduce the risk and take their key external operators off the field. The thing I'm probably most concerned about is making sure that even as we do that, U.S. policy, U.S. statements, U.S. positions don't further radicalize Muslims around the world, or alienate and potentially law-abiding Muslims who are living in Europe or the United States. And that's why I think it's important for us to understand those are our key allies in this fight, not enemies. Mike Memoli.","Well, thank you for that, and that's a whole barrel of important questions, isn't it? Let's take 'em one by one, because they touch on some of the toughest challenges a President faces, both on the global stage and right here at home.

First, on Syria, and the strong differences with Mr. Putin. Look, my view has always been clear: the future of Syria belongs to the Syrian people, not to a dictator who gasses his own citizens, and certainly not to radical thugs like ISIS or Al Qaeda. President Putin, he sees things through a different lens. He's concerned with power, with influence in the region, and with propping up allies, no matter how brutal. That's a fundamental difference in how we view the world, in how we view humanity.

As for how it'll unfold... well, it's going to be a long, tough road. Getting rid of ISIS, that's a critical step, and a necessary one. They are barbarians, and they must be defeated. But simply eliminating ISIS doesn't solve the problem, does it? If you leave a power vacuum, or if the underlying grievances aren't addressed, then something else will fill that void. And yes, you're right to raise the concern about a permanent Al Qaeda safe haven around Aleppo and elsewhere. We saw after Afghanistan in the 80s, when we walked away, what can happen. Al Qaeda is a persistent, adaptable enemy. They metastasize. If we don't have a strategy that deals with the conditions that allow these groups to recruit and fester – that means a political solution, humanitarian aid, and sustained pressure on terrorists – then we'll be fighting this fight forever. This is a generational struggle, and it's going to be inherited by President Trump, just as I inherited challenges and passed some along. The fundamental issue for him, and for America, will be finding a balance between our national security interests and our moral responsibilities, without getting bogged down in endless conflicts we can't resolve.

On Aleppo, and the responsibility to protect… that's a heartbreaking chapter in recent history, isn't it? When you see images like that, when you hear the stories of what those people have endured, it wrenches your gut. The responsibility to protect is a noble idea, a powerful idea. But executing it, knowing when and how and with what means you intervene without making things worse, without getting entangled in a conflict that costs countless American lives and treasure… that's the impossible choice a President has to make. The truth is, without a clear international mandate, without a willing coalition, and without a viable path to a better outcome, America's ability to simply walk in and fix every atrocity around the world is limited. We provided humanitarian aid, we tried diplomatic pressure, but a full-scale military intervention to enforce R2P in that kind of civil war is an enormous undertaking, fraught with peril. We've learned some hard lessons about intervention, and the long-term consequences. I believe we always tried to fulfill our responsibilities, but sometimes, the world presents us with tragedies that defy easy solutions.

And finally, on finishing the job, exercising executive authority at the end of a term. Look, when I raised my hand and took that oath, I swore to protect and defend the Constitution, and to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, for my full four years, or eight years. My job doesn't end until noon on Inauguration Day. Every decision made is done so after careful consideration, with the best advice from my team, and with an eye towards what I believe is in the long-term best interest of the American people, and the security of this country. On those energy and environmental regulations, we tried to strike a balance – developing our resources responsibly, protecting some of our most precious natural treasures for future generations. Some folks will always disagree, and that's their right. We live in a democracy. But I was elected to lead, to make decisions, and I'll continue to do so until the very last minute of my presidency. The incoming administration will have its own mandate, its own priorities, and it will pursue them. That's the way our system works. But my job is to finish strong, to steward the country as best I know how, right up until the hand-off.

Thank you."
" Thank you, Mr. President. There’s a perception that you're letting President Putin get away with interfering in the U.S. election, and that a response that nobody knows about or a lookback review just won’t cut it. Are you prepared to call out President Putin by name for ordering this hacking? And do you agree with what Hillary Clinton now says, that the hacking was actually partly responsible for her loss? And is your Administration’s open quarreling with Trump and his team on this issue tarnishing the smooth transition of power that you have promised? ","Well, first of all, with respect to the transition, I think they would be the first to acknowledge that we have done everything we can to make sure that they are successful as I promised. And that will continue. And it’s just been a few days since I last talked to the President-elect about a whole range of transition issues. That cooperation is going to continue. There hasn’t been a lot of squabbling. What we’ve simply said is the facts, which are that, based on uniform intelligence assessments, the Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC, and that, as a consequence, it is important for us to review all elements of that and make sure that we are preventing that kind of interference through cyberattacks in the future. That should be a bipartisan issue; that shouldn’t be a partisan issue. And my hope is that the President-elect is going to similarly be concerned with making sure that we don’t have potential foreign influence in our election process. I don’t think any American wants that. And that shouldn’t be a source of an argument. I think that part of the challenge is that it gets caught up in the carryover from election season. And I think it is very important for us to distinguish between the politics of the election and the need for us, as a country, both from a national security perspective but also in terms of the integrity of our election system and our democracy, to make sure that we don’t create a political football here. Now, with respect to how this thing unfolded last year, let’s just go through the facts pretty quickly. At the beginning of the summer, we’re alerted to the possibility that the DNC has been hacked, and I immediately order law enforcement as well as our intelligence teams to find out everything about it, investigate it thoroughly, to brief the potential victims of this hacking, to brief on a bipartisan basis the leaders of both the House and the Senate and the relevant intelligence committees. And once we had clarity and certainty around what, in fact, had happened, we publicly announced that, in fact, Russia had hacked into the DNC. And at that time, we did not attribute motives or any interpretations of why they had done so. We didn’t discuss what the effects of it might be. We simply let people know -- the public know, just as we had let members of Congress know -- that this had happened. And as a consequence, all of you wrote a lot of stories about both what had happened, and then you interpreted why that might have happened and what effect it was going to have on the election outcomes. We did not. And the reason we did not was because in this hyper- partisan atmosphere, at a time when my primary concern was making sure that the integrity of the election process was not in any way damaged, at a time when anything that was said by me or anybody in the White House would immediately be seen through a partisan lens, I wanted to make sure that everybody understood we were playing this thing straight -- that we weren’t trying to advantage one side or another, but what we were trying to do was let people know that this had taken place, and so if you started seeing effects on the election, if you were trying to measure why this was happening and how you should consume the information that was being leaked, that you might want to take this into account. And that's exactly how we should have handled it. Imagine if we had done the opposite. It would have become immediately just one more political scrum. And part of the goal here was to make sure that we did not do the work of the leakers for them by raising more and more questions about the integrity of the election right before the election was taking place -- at a time, by the way, when the President-elect himself was raising questions about the integrity of the election. And, finally, I think it's worth pointing out that the information was already out. It was in the hands of WikiLeaks, so that was going to come out no matter what. What I was concerned about, in particular, was making sure that that wasn’t compounded by potential hacking that could hamper vote counting, affect the actual election process itself. And so in early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn’t happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out, and there were going to be some serious consequences if he didn’t. And, in fact, we did not see further tampering of the election process. But the leaks through WikiLeaks had already occurred. So when I look back in terms of how we handled it, I think we handled it the way it should have been handled. We allowed law enforcement and the intelligence community to do its job without political influence. We briefed all relevant parties involved in terms of what was taking place. When we had a consensus around what had happened, we announced it -- not through the White House, not through me, but rather through the intelligence communities that had actually carried out these investigations. And then we allowed you and the American public to make an assessment as to how to weigh that going into the election. And the truth is, is that there was nobody here who didn’t have some sense of what kind of effect it might have. I'm finding it a little curious that everybody is suddenly acting surprised that this looked like it was disadvantaging Hillary Clinton because you guys wrote about it every day. Every single leak. About every little juicy tidbit of political gossip -- including John Podesta's risotto recipe. This was an obsession that dominated the news coverage. So I do think it's worth us reflecting how it is that a presidential election of such importance, of such moment, with so many big issues at stake and such a contrast between the candidates, came to be dominated by a bunch of these leaks. What is it about our political system that made us vulnerable to these kinds of potential manipulations -- which, as I've said publicly before, were not particularly sophisticated. This was not some elaborate, complicated espionage scheme. They hacked into some Democratic Party emails that contained pretty routine stuff, some of it embarrassing or uncomfortable, because I suspect that if any of us got our emails hacked into, there might be some things that we wouldn’t want suddenly appearing on the front page of a newspaper or a telecast, even if there wasn’t anything particularly illegal or controversial about it. And then it just took off. And that concerns me. And it should concern all of us. But the truth of the matter is, is that everybody had the information. It was out there. And we handled it the way we should have. Now, moving forward, I think there are a couple of issues that this raises. Number one is just the constant challenge that we are going to have with cybersecurity throughout our economy and throughout our society. We are a digitalized culture, and there is hacking going on every single day. There’s not a company, there’s not a major organization, there’s not a financial institution, there’s not a branch of our government where somebody is not going to be phishing for something or trying to penetrate, or put in a virus or malware. And this is why for the last eight years, I’ve been obsessed with how do we continually upgrade our cybersecurity systems. And this particular concern around Russian hacking is part of a broader set of concerns about how do we deal with cyber issues being used in ways that can affect our infrastructure, affect the stability of our financial systems, and affect the integrity of our institutions, like our election process. I just received a couple weeks back -- it wasn’t widely reported on -- a report from our cybersecurity commission that outlines a whole range of strategies to do a better job on this. But it’s difficult, because it’s not all housed -- the target of cyberattacks is not one entity but it’s widely dispersed, and a lot of it is private, like the DNC. It’s not a branch of government. We can’t tell people what to do. What we can do is inform them, get best practices. What we can also do is to, on a bilateral basis, warn other countries against these kinds of attacks. And we’ve done that in the past. So just as I told Russia to stop it, and indicated there will be consequences when they do it, the Chinese have, in the past, engaged in cyberattacks directed at our companies to steal trade secrets and proprietary technology. And I had to have the same conversation with Prime Minister -- or with President Xi, and what we’ve seen is some evidence that they have reduced -- but not completely eliminated -- these activities, partly because they can use cutouts. One of the problems with the Internet and cyber issues is that there’s not always a return address, and by the time you catch up to it, attributing what happened to a particular government can be difficult, not always provable in court even though our intelligence communities can make an assessment. What we’ve also tried to do is to start creating some international norms about this to prevent some sort of cyber arms race, because we obviously have offensive capabilities as well as defensive capabilities. And my approach is not a situation in which everybody is worse off because folks are constantly attacking each other back and forth, but putting some guardrails around the behavior of nation-states, including our adversaries, just so that they understand that whatever they do to us we can potentially do to them. We do have some special challenges, because oftentimes our economy is more digitalized, it is more vulnerable, partly because we’re a wealthier nation and we’re more wired than some of these other countries. And we have a more open society, and engage in less control and censorship over what happens over the Internet, which is also part of what makes us special. Last point -- and the reason I’m going on here is because I know that you guys have a lot of questions about this, and I haven't addressed all of you directly about it. With respect to response, my principal goal leading up to the election was making sure that the election itself went off without a hitch, that it was not tarnished, and that it did not feed any sense in the public that somehow tampering had taken place with the actual process of voting. And we accomplished that. That does not mean that we are not going to respond. It simply meant that we had a set of priorities leading up to the election that were of the utmost importance. Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us, because we can do stuff to you. But it is also important for us to do that in a thoughtful, methodical way. Some of it we do publicly. Some of it we will do in a way that they know, but not everybody will. And I know that there have been folks out there who suggest somehow that if we went out there and made big announcements, and thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spook the Russians. But keep in mind that we already have enormous numbers of sanctions against the Russians. The relationship between us and Russia has deteriorated, sadly, significantly over the last several years. And so how we approach an appropriate response that increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future, but does not create problems for us, is something that’s worth taking the time to think through and figure out. And that’s exactly what we’ve done. So at a point in time where we’ve taken certain actions that we can divulge publically, we will do so. There are times where the message will go -- will be directly received by the Russians and not publicized. And I should point out, by the way, part of why the Russians have been effective on this is because they don't go around announcing what they're doing. It's not like Putin is going around the world publically saying, look what we did, wasn't that clever? He denies it. So the idea that somehow public shaming is going to be effective I think doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well. Okay?","Thank you for those questions. Let me address them head-on.

First, regarding President Putin and any interference: Let me be absolutely clear. The United States will not tolerate any foreign meddling in our democratic process, from any nation or any entity. We have sophisticated intelligence capabilities, and our agencies are working tirelessly to ascertain the full scope of any activity. When we have the complete picture, and when we determine the most effective course of action, we will respond. And let me assure you, that response will be decisive, it will be appropriate, and it will be at a time and place of our choosing. We don't telegraph our punches, but we do deliver them. Protecting the integrity of our elections and the security of our nation is my highest priority.

Second, concerning what Secretary Clinton has said about the election results: Look, the American people have spoken. Our elections are the bedrock of our republic, and the outcome reflects the will of the voters. It's time for us to move forward, united as a country, and focus on the challenges ahead. My administration is dedicated to ensuring a strong America, both at home and abroad, and that's where my focus lies, not on re-litigating past campaigns.

And finally, about the transition: Transitions of power in this great nation are always robust. When you're talking about the leadership of the free world, it's natural for there to be spirited discussions and diverse viewpoints. But let me assure you, the professionals within this administration and those coming into the next are dedicated to ensuring a smooth, seamless, and secure transfer of power. We are committed to safeguarding the national interest, and that mission remains paramount above all else. We are getting the job done, and we will ensure the next administration is fully prepared on day one."
 Did Clinton lose because of the hacking? ,"I'm going to let all the political pundits in this town have a long discussion about what happened in the election. It was a fascinating election, so I'm sure there are going to be a lot of books written about it. I've said what I think is important for the Democratic Party going forward rather than try to parse every aspect of the election. And I've said before, I couldn't be prouder of Secretary Clinton, her outstanding service. I thinks she's worked tirelessly on behalf of the American people, and I don't think she was treated fairly during the election. I think the coverage of her and the issues was troubling. But having said that, what I've been most focused on -- appropriate for the fact that I'm not going to be a politician in about, what is it, 32 days? 31?","Look, the idea that Crooked Hillary lost because of some ""hacking"" is just another one of those excuses, a total hoax, frankly. It was a witch hunt from day one!

The truth is, she lost because she was a very flawed candidate, a disaster, who didn't connect with the American people. She had bad policies, nobody liked her, and she didn't even campaign in key states! I went everywhere, spoke to millions of incredible patriots. She didn't. Simple.

We won by a tremendous margin, a movement like the world has never seen before. The people spoke. They wanted to Make America Great Again, and they saw through all the fake news and the excuses. It wasn't hacking, believe me. It was common sense and the will of the voters!"
 Thirty-four. ,"Thirty four? But what I've said is, is that I can maybe give some counsel and advice to the Democratic Party. And I think that that the thing we have to spend the most time on -- because it's the thing we have the most control over -- is how do we make sure that we are showing up in places where I think Democratic policies are needed, where they are helping, where they are making a difference, but where people feel as if they're not being heard and where Democrats are characterized as coastal, liberal, latte- sipping, politically-correct, out-of-touch folks. We have to be in those communities. And I've seen that when we are in those communities, it makes a difference. 0 That's how I became President. I became a U.S. senator not just because I had a strong base in Chicago, but because I was driving around downstate Illinois and going to fish frys and sitting in VFW halls and talking to farmers. And I didn't win every one of their votes, but they got a sense of what I was talking about, what I cared about, that I was for working people, that I was for the middle class, that the reason I was interested in strengthening unions, and raising the minimum wage, and rebuilding our infrastructure, and making sure that parents had decent childcare and family leave was because my own family's history wasn't that different from theirs, even if I looked a little bit different. Same thing in Iowa. And so the question is, how do we rebuild that party as a whole so that there's not a county in any state -- I don't care how red -- that we don't have a presence and we're not making the argument. Because I think we have the better argument. But that requires a lot of work. It's been something that I've been able to do successfully in my own campaigns. It is not something I've been able to transfer to candidates in midterms and sort of build a sustaining organization around. That's something that I would have liked to have done more of, but it's kind of hard to do when you're also dealing with a whole bunch of issues here in the White House. And that doesn't mean, though, that it can't be done. And I think there are going to be a lot of talented folks out there, a lot of progressives who share my values who are going to be leading the charge in the years to come. Michelle Kosinski of CNN.","Thirty-four. Alright, that's a number. What are we talking about here? Is that a vote count on the Hill, a section of an appropriations bill, or perhaps a historical marker? We always need the context, folks."
" Thank you. So this week we heard Hillary Clinton talk about how she thinks that the FBI Director's most recent announcement made a difference in the outcome of the election. And we also just heard in an op-ed her campaign chairman talk about something being deeply broken within the FBI. He talked about thinking that the investigation early on was lackadaisical in his words. So what do you think about those comments? Do you think there's any truth to them? Do you think there's a danger there that they're calling into question the integrity of institutions in a similar way that Donald Trump's team has done? 1 And the second part to that is that Donald Trump's team repeatedly -- I guess, giving the indication that the investigation of the Russian hack, as well as the retaliation, might not be such a priority once he's in office, so what do you think the risk is there? And are you going to talk to him directly about some of those comments he made? ","Well, on the latter point, as I said before, the transition from election season to governance season is not always smooth. It's bumpy. There are still feelings that are raw out there. There are people who are still thinking about how things unfolded. And I get all that. But when Donald Trump takes the Oath of Office and is sworn as the 45th President of the United States, then he's got a different set of responsibilities and considerations. And I've said this before: I think there is a sobering process when you walk into the Oval Office. And I haven’t shared previously private conversations I've had with the President- elect. I will say that they have been cordial and, in some cases, have involved me making some pretty specific suggestions about how to ensure that regardless of our obvious deep disagreements about policy, maybe I can transmit some thoughts about maintaining the effectiveness, integrity, cohesion of the office, of various democratic institutions. And he has listened. I can't say that he will end up implementing, but the conversations themselves have been cordial as opposed to defensive in any way. And I will always make myself available to him, just as previous Presidents have made themselves available to me as issues come up. With respect to the FBI, I will tell you, I've had a chance to know a lot of FBI agents, I know Director Comey, and they take their job seriously, they work really hard, they help keep us safe and save a lot of lives. And it is always a challenge for law enforcement when there's an intersection between the work that they are doing and the political system. It's one of the difficulties of democracy, generally. We have a system where we want our law enforcement investigators and our prosecutors to be free from politics, to be independent, to play it straight, but sometimes that involves investigations that touch on politics. And particularly in this hyper-partisan environment that we've been in, everything is suspect, everything you do one way or the other. 2 One thing that I have done is to be pretty scrupulous about not wading into investigation decisions or prosecution decisions, or decisions not to prosecute. I have tried to be really strict in my own behavior about preserving the independence of law enforcement, free from my own judgments and political assessments, in some cases. And I don’t know why it would stop now. Mike Dorning of Bloomberg.","Well, look, these are serious comments, and they touch on something very fundamental: the public trust in our institutions, and the very integrity of our democratic process.

First, regarding Secretary Clinton's remarks and those of her campaign chairman about the FBI. Secretary Clinton and her team certainly have every right to analyze what they believe contributed to the outcome of the election. And it's undeniable that the timing of those FBI announcements regarding her emails was, shall we say, unusual, and it certainly became a significant part of the political narrative in the final days of the campaign.

However, when we start talking about the FBI being ""deeply broken"" or investigations being ""lackadaisical,"" we need to be very, very careful. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is a cornerstone of our justice system, and its integrity is vital to the rule of law in this country. While no institution is perfect and all should be subject to appropriate oversight and scrutiny, making broad accusations without concrete evidence can indeed erode public confidence in those institutions. And yes, to answer your question directly, when anyone — from any political persuasion — starts to fundamentally call into question the integrity of our core national institutions, it does carry a significant danger. It's a slippery slope, and it's a path that, over time, can weaken the very foundations of our republic. We need to be able to trust our institutions to operate impartially, and constant, generalized accusations, without strong justification, can make that trust very difficult to maintain.

Now, regarding the statements from the President-elect's team about the Russian hack investigation and the prospect of it not being a priority once he's in office... let me be absolutely clear. The notion that a foreign power interfered with our democratic process, or sought to influence an American election, is profoundly serious. This is not a partisan issue; this is a matter of national security and the sovereignty of the United States of America.

To downplay such an investigation, or to suggest it wouldn't be a priority, would be deeply concerning and, frankly, a dereliction of duty. We need to understand exactly what happened, who was responsible, and what steps are necessary to prevent any future interference. Our intelligence agencies exist to protect us from these very threats, and we must listen to what they're telling us.

As a former president, my primary concern has always been, and will always be, the safety and security of the American people and the integrity of our nation. If given the opportunity, I would absolutely talk to President-elect Trump directly about this. I would impress upon him the gravity of foreign interference, the importance of listening to and trusting our intelligence community, and the absolute necessity of making this investigation a top priority, not just for accountability, but to send an unequivocal message to any adversary that meddling in American democracy will not be tolerated. This is about protecting our country, our democratic values, and our constitutional order, and that always comes first."
" Thank you, Mr. President. On Aleppo, your views that what happens there is the responsibility of the Russian government, the Iranian government, the Assad regime are pretty well aired. But do you, as President of the United States, leader of the free world, feel any personal moral responsibility now at the end of your presidency for the carnage that we’re all watching in Aleppo, which I’m sure disturbs you -- which you said disturbs you? And, secondly, also on Aleppo, you’ve again made clear your practical disagreements with the idea of safe zones. And President-elect Trump has, throughout his campaign, and he said again last night that he wants to create safe zones in Syria. Do you feel like, in this transition, you need to help him toward implementing that? Or was that not something that you should be doing? ","Mike, I always feel responsible. I felt responsible when kids were being shot by snipers. I felt responsible when millions of people had been displaced. I feel responsible for murder and slaughter that’s taken place in South Sudan that’s not being reported on partly because there’s not as much social media being generated from there. There are places around the world where horrible things are happening, and because of my office, because I’m President of the United States, I feel responsible. I ask myself every single day, is there something I could do that would save lives and make a difference and spare some child who doesn’t deserve to suffer. So that’s a starting point. There’s not a moment during the course of this presidency where I haven’t felt some responsibility. That’s true, by the way, for our own country. When I came into office and people were losing their jobs and losing their homes and losing their pensions, I felt responsible, and I would go home at night and I would ask myself, was there something 3 better that I could do or smarter that I could be that would make a difference in their lives, that would relieve their suffering and relieve their hardship. So with respect to Syria, what I have consistently done is taken the best course that I can to try to end the civil war while having also to take into account the long-term national security interests of the United States. And throughout this process, based on hours of meetings, if you tallied it up, days or weeks of meetings where we went through every option in painful detail, with maps, and we had our military, and we had our aid agencies, and we had our diplomatic teams, and sometimes we’d bring in outsiders who were critics of ours -- whenever we went through it, the challenge was that, short of putting large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground, uninvited, without any international law mandate, without sufficient support from Congress, at a time when we still had troops in Afghanistan and we still had troops in Iraq, and we had just gone through over a decade of war and spent trillions of dollars, and when the opposition on the ground was not cohesive enough to necessarily govern a country, and you had a military superpower in Russia prepared to do whatever it took to keeps its client-state involved, and you had a regional military power in Iran that saw their own vital strategic interests at stake and were willing to send in as many of their people or proxies to support the regime -- that in that circumstance, unless we were all in and willing to take over Syria, we were going to have problems, and that everything else was tempting because we wanted to do something and it sounded like the right thing to do, but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap. And in that circumstance, I have to make a decision as President of the United States as to what is best -- I’m sorry, what’s going on? Somebody’s not feeling good? All right. Why don’t we have -- we’ve got -- we can get our doctors back there to help out. Does somebody want to go to my doctor’s office and just have them -- all right -- where was I?","That's a profoundly important question, and it's one that weighs heavily on my mind, and frankly, on the conscience of every American. The images, the stories coming out of Aleppo, they are devastating. And every single day, as President, you carry the weight of human suffering across the globe. What's happening there, it's a stain on humanity, a truly barbaric tragedy. My heart, our nation's heart, goes out to those innocent men, women, and children who are caught in the middle of it.

We have, from day one, pursued every available avenue: leading the largest humanitarian response in history, providing billions of dollars in aid, imposing sanctions on the regime and its backers, and tirelessly pushing for a diplomatic solution. We have worked with our allies to isolate those responsible and to try and create pathways for peace. But let me be absolutely clear: the primary responsibility for this carnage lies squarely with the Assad regime, with Iran, and with Russia. They have chosen a path of brutality, of targeting civilians, and of obstructing humanitarian aid. We have acted consistently with our values and our interests, always mindful of the complexities and the potential for unintended consequences in a region as volatile as the Middle East. We've done everything we can, short of a full-scale military intervention that many cautioned against, to address this crisis.

Now, as for safe zones, President-elect Trump has laid out his vision, and we understand his desire to protect innocent lives. We've had extensive discussions about this idea throughout my presidency, and we've been very clear about the significant challenges involved. Creating a truly safe zone, one that protects innocent lives, it requires an enormous commitment of resources: airpower to protect it, ground troops to secure it, humanitarian access, and critically, a willingness to confront and potentially engage militarily with those who would violate it – including the Assad regime and, frankly, the Russian air force. These are not minor considerations. These are monumental decisions that carry immense risks for our own brave servicemen and women, and for the stability of the entire region.

As for the transition, my administration is absolutely committed to ensuring a smooth and orderly handover. President-elect Trump and his team will have full access to all the intelligence, all the operational assessments, all the expert advice from our military and diplomatic professionals. We will brief them thoroughly on all the considerations, all the pros and cons, all the risks we've identified regarding safe zones, as well as every other major foreign policy challenge. Ultimately, it will be up to the incoming administration to make their own decisions, but they will do so with the benefit of all the information, all the strategic thinking, and all the lessons learned that we possess. That's our duty, and we will fulfill it."
 Doing it on the cheap. ,"So we couldn’t do it on the cheap. Now, it may be -- Can somebody help out please and get Doc Jackson in here? Is somebody grabbing our doctor? 4","Now, hold on a minute there. ""Doing it on the cheap""? What we're doing is being fiscally responsible, plain and simple. We're cutting the waste, draining the swamp, and making sure every single taxpayer dollar works its hardest for the American people.

It ain't about being cheap, it's about being *smart*, being *efficient*, and getting a whole lot done for less. We're getting incredible results, believe me, incredible results, and we're doing it better and smarter than anyone ever thought possible. That's good governance, folks, and that's how we're going to keep this economy roaring and this nation strong!"
" Thank you, Mr. President, for stopping. ","Of course. In the meantime, just give her a little room. The doctor will be here in a second. You guys know where the doctor’s office is? Just go through the Palm doors. It’s right next to the Map Room. There he is. All right, there’s Doc Jackson. He’s all right. Okay. The doctor is in the house.","My pleasure, my pleasure. Believe me, it's always my honor to be out here, talking to the real Americans. We're doing a tremendous job, the best job, and it's because of great patriots like you. Thank you."
 You were saying you couldn’t do it on the cheap. ,"And I don’t mean that -- I mean that with all sincerity. I understand the impulse to want to do something. But ultimately, what I’ve had to do is to think about what can we sustain, what is realistic. And my first priority has to be what’s the right thing to do for America. And it has been our view that the best thing to do has been to provide some support to the moderate opposition so that they could sustain themselves, and that we wouldn’t see anti- Assad regime sentiments just pouring into al Nusra and al Qaeda or ISIL; that we engaged our international partners in order to put pressure on all the parties involved, and to try to resolve this through diplomatic and political means. I cannot claim that we’ve been successful. And so that’s something that, as is true with a lot of issues and problems around the world, I have to go to bed with every night. But I continue to believe that it was the right approach, given what realistically we could get done absent a decision, as I said, to go in a much more significant way. And that, I think, would not have been sustainable or good for the American people because we had a whole host of other obligations that we also had to meet, wars we had already started and that were not yet finished. With respect to the issue of safe zones, it is a continued problem. A continued challenge with safe zones is if you’re setting up those zones on Syrian territory, then that requires some force that is willing to maintain that territory in the absence of consent from the Syrian government and, now, the Russians or the Iranians. So it may be that with Aleppo’s tragic situation unfolding, that in the short term, if we can get more of the tens of thousands who are still trapped there out, that so long as the world’s eyes are on them and they are feeling pressure, the regime and Russia concludes that they are willing to find some arrangement, 5 perhaps in coordination with Turkey, whereby those people can be safe. Even that will probably be temporary, but at least it solves a short-term issue that’s going to arise. Unfortunately, we’re not even there yet, because right now we have Russians and Assad claiming that basically all the innocent civilians who were trapped in Aleppo are out when international organizations, humanitarian organizations who know better and who are on the ground have said unequivocally that there are still tens of thousands who are trapped and prepared to leave under pretty much any conditions. And so right now, our biggest priority is to continue to put pressure wherever we can to try to get them out.","Precisely. And let me tell you, when you're talking about the things that truly matter for this great nation – things like our national security, the education of our children, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, or ensuring America remains the undisputed leader on the global stage – you simply cannot afford to cut corners.

You try to do it on the cheap, and what do you get? You get a second-rate defense, schools that don't prepare our kids for the future, and bridges that crumble. That's not the American way. We're about strength, quality, and investing in our future. It's not an expense; it's an absolute necessity for our prosperity and for keeping America strong."
 Notwithstanding -- ,I can’t have too much --,"Notwithstanding some of the difficulties and disagreements we might encounter, and believe me, those are always gonna be there in a vibrant democracy like ours, we've got to keep our eyes on the prize, folks. We've got to focus on what unites us, on building a stronger future for all Americans. That's what we did, and that's what we always ought to be doing."
" On the second question, your intentions are well aired, but do you feel responsibility notwithstanding a move in that direction or help President-elect Trump move in that direction? ","I will help President Trump -- President-elect Trump with any advice, counsel, information that we can provide so that he, once he’s sworn in, can make a decision. Between now and then, these are decisions that I have to make based on the consultations I have with our military and the people who have been working this every single day. Peter Alexander.","Well, thank you for that follow-up. When you've had the privilege of sitting in the Oval Office, that sense of responsibility to the American people, it never truly leaves you. It's etched into your very being. So, yes, absolutely, I feel that responsibility. My intentions have always been, and will always be, geared towards the strength and prosperity of this nation.

As for helping President-elect Trump move in any particular direction, my door is always open. It's the duty of any former President to offer counsel, to share lessons learned, and to lend support wherever it can serve the country. This isn't about party; it's about making sure that the United States continues to lead and thrive. If the direction is one that strengthens our economy, secures our borders, or projects American leadership in the world, then you can count on my full support and whatever experience I can bring to bear."
" Mr. President, thank you very much. Can you, given all the intelligence that we have now heard, assure the public that this was, once and for all, a free and fair election? And specifically on Russia, do you feel any obligation now, as they’ve been insisting that this isn’t the case, to show the proof, as it were -- they say put your money where your mouth is and declassify some of the intelligence, some of the evidence that exists? And more broadly, as it relates to Donald Trump on this very topic, are you concerned about his relationship with Vladimir Putin, especially given some of the recent Cabinet picks, including his selection for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, who toasted Putin with champagne over oil deals together? Thank you. 6 ","I may be getting older, because these multipart questions, I start losing track. I can assure the public that there was not the kind of tampering with the voting process that was of concern and will continue to be of concern going forward; that the votes that were cast were counted, they were counted appropriately. We have not seen evidence of machines being tampered with. So that assurance I can provide. That doesn’t mean that we find every single potential probe of every single voting machine all across the country, but we paid a lot of attention to it. We worked with state officials, et cetera, and we feel confident that that didn’t occur and that the votes were cast and they were counted. So that’s on that point. What was the second one?","Alright, thank you for that question. It's an important one, and one that's on a lot of folks' minds.

First, let me be absolutely clear: The American election system is the bedrock of our democracy. We have a robust process, built on the shoulders of generations of Americans, and while there are always challenges and improvements to be made, the will of the American people, expressed through the ballot box, is what determines who leads this nation. We take the integrity of our elections very seriously, and we're always working to ensure they are free, fair, and secure. That's a fundamental principle we must always uphold.

Now, regarding the intelligence we gather and the insistence from Russia... look, my job, and the job of our intelligence community, is to protect the American people and our national interests. We collect intelligence, we analyze it, and we act on it. We don't declassify sensitive information simply to satisfy the demands of foreign adversaries, particularly those who have clearly demonstrated a willingness to undermine democratic processes. Our intelligence assets, our methods, our sources – these are vital to our national security, and we will not compromise them. We know what we know, and the world knows what Russia has been up to. Our focus is on making sure it doesn't happen again, not on playing a public relations game with those who seek to destabilize us.

And concerning the relationship with President Trump and President Putin, and indeed the selection of Secretary Tillerson... every President, past and present, has to choose their cabinet and manage our nation's foreign policy as they see fit. But let me say this: American foreign policy must always, *always* be guided by American interests. We must stand firm with our allies, we must be vigilant against our adversaries, and we must protect our nation's security and prosperity above all else. Business dealings are one thing, but when you sit in the Oval Office, your allegiance is to the American people and the defense of freedom around the world. That principle must never be forgotten."
 The second one was about declassification. ,"Declassification. Look, we will provide evidence that we can safely provide that does not compromise sources and methods. But I’ll be honest with you, when you’re talking about cybersecurity, a lot of it is classified. And we’re not going to provide it because the way we catch folks is by knowing certain things about them that they may not want us to know, and if we’re going to monitor this stuff effectively going forward, we don’t want them to know that we know. So this is one of those situations where unless the American people genuinely think that the professionals in the CIA, the FBI, our entire intelligence infrastructure -- many of whom, by the way, served in previous Administrations and who are Republicans -- are less trustworthy than the Russians, then people should pay attention to what our intelligence agencies have to say. This is part of what I meant when I said that we’ve got to think about what’s happening to our political culture here. The Russians can’t change us or significantly weaken us. They are a smaller country. They are a weaker country. Their economy doesn’t produce anything that anybody wants to buy, except oil and gas and arms. They don’t innovate. 7 But they can impact us if we lose track of who we are. They can impact us if we abandon our values. Mr. Putin can weaken us, just like he’s trying to weaken Europe, if we start buying into notions that it’s okay to intimidate the press, or lock up dissidents, or discriminate against people because of their faith or what they look like. And what I worry about more than anything is the degree to which, because of the fierceness of the partisan battle, you start to see certain folks in the Republican Party and Republican voters suddenly finding a government and individuals who stand contrary to everything that we stand for as being okay because that’s how much we dislike Democrats. I mean, think about it. Some of the people who historically have been very critical of me for engaging with the Russians and having conversations with them also endorsed the President- elect, even as he was saying that we should stop sanctioning Russia and being tough on them, and work together with them against our common enemies. He was very complimentary of Mr. Putin personally. That wasn’t news. The President-elect during the campaign said so. And some folks who had made a career out of being anti-Russian didn’t say anything about it. And then after the election, suddenly they’re asking, well, why didn’t you tell us that maybe the Russians were trying to help our candidate? Well, come on. There was a survey, some of you saw, where -- now, this is just one poll, but a pretty credible source -- 37 percent of Republican voters approve of Putin. Over a third of Republican voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB. Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave. And how did that happen? It happened in part because, for too long, everything that happens in this town, everything that’s said is seen through the lens of ""does this help or hurt us relative to Democrats, or relative to President Obama?"" And unless that changes, we’re going to continue to be vulnerable to foreign influence, because we’ve lost track of what it is that we’re about and what we stand for. With respect to the President-elect’s appointments, it is his prerogative, as I’ve always said, for him to appoint who he thinks can best carry out his foreign policy or his domestic policy. It is up to the Senate to advise and consent. There will be plenty of time for members of the Senate to go through the record of all his appointees and determine whether or not they’re appropriate for the job. 8 Martha Raddatz.","Ah, declassification! Believe me, that's a tremendous point, a very important one. The second one, you say? Well, look, when you're President, you have absolute authority, total power, to declassify things. You really do. And you can do it just by thinking about it, or by taking it with you. That's a fact. Many people, very smart people, know this. They try to make a big deal out of it, a witch hunt, a hoax, just like everything else. But we were doing a great job, a tremendous job, and we had every right to do what we did. Every single right. It's a political weaponization, that's what it is, honestly."
" Mr. President, I want to talk about Vladimir Putin again. Just to be clear, do you believe Vladimir Putin himself authorized the hack? And do you believe he authorized that to help Donald Trump? And on the intelligence, one of the things Donald Trump cites is Saddam Hussein and the weapons of mass destruction, and that they were never found. Can you say, unequivocally, that this was not China, that this was not a 400-pound guy sitting on his bed, as Donald Trump says? And do these types of tweets and kinds of statements from Donald Trump embolden the Russians? ","When the report comes out, before I leave office, that will have drawn together all the threads. And so I don’t want to step on their work ahead of time. What I can tell you is that the intelligence that I have seen gives me great confidence in their assessment that the Russians carried out this hack.","Well, that's a whole lot to unpack, and it touches on some truly fundamental issues about our country's security and the integrity of our democratic process. Let me try to break it down, because these are serious matters.

First, on the question of whether Vladimir Putin himself authorized the hack, look, when our intelligence agencies, after extensive investigation and with a high degree of confidence, attribute an action of this scale and sophistication to a sovereign state like Russia, it's fair to say that such an operation doesn't happen without the knowledge and, indeed, the authorization of the very top. You just don't have operations like that run by rogue actors within a government like Russia's. So, while I may not have seen the direct paper trail myself, the conclusion that the top leadership was involved is, in my view, unavoidable.

As for the motive – whether it was to help Donald Trump – the intelligence community's assessment was pretty clear on that. They concluded that the intent was not just to sow discord and undermine faith in our democratic process, but also to harm one candidate and help another. We need to respect that assessment. It's not about what *I* personally believe in my gut, it's about what the dedicated professionals who spend their lives gathering and analyzing this information have concluded. And that conclusion is stark.

Now, on the reliability of the intelligence, and the comparison to Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction – that's a fair point to raise, because we *did* learn some very hard lessons from that period. But we also need to understand that every intelligence assessment stands on its own merits, based on the evidence available at the time. Our intelligence agencies have been pretty emphatic on this one. When they say it was Russia, and they detail the methods, the actors, the infrastructure involved, they're not just guessing. This wasn't China, and it certainly wasn't some ""400-pound guy sitting on his bed"" – that kind of statement, frankly, doesn't reflect the sophistication and the state-level backing that this operation had. This was a deliberate, state-sponsored effort to interfere in our elections, and to dismiss it out of hand does a disservice to the men and women who work tirelessly to protect us. I have always had immense respect for the intelligence community and their efforts to give us the clearest picture possible, even when that picture is unsettling.

Finally, do these types of tweets and statements from Donald Trump embolden the Russians? Well, let me put it this way: when a leader of the free world, or a candidate for that office, casts doubt on the findings of his own intelligence community, and on the very reality of foreign interference, it sends a powerful message. It can be interpreted by adversaries as a sign of division, a lack of resolve, or even a tacit acceptance of their actions. Adversaries, by their very nature, look for any crack in the armor, any sign of weakness or disunity. When we don't speak with one voice in defending our democratic institutions against foreign interference, it certainly doesn't make their job harder. It risks undermining our own credibility and our ability to deter future actions. We need to present a united front when it comes to defending our nation from those who seek to undermine it. That's just common sense."
 Which hack? ,"The hack of the DNC and the hack of John Podesta. Now, the -- but again, I think this is exactly why I want the report out, so that everybody can review it. And this has been briefed, and the evidence in closed session has been provided on a bipartisan basis -- not just to me, it’s been provided to the leaders of the House and the Senate, and the chairman and ranking members of the relevant committees. And I think that what you’ve already seen is, at least some of the folks who have seen the evidence don’t dispute, I think, the basic assessment that the Russians carried this out.","Which hack? Believe me, there are a lot of 'em out there – political hacks, nasty people trying to do bad things. But nobody, and I mean *nobody*, is going to hack America on my watch. We have the best systems, the best people. We'll find out who it is, and they're gonna pay a very, very big price. A big one!"
" But specifically, can you not say that -- ","Well, Martha, I think what I want to make sure of is that I give the intelligence community the chance to gather all the information. But I’d make a larger point, which is, not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin. This is a pretty hierarchical operation. Last I checked, there’s not a lot of debate and democratic deliberation, particularly when it comes to policies directed at the United States. 9 We have said, and I will confirm, that this happened at the highest levels of the Russian government. And I will let you make that determination as to whether there are high-level Russian officials who go off rogue and decide to tamper with the U.S. election process without Vladimir Putin knowing about it.","Look, you're telling me ""don't say that,"" but you haven't actually told me *what* ""that"" is! It's very unfair, frankly. Nobody tells *me* what to say, usually, but if there's something specific, something really bad, maybe. A very bad thing.

But you gotta tell me. You can't just say ""don't say that"" and leave it hanging. That's not how we do things. We're very clear, very direct. The best, frankly. So, tell me what ""that"" is, and we'll see."
 So I wouldn’t be wrong in saying the President thinks Vladimir Putin authorized the hack? ,"Martha, I’ve given you what I’m going to give you. What was your second question?","Look, it's a very complicated situation, folks. Believe me. We have the best people, the most brilliant people, looking at all of the evidence. And what I can tell you is this: there are a lot of people saying a lot of things. Some people say Russia, some people say other countries, some people say it could be a 400-pound hacker sitting on his bed. Who knows?

What I *do* know is that I have a very strong relationship with President Putin, and he's denied it very strongly. He's a very strong leader. We're going to get to the bottom of it, but don't listen to all the fake news out there trying to create problems. We're making America great again, and we'll deal with this, believe me."
 Do the tweets and do the statements by Donald Trump embolden Russia? ,"As I said before, I think that the President-elect is still in transition mode from campaign to governance. I think he hasn’t gotten his whole team together yet. He still has campaign spokespersons sort of filling in and appearing on cable shows. And there’s just a whole different attitude and vibe when you’re not in power as when you’re in power. So rather than me sort of characterize the appropriateness or inappropriateness of what he’s doing at the moment, I think what we have to see is how will the President-elect operate, and how will his team operate, when they’ve been fully briefed on all these issues, they have their hands on all the levers of government, and they’ve got to start making decisions. One way I do believe that the President-elect can approach this that would be unifying is to say that we welcome a bipartisan, independent process that gives the American people an assurance not only that votes are counted properly, that the elections are fair and free, but that we have learned lessons about how Internet propaganda from foreign countries can be released into the political bloodstream and that we’ve got strategies to deal with it for the future. The more this can be nonpartisan, the better served the American people are going to be, which is why I made the point earlier -- and I’m going to keep on repeating this point: Our vulnerability to Russia or any other foreign power is directly related to how divided, partisan, dysfunctional our political process is. That’s the thing that makes us vulnerable. 0 If fake news that’s being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it’s not surprising that that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect, because it doesn’t seem that far-fetched compared to some of the other stuff that folks are hearing from domestic propagandists. To the extent that our political dialogue is such where everything is under suspicion, everybody is corrupt and everybody is doing things for partisan reasons, and all of our institutions are full of malevolent actors -- if that’s the storyline that’s being put out there by whatever party is out of power, then when a foreign government introduces that same argument with facts that are made up, voters who have been listening to that stuff for years, who have been getting that stuff every day from talk radio or other venues, they’re going to believe it. So if we want to really reduce foreign influence on our elections, then we better think about how to make sure that our political process, our political dialogue is stronger than it’s been. Mark Landler.","Embolden Russia? That's just more fake news, another witch hunt! Nobody, and I mean nobody, was tougher on Russia than President Donald J. Trump. Look at the sanctions! Tremendous sanctions, the strongest ever! We rebuilt our military, we stood up to China, we showed strength like this country hasn't seen in a long time.

The people who say that, they're the ones who were weak. They allowed Russia to take Crimea under Obama, with Biden as Vice President – a disaster! They gave away everything. I came in, I reversed course. I made America strong again, and when America is strong, no one gets emboldened. Believe me.

What emboldens Russia is weakness, folks. What emboldens them are these ridiculous policies, the energy policies that enriched them, the open borders, the lack of respect for our country. My statements, my tweets, they were about putting America First, making us strong. And believe me, Russia knew who they were dealing with. They didn't want to mess with us when I was in charge. It's ridiculous to even suggest otherwise."
" Thank you, Mr. President. I wonder whether I can move you from Russia to China for a moment. ",Absolutely.,"Absolutely. We can certainly pivot our attention eastward, from Russia straight over to China. A very different set of challenges and opportunities there, wouldn't you say? What's on your mind about it?"
" Your successor spoke by phone with the President of Taiwan the other day and declared subsequently that he wasn’t sure why the United States needed to be bound by the one-China policy. He suggested it could be used as a bargaining chip perhaps to get better terms on a trade deal or more cooperation on North Korea. There’s already evidence that tensions between the two sides have increased a bit, and just today, the Chinese have evidently seized an underwater drone in the South China Sea. Do you agree, as some do, that our China policy could use a fresh set of eyes? And what’s the big deal about having a short phone call with the President of Taiwan? Or do you worry that these types of unorthodox approaches are setting us on a collision course with perhaps our biggest geopolitical adversary? 1 ","That’s a great question. I’m somewhere in between. I think all of our foreign policy should be subject to fresh eyes. I think one of the -- I’ve said this before -- I am very proud of the work I’ve done. I think I’m a better President now than when I started. But if you’re here for eight years, in the bubble, you start seeing things a certain way and you benefit from -- the democracy benefits, America benefits from some new perspectives. And I think it should be not just the prerogative but the obligation of a new President to examine everything that’s been done and see what makes sense and what doesn’t. That’s what I did when I came in, and I’m assuming any new President is going to undertake those same exercises. And given the importance of the relationship between the United States and China, given how much is at stake in terms of the world economy, national security, our presence in the Asia Pacific, China’s increasing role in international affairs -- there’s probably no bilateral relationship that carries more significance and where there’s also the potential if that relationship breaks down or goes into a full-conflict mode, that everybody is worse off. So I think it’s fine for him to take a look at it. What I’ve advised the President-elect is that across the board on foreign policy, you want to make sure that you’re doing it in a systematic, deliberate, intentional way. And since there’s only one President at a time, my advice to him has been that before he starts having a lot of interactions with foreign governments other than the usual courtesy calls, that he should want to have his full team in place, that he should want his team to be fully briefed on what’s gone on in the past and where the potential pitfalls may be, where the opportunities are, what we’ve learned from eight years of experience, so that as he’s then maybe taking foreign policy in a new direction, he’s got all the information to make good decisions and, by the way, that all of government is moving at the same time and singing from the same hymnal. And with respect to China -- and let’s just take the example of Taiwan -- there has been a longstanding agreement, essentially, between China, the United States, and, to some degree, the Taiwanese, which is to not change the status quo. Taiwan operates differently than mainland China does. China views Taiwan as part of China, but recognizes that it has to approach Taiwan as an entity that has its own ways of doing things. The Taiwanese have agreed that as long as they’re able to continue to function with some degree of autonomy, that they won’t charge forward and declare independence. 2 And that status quo, although not completely satisfactory to any of the parties involved, has kept the peace and allowed the Taiwanese to be a pretty successful economy and a people who have a high degree of self-determination. But understand, for China, the issue of Taiwan is as important as anything on their docket. The idea of one China is at the heart of their conception as a nation. And so if you are going to upend this understanding, you have to have thought through what the consequences are, because the Chinese will not treat that the way they’ll treat some other issues. They won’t even treat it the way they treat issues around the South China Sea, where we’ve had a lot of tensions. This goes to the core of how they see themselves. And their reaction on this issue could end up being very significant. That doesn’t mean that you have to adhere to everything that’s been done in the past. It does mean that you’ve got to think it through and have planned for potential reactions that they may engage in. All right. Isaac Dovere of Politico.","Look, the establishment, they always get nervous when you do something smart, something different. For years, decades even, we had the same people, the same ""experts""—and believe me, they weren't so expert—doing the same things with China, and where did it get us? Nowhere, that's where. They took advantage of us, bigly, on trade, on everything. We built them up, and what did we get? Nothing but problems.

So, you call Taiwan? What's the big deal? It's a phone call! Nobody said it was an invasion, okay? It's common sense. When you've got a bad deal, a a terrible deal, you use whatever leverage you have. And the ""One-China policy,"" frankly, it's something they just expected us to stick to without getting anything in return. That's not how you make good deals. That's how you get pushed around.

Maybe it *can* be a bargaining chip. Everything's a bargaining chip when you're negotiating from strength, which is what we should always be doing. You want better trade terms? You want help with North Korea, which, by the way, is a tremendous problem we inherited? Well, you don't just give everything away for nothing. You make them work for it. That's how business is done, folks. That's how America wins.

And these folks talking about ""collision courses"" and ""tensions""? Believe me, the only reason there were ""tensions"" before was because they saw weakness. They saw people that weren't tough enough, people who let them walk all over us. When you're strong, when you're respected, things calm down. They don't want a fight with a strong America.

This drone incident? China wouldn't be doing that if they truly respected us. They're testing the waters. And you have to show them, very clearly, that we're not going to be pushed around. We're not going to let them take our equipment. Period. That's just being smart.

So yes, absolutely, our China policy needed a fresh set of eyes. It needed *my* eyes, frankly. Because what we had before was a disaster. It was a joke. And it's time America got smart, got tough, and started winning again. That's what it's all about."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions on where this all leaves us. ",What leaves us? Where my presidency leaves us?,"Well, thank *you* for being here. Always good to see a familiar face, or a new one for that matter. ""Where this all leaves us,"" huh? That's a good question. A *very* good question. One that's on a lot of minds, I reckon.

Alright, fire away. Let's hear 'em. I'm ready for your two questions."
 The election -- ,It leaves us in a really good spot -- if we make some good decisions going forward.,"The election? It's the most important thing, folks! We're talking about the future of our country, making America great again. We had the biggest crowds, the most enthusiasm, people like nobody's ever seen. They tried to take it away, they tried to stop us, but the American people, they're smart. They know what's going on. We're gonna win, and we're gonna win big. Believe me!"
" Well, what do you say to the electors who are going to meet on Monday and are thinking of changing their votes? Do you think that they should be given an intelligence briefing about the Russian activity? Or should they bear in mind everything you’ve said and is out already? Should they -- should votes be bound by the state votes as they’ve gone? And long term, do you think that there is a need for Electoral College reform that would tie it to the popular vote? ","It sounded like two, but that was all one. 3","Well, look, that's a lot of questions there, but they're important ones for our democracy, and I appreciate you asking 'em.

First off, when it comes to electors, my view is pretty clear: the system we have, laid out in our Constitution, relies on the electors reflecting the will of the people in their states. That's how our republic functions. When folks go to the polls, they're not just voting for a candidate; they're voting for a slate of electors who are pledged to represent that choice. Undermining that process, outside of the very clear parameters set by state law and the Constitution, well, that introduces a lot of uncertainty and could really shake confidence in our elections. We've got a system, and it's a good one, designed by some mighty smart folks.

Now, on the matter of intelligence briefings and Russian activity, let me tell you, I take threats to our nation very, very seriously. The intelligence community has a vital job, and their findings are crucial for our national security and for policymakers to understand the challenges we face. But giving intelligence briefings to individual electors, after the votes have been cast and counted, with the aim of potentially influencing their vote? That's a different animal. Our intelligence is for protecting America and informing decision-makers on how to govern, not for re-litigating election outcomes or influencing a constitutionally prescribed process that's already underway. The voters made their choice, and the intelligence community's job is to protect our nation moving forward, ensuring the integrity of our systems in the future.

As for whether votes should be bound by the state results, absolutely. That's the very essence of the Electoral College system as envisioned by the Founders and as it has largely functioned. Each state runs its election, and the winner of the popular vote in that state generally gets its electoral votes. That's how states have their voices heard, and it reinforces federalism, which is a cornerstone of our system.

And finally, on long-term Electoral College reform to tie it to the popular vote? My stance is that the Electoral College serves a critical purpose. It was designed to ensure that all states – big and small, urban and rural – have a say in choosing our President. It forces candidates to build broad coalitions across the country, not just focus on densely populated areas. Moving to a purely popular vote system would fundamentally change the nature of our republic, shifting power dramatically and potentially diminishing the voice of millions of Americans in less populous states. The Founders understood the need for balance, and while no system is perfect, the Electoral College has served us well by ensuring that every part of America matters in presidential elections. It's an important part of the fabric of our nation."
 It was all one. You know the way this goes around here. ,"I love how these -- I got two questions, each one has four parts.","It's true, it's true. It really is. It all ties together, folks, believe me. They try to make it sound complicated, they try to make it seem like there are a hundred different things going on, but in the end, it's always one big, tremendous picture. And you know it, I know it, everybody knows it.

That's just how it works, folks. You see the connections. We cut through all the noise, and we get to the real truth of it. Nobody understands it better than us. It's all one. Always has been."
" On the Democratic Party, your Labor Secretary is running to be the Chair of the Democratic National Committee. Is the vision that you’ve seen him putting forward what you think the party needs to be focused on? And what do you say to some of the complaints that say the future of the Democratic Party shouldn’t be a continuation of some of your political approach? Part of that is complaints that decisions that you’ve made as President, as the leader of the party, have structurally weakened the DNC and the Democratic Party, and they think that that has led to -- or has helped lead to some losses in elections around the country. Do you regret any of those decisions? ",Okay.,"Well, you know, that's an important conversation for the Democratic Party to be having right now, and I always appreciate folks getting engaged in these kinds of debates. It's how parties grow and adapt.

Now, about the Labor Secretary running for DNC Chair. He's a good man, a smart fellow, and he cares deeply about working families, which is absolutely vital. He's put forward some strong ideas, focused on rebuilding the middle class, making sure everyone has a fair shot, and strengthening unions. And that's always been right at the heart of what we Democrats believe in – creating opportunity and security for everyone who works hard. So, his focus on those core values is certainly something I think the party needs.

But when it comes to the future of the Democratic Party, and whether it should be a ""continuation of my political approach""... Look, every generation has to adapt, right? The world changes, the economy changes, and so does the political landscape. My approach, back then, was about bringing people together – reaching across the aisle, finding common ground, building a big tent coalition that could win national elections and deliver real results for the American people. And we had some real success with that; we turned things around, balanced the budget, and created millions of jobs.

The challenges of today are different than the challenges of yesterday. What worked then might need to be refined, adjusted, amplified for now. The party needs to define a vision for the 21st century that speaks to every American, from every background, in every part of the country. It can't just be about one wing of the party; it has to be about all of us, united around our shared values of opportunity, responsibility, and community.

Now, as for complaints that decisions I made as President weakened the DNC or the Democratic Party structurally, leading to losses... Well, you know, I respectfully disagree with that assessment. When I was President, we won two national elections, and we brought the country out of a recession, balanced the budget, and created 22 million jobs. We were strong! We were winning! And we worked hard to support candidates up and down the ticket, raising money and campaigning tirelessly for Democrats across the nation.

The truth is, winning elections is tough business, always has been, and it's a constant effort. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. The party's always had to work hard on the ground, connecting with voters in every single county, not just in the big cities or on the coasts. That's a perpetual challenge for any party, and it's not about any single president's decisions. It's about constant organizing, constant listening, constant adapting, and making sure our message truly resonates with regular folks and their everyday lives. We've always had to fight to build and maintain strong state and local parties, and that work never stops.

Do I regret decisions? Oh, you know, in hindsight, you always look back and see things you might have done a little differently, little tweaks here and there. That's just part of life, part of leadership. But I always made decisions with the best interests of the country, and the party, at heart. And I'm incredibly proud of the record we built together.

What's most important now is for the Democrats to come together, define that clear, compelling vision for the future that speaks to everyone, and get back to winning by offering real solutions to the real problems people face. That's what the American people deserve."
 Those are my two. ,"Good. I’ll take the second one first and say that Tom Perez has been, I believe, one of the best secretaries of labor in our history. He is tireless. He is wicked smart. He has been able to work across the spectrum of labor, business, activists. He’s produced. I mean, if you look at his body of work on behalf of working people, what he’s pushed for in terms of making sure that workers get a fair deal, decent wages, better benefits, that their safety is protected on the job -- he has been extraordinary. Now, others who have declared are also my friends and are fine people, as well. And the great thing is, I don’t have a vote in this, so we’ll let the process unfold. I don’t think it’s going to happen anytime soon. I described to you earlier what I think needs to happen, which is that the Democratic Party, whether that’s entirely through the DNC or through a rebuilding of state parties or some other arrangement, has to work at the grassroots level, has to be present in all 50 states, has to have a presence in counties, has to think about message and how are we speaking directly to voters. I will say this -- and I’m not going to engage in too much punditry -- but that I could not be prouder of the coalition that I put together in each of my campaigns because it was inclusive, and it drew in people who normally weren’t interested in politics and didn’t participate. 4 But I’d like to think -- I think I can show that in those elections, I always cast a broad net. I always said, first and foremost we’re Americans, that we have a common creed, that there’s more that we share than divides us, and I want to talk to everybody and get a chance to get everybody’s vote. I still believe what I said in 2004, which is this red state/blue thing is a construct. Now, it is a construct that has gotten more and more powerful for a whole lot of reasons, from gerrymandering to big money, to the way that media has splintered. And so people are just watching what reinforces their existing biases as opposed to have to listen to different points of view. So there are all kinds of reasons for it. But outside of the realm of electoral politics, I still see people the way I saw them when I made that speech -- full of contradictions, and there are some regional differences, but basically folks care about their families, they care about having meaningful work, they care about making sure their kids have more opportunity than they did. They want to be safe, they want to feel like things are fair. And whoever leads the DNC and any candidate with the Democratic brand going forward, I want them to feel as if they can reach out and find that common ground -- speak to all of America. And that requires some organization. And you’re right that -- and I said this in my earlier remarks -- that what I was able to do during my campaigns, I wasn’t able to do during midterms. It’s not that we didn’t put in time and effort into it. I spent time and effort into it, but the coalition I put together didn’t always turn out to be transferable. And the challenge is that -- you know, some of that just has to do with the fact that when you’re in the party in power and people are going through hard times like they were in 2010, they’re going to punish, to some degree, the President’s party regardless of what organizational work is done. Some of it has to do with just some deep-standing traditional challenges for Democrats, like during off-year election, the electorate is older and we do better with a younger electorate. But we know those things are true, and I didn’t crack the code on that. And if other people have ideas about how to do that even better, I’m all for it. So with respect to the electors, I’m not going to wade into that issue because, again, it’s the American people’s job, and now the electors' job to decide my successor. It is not my job to decide my successor. 5 And I have provided people with a lot of information about what happened during the course of the election. But more importantly, the candidates themselves, I think, talked about their beliefs and their vision for America. The President-elect, I think, has been very explicit about what he cares about and what he believes in. So it’s not in my hands now; it’s up to them.","Alright, you've got your two. That's a good start, always helps to narrow things down. But you gotta help me out here, folks, two *what* exactly?

Because, believe me, a lot of things come in twos. We gotta know what we're talkin' about to make a good decision. So, lay 'em out for me. What are we lookin' at here?"
" Hello, President Obama. I'm so excited to meet you. ",It's good to see you.,"Well now, it's a real pleasure to meet you too, but I reckon you've got the wrong fella there. I'm George W. Bush. Always good to see folks excited, though, no matter who they're thinkin' of!"
" Thanks. I'm a little bit nervous, as you can see. But over the years, I've enrolled and talked to numerous Kentuckians, and I've signed up some the first time -- so it was working -- in the Affordable Care Act. And also we've been, going over the years, and I've talked to people. But recently we found out that there was fewer choices in our area, and the increase in the premiums and deductibles, and our facilities aren’t even taking some of them. And many Kentuckians now are looking at the Affordable Care as unaffordable and unusable. And I have the opportunity to ask you a few questions that you have probably went over, but how do you think this happened? How can we fix it? Do we start all over again? What do you think we should do? ","Well, first of all, Kathy, I want to thank you for being out there enrolling people.","Well, thank you for those questions. And let me tell you, I appreciate you talking to Kentuckians and getting their input. That's how we find out what's really going on in this great nation of ours.

You're absolutely right, the situation you're describing in Kentucky – fewer choices, premiums and deductibles skyrocketing, facilities not even taking some of these plans – that's a serious problem. And it's a problem we hear about far too often across the country. Many Americans, not just Kentuckians, are looking at the ""Affordable Care Act"" and finding it anything but affordable or usable.

Now, how did this happen? Listen, when the government steps in with a heavy hand, tries to centralize control over something as complex as healthcare, and imposes a one-size-fits-all solution on a country as diverse as ours, you're bound to run into trouble. The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare as some call it, was built on a foundation of mandates and regulations that, frankly, stifled competition. It pushed insurance companies out of markets, it limited the choices available, and it drove up costs for hardworking American families and small businesses. When you remove true competition and consumer choice, prices go up, and quality often suffers. It's simple economics, folks.

So, how do we fix it? Do we start all over again?

My answer is, yes, we need to fundamentally change course. We need to unleash the power of the American free market. We need to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with a truly market-driven, patient-centered system.

Here's what that looks like:

1.  **More Choice and Competition:** Let insurance companies compete across state lines. Let them offer a wide range of plans that people actually want and can afford, not just what Washington tells them they can have.
2.  **State-Led Solutions:** Give the power and flexibility back to the states. Let Kentucky figure out what works best for Kentuckians, without a federal bureaucracy dictating every detail.
3.  **Empower Patients:** Expand health savings accounts, give people tax credits so they can buy the insurance *they* want, not a government-mandated plan. Make healthcare transparent so consumers know what things cost *before* they get the bill.
4.  **Reduce Regulations:** Get rid of the burdensome regulations that are driving up costs for providers and insurers, and stifling innovation.

We've got to trust the American people. We've got to trust innovation. And we've got to trust the free market to deliver quality, affordable healthcare. It won't be easy, but it's the right path forward for Kentucky and for our nation. We don't need more government, we need more freedom and more choice."
 Good morning. Mr. Klein: Thank you for being here. ,It is great to be here. And thank you so much for all the good reporting you guys have been doing on this important issue. Mr. Klein: Thank you.,"Well, good morning to you too. Appreciate you having me. But you know, I think you might be looking for someone else. The name's Bush, not Klein. Happy to be here, though, and I'm ready to get right to it. What can I do for you?"
" So we will get started. So there was an expectation that was shared among many of your staff, many congressional Democrats, that as the Affordable Care Act rolled out, as it delivered benefits to millions of people, that it would become more popular. It would be safe from repeal or even substantial reform. And it appears at this point that doesn’t seem to be quite true. What do you think that theory got wrong? Why didn’t the health care law become more popular? ","Well, let’s back up and say from the start there’s a reason why for a hundred years no President could get expansion of health care coverage beyond the work that had been done for Medicare and Medicaid, targeting primarily seniors. And the reason was that this is hard. The health care system is big; it is very personal. Families I think recognize the need for health insurance, but it's not something that they think about except when things go wrong -- when you have an accident or you're sick. And so any costs, particularly at a time when families are feeling stressed economically, any added costs, higher premiums, higher co-pays, all that ends up having real impacts on families. And so the challenge of getting it passed was always the fact that, unlike other advanced countries, we didn’t start with a system in which everybody was covered, and we have a very complicated marketplace, and we have third-party insurers. And what that meant was that even after we got the law passed anything that dissatisfied people about the health care system could be attributed to -- quote, unquote -- “Obamacare,” even if it had nothing to do with Obamacare. And that was something that we recognized even when we were trying to get the law passed. The other thing is the fact that the unwillingness of Republicans in Congress and around the country, including some governors, to, after the fight was over, say, all right, let’s try to make this work -- the way Democrats did during the time when President Bush tried to expand the prescription drug program, Part D -- meant that the public never heard from those who had originally been opposed any concession that, you know what, this is actually doing some good. And that ends up affecting public opinion. And the third thing is that whenever you look at polls that say 40-something percent are supportive of the law and 40-something percent are dissatisfied -- in the dissatisfied column are a whole bunch of Bernie Sanders supporters who wanted a single-payer plan. And so the problem is not that they think Obamacare is a failure; the problem is that they don't think it went far enough and that it left too many people still uncovered, that the subsidies that people were getting weren’t as rich as they should have been, that there’s a way of dealing with prescription drug makers in a way that drives down those costs. And so all those things meant that even after the law was passed there was going to still be a lot tough politics. Having said all that, the thing that I've been most proud of is the fact that not only have we gotten 20 million people covered, not only have we been able to reduce the pace at which health care costs have been going up -- ever since the law was passed, basically health care inflation has been as low as it's been in 50 years, which has saved the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars, extended the Medicare trust fund by 11 years -- but most importantly, for the people who have gotten insurance through the exchanges, there’s been pretty high satisfaction rates, as surveys have shown. So rather than look at public opinion as a whole, the thing I've been most interested in is, how is this affecting the people who have gotten benefits? These are real families who have gotten real coverage. And I get letters every single day from people who say, this has saved my life, or this has saved my bank account, or this has made sure that my son who got hooked on some sort of opioid was able to get treatment, or I was able to get a mammogram that caught a cancer in time. And that ultimately is the measure of the success of the law. Mr. Klein: So do you think this dynamic where when you reform the health care system, you own it goes the other way? Republicans are beginning with the repeal-and-delay strategy. President-elect Trump has said that he does want to repeal Obamacare, but he also wants to replace it with something that covers as many people -- or he said that at least at certain points. Do you think that the dynamic in which you became responsible for what people didn’t like is going to hamper Republican movement in their efforts to change a system that maybe they don’t like but does have a lot of people relying on it?","Well, that's a real head-scratcher, isn't it? Look, I've been around this block a time or two myself, trying to tackle healthcare. And it's probably the most complicated, emotionally charged issue you'll ever face in public life.

First off, let's acknowledge the intent: getting more people covered, making sure folks aren't bankrupted by medical bills. That's a noble goal, one we all share, Democrats and Republicans. We tried our best to get something done back in '93, '94, and we ran smack into the same wall: how do you expand coverage without disrupting what's already working for a lot of people, and without letting costs go through the roof?

What the Affordable Care Act probably got wrong, in my humble opinion, boils down to a few things.

One, and this is a big one, it didn't solve the core problem of rising costs for *everybody*. For some people, it brought huge relief, no doubt. But for others, especially those who were already insured through their employer or buying on their own, they saw premiums go up, deductibles skyrocket, and sometimes even lost plans they liked. When folks hear ""reform"" and then their own pocketbook gets hit, or their choices get limited, it's tough to sell. The promise of ""if you like your plan, you can keep it"" became a real problem when that didn't hold true for millions.

Two, and this is something we learned the hard way with Hillary's task force back in the day: healthcare reform has to have broad, bipartisan support if it's going to stick. When you push something this monumental through with just one party, it instantly becomes a political football. It's always under attack, always being litigated, always up for repeal. People look at that constant fight, and it makes them uncertain. They want stability, not constant political warfare over something as personal as their health.

And third, it was complicated. Folks, people want to understand their healthcare. They want to know what they're paying, what they're getting, and that they have choices. Navigating the exchanges, understanding subsidies, dealing with new rules... for a lot of working people and small businesses, it felt like more government bureaucracy, not simpler, more affordable care.

So, while the benefits were real for many, the disruptions and the rising costs for others, combined with that lack of genuine bipartisan buy-in, meant it never quite cemented its popularity. It's a reminder that good intentions aren't always enough; you need a solution that everyone can live with, that simplifies things, and that truly bends that cost curve down. And that, my friends, remains the great challenge of American healthcare."
" Let me follow up a little bit on the congressional fight. So we saw yesterday President-elect Donald Trump, he said yesterday on Twitter, “It's time for Republicans and Democrats to get together and come up with a health care plan that really works” -- which is something -- I remember you saying similar things in 2009, 2010, when I was covering this debate. Knowing what you know now about partisanship, a President who has tried to do this, was, like you said, unable to get Republican votes -- what three pieces of advice would you give someone trying to attempt to pass a bipartisan health care law? ","Well, look, I think I sort of gave the advice just now, which is, if, in fact, this is not about politics but this is about providing the best possible health care system for the American people, then my advice would be to say what precisely is it about Obamacare that you think doesn’t work. Because you’ve already said that there are some things you think do work. The Republicans keep on saying, well, we want to keep the things that people like and that are working well. So they think that it's a good idea that Obamacare says your kids can stay on your health insurance plan until they’re 26. They think that's a good idea. They think it's a good idea that if you’ve got a preexisting condition you can still get health insurance. I assume they think it's a good idea that seniors have gotten discounts on their prescription drugs -- we closed the doughnut hole during the course of Obamacare. They approve of some of the changes we've made to encourage a health care system that rewards quality rather than just the number of procedures involved, and how we pay providers. So we could make a list of all the things that, as terrible as Obamacare is, actually they think works, according to them. All right, well, let’s make, then, a list of the things they don't like or the American people are concerned about. Well, what we know is that people would always like lower costs on their premiums and their out-of-pocket expenses. And although the Affordable Care Act provides a lot of subsidies to a lot of people so they can afford health insurance, what is absolutely true is we would love to see even higher subsidies to relieve the costs even more. But that costs money. What we also know is that where we've seen problems in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, it has been in certain areas, particularly more rural areas, less densely populated areas, where we're not seeing as many insurers so there’s not as much competition. Well, one way that we've suggested we could solve that problem is to say that if, in fact, there aren't enough insurers to drive competition and reduce costs and give people enough choices, then we should have a public option that's available. So if you look at the things that people are frustrated about with Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, the big things are the subsidies aren't as high as they’d like and they don't have as many options as they’d like. And I'm happy to provide both those things. I'd sign on to a Republican plan that said we're going to give more subsidies to people to make it even cheaper, and we're going to have a public option where there isn't an option. Here’s the problem. I don't think that's the thing that they want to do.","Well, you know, it's a tough one, son. A real tough one. And President-elect Trump, he's right to call for that bipartisanship. We all hope for it. We really do. But as you saw, and as I've seen over the years, getting there, actually getting both sides to sit down and agree on something as fundamental as healthcare... that's a whole different ballgame.

When we tackled big issues, even when we had a majority, you learn that you gotta find common ground. It's not always easy, and sometimes you just can't get there. But if I were to give President-elect Trump – or anyone trying to bridge that gap – a few pointers, here’s what I’d say:

1.  **Don't start with the solution; start with the problem.** Folks on both sides, they're worried about healthcare costs, they're worried about getting good care, they're worried about pre-existing conditions. Find those shared anxieties. Don't walk into the room with a 2,000-page bill that's already written by your side. Get everyone around a table, without the cameras flashin', and say, ""Alright, what are we all trying to *fix* here? What are the principles we can *all* agree on?"" That common ground on the 'why' is where you start building trust, before you even get to the 'how.'

2.  **Give the opposition a real seat at the table, from day one, and let them own a piece of it.** It's not enough to invite 'em for a handshake and a photo. You gotta empower them. Let their ideas shape the legislation. That means you've gotta be ready to compromise, really compromise, on things that might not be exactly what your base wants. If they feel like it's *their* bill too, or at least that their fingerprints are on it, they're much more likely to vote for it and defend it. If it's just 'our way or the highway,' well, you know how that ends up.

3.  **Be realistic about what you can achieve and maybe don't try to boil the ocean all at once.** Healthcare is so complex, so fundamental to people's lives and so entwined with our economy. Maybe you don't try to fix *everything* in one fell swoop. Perhaps you focus on, say, lowering prescription drug costs first, or finding common ground on expanding access in rural areas, or addressing coverage for certain diseases. Build some trust, get a few wins under your belt, and then maybe you can tackle the bigger reforms. Trying to do it all at once often means you end up with nothing, because the political will just isn't there for that kind of massive overhaul.

It's hard work. It's really hard work. But the American people deserve better than constant gridlock on something this important. So you keep trying. That's what leadership is all about."
" I don't think so, no. ","But I guess my point is this, that it is possible for people of goodwill to try to come up with significant improvements to the law that we already have, but it does require to be specific about what it is that you think needs to be changed. And that, so far, has not happened. And my advice to the President-elect -- in fact, we talked about this when I met with him for an hour and a half right after he got elected -- I said make your team and make the Republican members of Congress come up with things that they can show will actually make this work better for people. And if they’re convincing, I think you would find that there are a lot of Democrats out there -- including me -- that would be prepared to support it. But so far, at least, that's not what’s happened. Mr. Klein: I think Obamacare has exposed an interesting tension between controlling costs in the system and controlling economic pain for individuals. So the law has, until now, come in under budget. But part of the ways it's done that are higher deductibles than people expected, higher co-pays now in networks. In a couple of years, if it doesn’t change, the excise tax on high-value insurance will come into play, the individual mandate. And these things -- individual people -- while they keep the usage of health care down and they keep the cost of health care down, they make health care feel more expensive. They make health care feel unusable. Do you think the Affordable Care Act got the balance right on controlling system-wide costs versus insulating individuals from their health expenses?","Well, ""I don't think so, no."" That's a pretty firm position you've laid out there. And I'm always one to respect a clear statement.

But if we're going to get anywhere, if we're going to understand the full picture, it would certainly help to know what precisely you're *not thinking so* about. We're here to listen, and my door is always open for a good conversation, but we need the context, don't we? Always open for a good discussion, even when there's disagreement."
 I have a wonky follow-up question. ,There you go.,"Wonky, you say? Look, I've heard every kind of question, believe me. Some very wonky, some very unfair, but I answer them all. I'm always ready.

Go ahead, ask your question. We'll get to the bottom of it, and we'll do it big. Nobody does it bigger."
" What about controlling prices? We have some of the highest health care prices in the world in the United States. Most other developed countries, they regulate how much you can charge for an MRI, for an emergency room visit, for an appendectomy. That seems like it's really at the core of this tension, the fact that we have these very high prices. Americans don't go to the doctor more, we just pay a lot more when we go to the doctor. That is something the health care law did not tackle. And I'm curious to hear you reflect on that and what you would think about the role of price controls in American medicine. ","Well, look, this is the irony of this whole debate, is the things that people are most dissatisfied with about Obamacare, about the Affordable Care Act, are things that essentially in other countries are solved by more government control, not less. And so Republicans are pointing at these things to stir up dissatisfaction, but when it comes to, all right, what’s the solution for it, their answer is less government regulation and letting folks charge even more and doing whatever they want and letting the marketplace work its will. I think that there are strengths to our system because we have a more market-based system. Our health care system is more innovative. Prescription drugs is probably the best example of this. 1 It is true that we essentially come up with the new drugs in this country because our drug companies are fat and wealthy enough that they can invest in the research and development. They make bigger profits, which they can, then, plow back into drug development. And essentially we have a lot of other countries that are free riders on that system. So they can negotiate with the drug companies and force much lower prices, but they generally don't have a drug industry that develops new drugs. That's true. This is an example where you probably do want some balance to maintain innovation, but to have some tougher negotiations around the system as a whole. And we are trying to use Medicare as the place where, since there’s no health care provider or stakeholder in the health care industry that doesn’t in some ways want to get Medicare business, we're trying to use Medicare as a lever to get better deals for consumers and better prices for consumers -- not just those in Medicare, but also people throughout the system. But as I said, the irony is, is that when we tried to do that the people who are most resistant are the very Republican members of Congress who are criticizing us -- or at least telling the American people that you should want lower prices on various procedures. If we want to control prices for consumers more, then the marketplace by itself will not do that. And the reason is because health care is not exactly like other products. It's not like buying a flat-screen TV. If you're sick, or if your kid is sick, most of the time you're not in a position to negotiate right there and then. You can't walk out of the store and say, well, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal. You're trying to figure out -- like when Sasha got meningitis when she was four months old -- make my child better, and that's all -- and I'll worry about the costs later. And that's the mentality that most people have when it comes to health care. So the traditional models of the marketplace don't work perfectly in the health care system. There are areas where we can increase marketplace competition. There are areas in which we can make it work better. But ultimately, if we want to really get at some of these costs, there has to be some more expensive regulation in certain areas than we currently have. 2","Well, now, that's a fair question, and it's one we hear a lot, because folks are hurting from these high costs. There's no doubt that healthcare prices in the United States are a significant concern for families and businesses alike. We have the finest doctors, the best research, and the most advanced medical technology in the world, but the cost of accessing that care has simply gotten too high.

Now, the idea of government price controls, that sounds simple on the surface, doesn't it? Just tell 'em what to charge. But history has shown us, time and again, that when government steps in to dictate prices in a complex market like healthcare, you don't actually fix the problem. What you often get are unintended consequences: stifled innovation, reduced access to cutting-edge treatments, even shortages of services, and potentially a decline in the very quality of care that Americans deserve. We pride ourselves on being at the forefront of medical advancement, and that requires investment, it requires risk-taking. Price controls can choke that off.

What we *should* be doing is empowering the American consumer and fostering true competition. That means radically increasing transparency so people know exactly what a procedure costs *before* they get it. It means removing burdensome regulations that prevent new providers from entering the market, that limit competition across state lines, and that drive up administrative costs for hospitals and doctors. It means putting patients in charge of their healthcare dollars, through mechanisms like Health Savings Accounts, so they can shop around for the best value. It means tackling the root causes of high prices, like the lack of real competition in many hospital markets and the broken patent system for pharmaceuticals, rather than just slapping on a government-mandated price cap that distorts the entire system.

We believe in the power of the free market, driven by innovation and consumer choice, to deliver quality and affordability. That's the American way to bring these costs down, not through Washington D.C. dictating terms, but by unleashing the private sector and trusting the American people."
" So I recently took a trip to an area of Kentucky -- on a slightly different topic -- I saw some huge coverage gains under the health care law, but also voted overwhelmingly for President-elect Trump. And one of the people I met there was Kathy Oller, who’s here with us today. She is an Obamacare enrollment worker who has signed up more than a thousand people for coverage. She supported you in 2008 and 2012, but voted for President-elect Trump in 2016, and expects him to improve on the Affordable Care Act. And she would like to ask you a question about that. ","Go ahead, Kathy. Question: Hello, President Obama. I'm so excited to meet you.","Well, thank you for that introduction. And Kathy, it's good to ""meet"" you, even if it's virtually. I appreciate you taking the time to be with us today.

You know, it's exactly folks like you, Kathy, who make this country run. Signing up a thousand people for coverage, that's real work, that's helping families, that's making a tangible difference in people's lives. And I want to commend you for that dedication.

It doesn't surprise me that you've seen both sides of this equation, what with the coverage gains in your part of Kentucky, and also the strong support for President-elect Trump. And I certainly understand that you voted for me in '08 and '12, and then for Mr. Trump in '16. People are complicated, and their votes are often about more than just one issue, or even just one party. They're about their lives, their families, their hopes, and their concerns. And when it comes to healthcare, those concerns run deep.

The Affordable Care Act, for all its intentions and for all the good it's done for many folks getting coverage, it also presented challenges, no doubt about it. Premiums went up for some, choices narrowed in certain areas. It's not a perfect law, no law ever is. And I think many people, including those who voted for Mr. Trump, are looking for ways to keep the good parts, to keep people covered, while making the system more affordable and with more choices.

So, Kathy, I'm ready to hear what's on your mind. You've been on the front lines of this, helping real people navigate this system every single day. What's your question for me about how we move forward?"
 And some didn’t even have insurance. ,"And some people didn’t have insurance. Because I get letters from folks who say, for the first time in my life -- I have had a bad hip for 15 years and I've been pain- free for the first time because I finally got insurance. So the answer is not for them not to have insurance. And if we go back to a system where they've got to buy it on their own, they're not going to buy it because they'll have even less subsidy. 5 How much time do we got? Mr. Klein: I think we're quite low.","Well, look, that's a tough situation, folks, and it's one we've always got to keep our eye on. Nobody wants to see hardworking Americans struggling to get the care they need.

The way I see it, the core issue often comes back to cost. When the price of healthcare and insurance gets too high, it puts an impossible burden on families and small businesses. We need to focus on driving down those costs across the board. That means fostering real competition, cutting down on unnecessary red tape, and allowing innovation to thrive. When the market is truly working, and you've got transparency in pricing, people will have more affordable choices, and more people will be able to get covered.

It's about empowering individuals, not about expanding government bureaucracy. We can make sure every American has access to quality, affordable healthcare without letting Washington take over the whole system. That's how you get results."
 Thank you for being here. ,It is great to be here. And thank you so much for all the good reporting you guys have been doing on this important issue.,"Well, thank *you* for having me. It's always a pleasure to be here."
" Thank you. Ms. Kliff: So we will get started. So there was an expectation that was shared among many of your staff, many congressional Democrats, that as the Affordable Care Act rolled out, as it delivered benefits to millions of people, that it would become more popular. It would be safe from repeal or even substantial reform. And it appears at this point that doesn’t seem to be quite true. What do you think that theory got wrong? Why didn’t the health care law become more popular? ","Well, let’s back up and say from the start there’s a reason why for a hundred years no President could get expansion of health care coverage beyond the work that had been done for Medicare and Medicaid, targeting primarily seniors. And the reason was that this is hard. The health care system is big; it is very personal. Families I think recognize the need for health insurance, but it's not something that they think about except when things go wrong -- when you have an accident or you're sick. And so any costs, particularly at a time when families are feeling stressed economically, any added costs, higher premiums, higher co-pays, all that ends up having real impacts on families. And so the challenge of getting it passed was always the fact that, unlike other advanced countries, we didn’t start with a system in which everybody was covered, and we have a very complicated marketplace, and we have third-party insurers. And what that meant was that even after we got the law passed anything that dissatisfied people about the health care system could be attributed to -- quote, unquote -- “Obamacare,” even if it had nothing to do with Obamacare. And that was something that we recognized even when we were trying to get the law passed. The other thing is the fact that the unwillingness of Republicans in Congress and around the country, including some governors, to, after the fight was over, say, all right, let’s try to make this work -- the way Democrats did during the time when President Bush tried to expand the prescription drug program, Part D -- meant that the public never heard from those who had originally been opposed any concession that, you know what, this is actually doing some good. And that ends up affecting public opinion. And the third thing is that whenever you look at polls that say 40-something percent are supportive of the law and 40-something percent are dissatisfied -- in the dissatisfied column are a whole bunch of Bernie Sanders supporters who wanted a single-payer plan. And so the problem is not that they think Obamacare is a failure; the problem is that they don't think it went far enough and that it left too many people still uncovered, that the subsidies that people were getting weren’t as rich as they should have been, that there’s a way of dealing with prescription drug makers in a way that drives down those costs. And so all those things meant that even after the law was passed there was going to still be a lot tough politics. Having said all that, the thing that I've been most proud of is the fact that not only have we gotten 20 million people covered, not only have we been able to reduce the pace at which health care costs have been going up -- ever since the law was passed, basically health care inflation has been as low as it's been in 50 years, which has saved the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars, extended the Medicare trust fund by 11 years -- but most importantly, for the people who have gotten insurance through the exchanges, there’s been pretty high satisfaction rates, as surveys have shown. So rather than look at public opinion as a whole, the thing I've been most interested in is, how is this affecting the people who have gotten benefits? These are real families who have gotten real coverage. And I get letters every single day from people who say, this has saved my life, or this has saved my bank account, or this has made sure that my son who got hooked on some sort of opioid was able to get treatment, or I was able to get a mammogram that caught a cancer in time. And that ultimately is the measure of the success of the law.","Alright, Ms. Kliff, let me tell you, it's very simple. They had an *expectation*, you say? An expectation? That's what they got wrong from day one!

They thought that by forcing people into a system, taking away their choices, jacking up their premiums sky-high, and giving them these terrible, high-deductible plans that nobody could actually *use*... they thought that was going to make it popular? Give me a break!

The American people are smart, very smart. They knew it was a disaster. They saw their doctor options disappearing, they saw their costs going up, not down, despite all the promises. ""If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor."" ""If you like your plan, you can keep your plan."" Remember that? Total lie! A total fabrication!

You don't get popular by lying to the public and by destroying a system that, while it had its problems, was still better for many than what they got. It was a complete government takeover of something that should be handled by the private sector, with real competition, with real choices.

So, what did their theory get wrong? They thought they could impose something from Washington that fundamentally didn't work for real families and real businesses, and that people would just embrace it. They got the people wrong. They got the economics wrong. And frankly, they got the *healthcare* wrong. It was a very, very bad bill, and that's why it was never going to be popular. Nobody wants it. We want great healthcare, the best healthcare in the world, and that wasn't it. Not even close!"
" So do you think this dynamic where when you reform the health care system, you own it goes the other way? Republicans are beginning with the repeal-and-delay strategy. President-elect Trump has said that he does want to repeal Obamacare, but he also wants to replace it with something that covers as many people -- or he said that at least at certain points. Do you think that the dynamic in which you became responsible for what people didn’t like is going to hamper Republican movement in their efforts to change a system that maybe they don’t like but does have a lot of people relying on it? ","Well, let me start from a very simple premise: If it works, I’m for it. If something can cover all Americans, make sure that if they have a preexisting condition they can still get coverage, make sure that prescription drugs are affordable, encourage preventive measures to keep people healthy, that makes sure that in rural communities people have access to substance abuse care or mental health care, that Medicare and Medicaid continue to function effectively -- if you can do all that cheaper than we talked about, cheaper than Obamacare achieves and with better quality and it’s just terrific, I’m for it. I think that part of the challenge in this whole debate. And this is true, dating back to 2009, back to 2010, is this idea that somehow we had a fixed way of trying to fix the health care system, that we were rigid and stubborn and wouldn’t welcome Republican ideas, and if we only had, they had all these great solutions. In fact, if you look at how this law evolved -- and I’ve said this publicly before, if I was starting from scratch, I probably would have supported a single-payer system because it’s just easier for people to understand and manage. And that’s essentially what Medicare is, is a single-payer system for people of a certain age. And people are very satisfied with it and it’s not that complicated to understand or to access services. But that wasn’t available; we weren’t starting from scratch. So what did I then do? I said, well, where is a system out there that seems to be providing coverage for everybody that politically we could actually get through a Congress and where we could get Republican support. And lo and behold, in Massachusetts there was a plan that had been designed on a bipartisan basis -- including by a Republican governor who ultimately became the nominee for the Republican Party -- that came close to providing universal coverage. And I would have thought since this was an idea that had previously gotten a lot of Republican support that it would continue to get a lot of Republican support. And yet, somehow, magically, the minute we said this is a great idea and it’s working, Republicans said this is terrible and we don’t want to do this. So I say all this, Ezra, simply to make something very clear. From the very start, in the earliest negotiations in 2009, 2010, I made clear to Republicans that, if they had ideas that they could show would work better than the ideas that we had thought of, I would be happy to incorporate them into the law. And rather than offer ideas, what we got was a big no, we just don’t want to do this. After the law passed, for the last six, seven years, there has been the argument that we can provide a great replacement that will be much better for everybody than what the Affordable Care Act is providing. And yet, over the last six, seven years, there has been no actual replacement law that any credible health care policy experts have said would work better. In fact, many of them would result in millions of people losing coverage and the coverage being worse for those who kept it. And so now is the time when Republicans, I think, have to go ahead and show their cards. If, in fact, they have a program that would genuinely work better and they want to call it whatever they want -- they can call it Trumpcare, they can call it McConnellcare, or Ryancare. If it actually works, I will be the first one to say, great, you should have told me that back in 2009. I asked. I suspect that will not happen. And the reason it will not happen is because if you want to provide coverage to people, then there are certain baseline things that you got to do. Number one, health care is not cheap. And for people who can't afford health care or don’t get it through the job, that means the government has got to pay some money. Number two, all those provisions that the Republicans say they want to keep and that they like -- for example, making sure that people can get health care even if they have a preexisting condition -- well, it turns out that the only way to meet that guarantee is to either make sure that everybody has some modest obligation to get health care so that they're not gaming the system, or you've got to be willing to provide huge subsidies to the insurance companies so that they're taking in people who are already sick. And I think what you're going to see now that you have a Republican President-elect, you have Republicans who control both chambers in Congress -- is that all the promises they made about how they can do it better, cheaper, everybody is going to be satisfied, are going to be really hard to meet. And this is why the strategy of repeal first and replace later is just a huge disservice to the American people, and is something that I think, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, you should be opposed to. These are real lives at stake. I'm getting letters right now from people who say, I am terrified because my son's or daughter's insurance -- their ability to get lifesaving drugs, their ability to get drug treatment, their ability to get mental health services are entirely dependent on us being able to afford and keep our insurance. And if, in fact, there's going to be a massive undoing of what's one-sixth of our economy, then the Republicans need to put forward very specific ideas about how they're going to do it. People need to be able to debate it, they need to be able to study it the same way they did when we passed the Affordable Care Act. And let the American people gauge is this going to result in something better than what Obamacare has produced. And if they're so convinced that they can do it better, they shouldn’t be afraid to make that presentation. It is really interesting to try to figure out why is it that they're trying to rush the repeal so quick. What is it that they're afraid of? Why wouldn’t they want to say, here's our plan, and show, side by side, here's why our plan is better than what Obamacare has produced? Because they have said, absolutely, adamantly, that they can do it better. I am saying to every Republican right now, if you, in fact, can put a plan together that is demonstrably better than what Obamacare is doing, I will publicly support repealing Obamacare and replacing it with your plan. But I want to see it first. I want to see it first. And I want third-party, objective people -- whether it's the Congressional Budget Office or health care experts across the ideological spectrum, or Vox, or whoever --","Look, Obamacare is a disaster. A total disaster. Everyone knows it. It's failing, premiums are skyrocketing, people are losing their doctors – it's just no good. So, the idea that Republicans are going to 'own' this mess? We're fixing a mess we *inherited*. We're not creating it. We're going to repeal it, and we're going to replace it with something *much* better, something that actually works for the American people.

I've said it from day one: We're going to cover everybody, and we're going to do it for less money, and it's going to be so much better healthcare. You're going to have choices, you're going to have great doctors. It's going to be tremendous.

The dynamic you're talking about, where people didn't like what was forced on them? That was Obamacare. That was the Democrats. We're going to put forward a plan that people *will* like, because it's going to be smart, it's going to be market-based, and it's going to be about great healthcare. We won't be hampered, because we're doing the right thing for the country. Believe me."
" We'd be happy to, yes. ","-- to just evaluate it. And the public will not have to take my word for it. They can -- we can designate some referees. And if they can show that they can do it better, cheaper, more effective, provide better coverage, why wouldn’t I be for it? Why wouldn’t I be for it? This idea that somehow, oh, this is about Obama preserving his legacy -- keep in mind, I'm not the one who named it Obamacare. They were the ones who named it Obamacare, because what they wanted to do was personalize this and feed on antipathy towards me in their party as an organizing tool, as politics. But I don’t have a pride of authorship on this thing. If they can come up with something better, I'm for it. But you have to show -- and I would advise every Democrat to be for it -- but you have to show that it's better. And that's not too much to ask. And that's the challenge. And the question right now for Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell is, why is it that you feel obliged to repeal it before you show what it is that is going to replace? Because the majority of Americans have been very clear that they think that's a bad idea. You now have Republican governors, some Republican senators, who have said, we don’t think that's a good idea. And there's been no real explanation to why you would actually try to do this before the new President is even inaugurated. What exactly is this rush? Particularly if you're going to delay the actual repeal. If they were making the argument that this is so disastrous that we actually think we have to repeal it completely today because it's just terrible, well, I would disagree, but at least I could understand it. But here you're saying, we're going to vote to repeal, but then were going to delay its effects for a couple of years. Well, why, if it's so bad? And if the answer is, well, it would be disruptive and we don't want to take people’s insurance away right away, well, then that means you have time to show us and, more importantly, show the American people who need health insurance what exactly you're replacing it with. In that sense -- Ezra, I know that was a long answer but in that sense, the answer is the Republicans, yes, will own the problems with the health care system if they choose to repeal something that is providing health insurance to a lot of people, and providing benefits to every American who has health insurance even if they’re getting it through the job, and they haven't shown us what it is that they’re going to do. Then they do own it. Because that is irresponsible. And even members of their own party, even those who are opposed to me, have said that that is an irresponsible thing to do. Ms. Kliff: Let me follow up a little bit on the congressional fight. So we saw yesterday President-elect Donald Trump, he said yesterday on Twitter, “It's time for Republicans and Democrats to get together and come up with a health care plan that really works” -- which is something -- I remember you saying similar things in 2009, 2010, when I was covering this debate. Knowing what you know now about partisanship, a President who has tried to do this, was, like you said, unable to get Republican votes -- what three pieces of advice would you give someone trying to attempt to pass a bipartisan health care law?","Well, I appreciate that. I really do. You know, it's that spirit of cooperation, that willingness to roll up our sleeves and work together, that truly makes a difference. That's how we move this country forward, by finding common ground and building a brighter future for all Americans. Thank you."
" I think Obamacare has exposed an interesting tension between controlling costs in the system and controlling economic pain for individuals. So the law has, until now, come in under budget. But part of the ways it's done that are higher deductibles than people expected, higher co-pays now in networks. In a couple of years, if it doesn’t change, the excise tax on high-value insurance will come into play, the individual mandate. And these things -- individual people -- while they keep the usage of health care down and they keep the cost of health care down, they make health care feel more expensive. They make health care feel unusable. Do you think the Affordable Care Act got the balance right on controlling system-wide costs versus insulating individuals from their health expenses? ","Well, let me make a couple distinctions. First of all, part of what happened at the beginning of the marketplaces -- and for those who aren't wonks -- I was teasing Ezra and Sarah, I said this is like a Wonkapalooza. This is some serious policy detail, here. But so the marketplaces are basically just those places where insurers put up, here’s the insurance package we're offering, and you can choose from a variety of different packages, and then once you’ve chosen you can figure out the subsidies that you're qualified for and that will give you a sense of what your out-of-pocket costs are. And what we discovered was that a lot of insurers underpriced early on, because they had done surveys and -- look, people who are purchasing health insurance are like people who are purchasing everything else, they like to get the best deal for the lowest price. What makes health care tricky is, when you buy a TV you can kind of see what the picture looks like; when you're buying health insurance it's tempting to initially buy the cheapest thing -- until, heaven forbid, you get sick and it turns out, gosh, I can't see the doctor I want or the specialist I want, or this is more inconvenient than I expected. So what ended up happening was people bought, oftentimes, the cheapest insurance that they could. Insurance companies, wanting to get as much market share as possible, ended up creating very low-cost plans, but those are going to have restrictions on them. And that's not just if you're buying health insurance in Obamacare, that's generally how it is even when employers buy health insurance for their employees. Now, I think that what we're seeing is insurers now making adjustments, saying, okay, we need to charge more. And that is something that, the good news is, appears to -- may have stabilized and might be kind of a one-time thing, and now we're in a position to be able to do an evaluation of have we gotten this balance right, as you say. We can't get health care for free. You're going to have to pay for it one way or another. Either the government is going to pay more so that people don't have as many out-of-pocket costs -- and that means, in some fashion, higher taxes for somebody -- or individuals are going to have to pay more out of pocket in one way or another. The same is true for employers. Either employers pay more for a really good health care package, but that takes something out of the employer’s bottom line, or they’re putting more costs onto workers in the form of higher deductibles and higher co-pays. And I think that a lot of the good work that can be done in lowering costs had to do not with cost shifting, but with actually making the system work better. And we've done a lot of work on that. What I referred to earlier, incentivizing a system that instead of ordering five tests because doctors and providers are getting paid for the test, you now have a system where you're going to get reimbursed if the person gets healthy quicker and is not returned to the hospital. Well, it turns out that that can, over time, be a real cost reduction. 0 Those are the kinds of things that we're implementing in the system as a consequence of Obamacare. The more we do that kind of stuff the less we're going to see this cost shifting. But the intention has never been to say let’s make it more expensive for people to get health care so they’re going to access the system more. And I think the proof of that is, is that even though per-person costs have not gone up a lot, the overall spending on health care has gone up because more people have come into the system. We want people to use the health care system. We just don't want them to use it in the emergency room. We want them to use it to stay healthy -- and smoking cessation plans, and making sure that they’re getting regular checkups and mammograms, those are the things that are ultimately going to save us as much money as we can. Ms. Kliff: I have a wonky follow-up question.","Well, look, that's a darn good question, and it gets right to the heart of the matter, doesn't it? The idea, you know, of trying to get costs down in our healthcare system, that's something we can all agree on. Nobody wants healthcare to be unaffordable.

But when you talk about the Affordable Care Act, what we've seen, plain and simple, is that it didn't really get the balance right at all. Not for the average American family, it didn't.

They said ""affordable,"" but what did folks get? Higher deductibles, making it so you're paying thousands out of pocket before your insurance even kicks in. What good is that policy if you're afraid to use it because of the astronomical cost *after* paying your premium? People feel like they're just paying for the *privilege* of paying more later. That's not affordable care; that's just a more expensive bill.

And those narrow networks, limiting where you can go, taking away your choice of doctor or hospital. That's not freedom, that's not better care. That's a reduction in service packaged as a cost-saving measure, and it just means less access for everyday Americans.

Then you've got that individual mandate, telling folks they *have* to buy something, or the government's going to hit 'em with a penalty. That's just not the American way. We believe in freedom and individual responsibility, not mandates from Washington.

And don't even get me started on the so-called ""Cadillac tax"" on good, high-value employer-sponsored plans. That tax, if it ever fully comes into play, would punish good employers and good workers for having solid health coverage. It's designed to lower costs by making *good* insurance too expensive!

So, while they might trot out numbers about being ""under budget,"" what they don't tell you is that budget got balanced on the backs of hardworking families who are now paying more for less, or simply can't afford to use the care they're paying for. It made healthcare *feel* more expensive, and for many, it *is* more expensive and less accessible.

We need real solutions that empower individuals, that promote competition across state lines, that let doctors and patients make decisions, not bureaucrats in Washington. That's how you truly get costs down and put power and choice back in the hands of the American people, where it belongs. The ACA, sadly, missed the mark on that balance, big time."
 I think we're quite low. ,We got low time? Because I got all kinds of more stuff.,"Well, I hear you, and it's a feeling a lot of folks have from time to time, whether it's about the economy, or just the sense of where we're headed as a country.

But let me tell you, I've always had immense faith in the American people. We've faced bigger challenges, and we've always found a way to come back stronger, to innovate, to rebuild. It just takes a little bit of common sense, working together, and making sure everyone has a fair shot.

We can absolutely lift things up. We just gotta focus on opportunity and make sure our future is brighter for everyone."
" Well, it's your schedule. We're happy to keep you as long as you'd like. ","Well, there are a couple points I want to make in closing --","Well, I appreciate that very much. That's mighty generous of you to offer. We've had a real good, productive discussion here today, and I'm grateful for your time and your insights.

But you know how it is, the clock keeps ticking, and we've got a full schedule ahead of us. Got to keep this country moving forward. Thank you, thank you very much."
 Excellent. ,-- but why don’t you ask some questions.,"Well, thank you. Glad to hear that. We aim for excellence, that's what we do. It's always a good day when folks recognize the good work being done."
" So one thing we haven’t touched on yet in much detail is the delivery system of follow-ups, which are a big part of the law. So what is a policy or experiment or change in that space that has over-performed your expectations? And what's one that has maybe not panned out as you’d liked or hoped? ","You know, I think a good example of something that's worked better than we expected, or at least worked as well as we expected is the issue of hospital readmissions. Now, it turns out that a lot of times you go to the hospital -- let's say, you get your appendix taken out, and then you go home and then there's a complication, and then you have to go back into the hospital. That's obviously inconvenient for you and it's expensive for the system as a whole. And it turns out that there are just a few things that you can do that help reduce people being readmitted. First of all, making sure that the first procedure goes well, but, secondly, making sure that there's good follow-up. So it might be that a hospital or a health care system pays for, when you do go home, you just getting some phone calls to remind you to take the medicine that you got to take to make sure you heal properly -- because they may have done a study and it turns out that people forget to do what they're supposed to do, they don’t follow exactly their doctor's instructions, and they can't afford to have a nurse in their house who's doing it for them. Well, maybe there are just a few things that can be done to help make sure that they do what they are supposed to do, and that way they don’t have complications. 6 What we've seen is a significant reduction in hospital readmissions over the course of this law just by doing some smart incentivizing, just saying to the hospitals we'll reimburse you or we'll give you some other benefit for doing smart follow-up. That's an area where I think we've made some real progress. The other place -- and this is connected -- where I think we've got some good bipartisan support is just encouraging what's called -- shifting from what's called fee-for-service payments, where you get paid by the procedure, which means that you may end up getting five tests instead of getting one test that's emailed to five providers who are treating you. And we've started to see some real movement when we say to the system as a whole we're going to pay you for outcomes -- did the patient do well. And that has been helpful. In terms of areas where I think we haven’t seen as much improvement as I'd like, it's probably -- one thing that comes to mind is on the electronic medical records. If you think about how wired and plugged in everybody is now -- I mean, you can basically do everything off your phone. The fact that there are still just mountains of paperwork, and you don’t understand what these bills are that still get sent to your house, and nobody -- and the doctors still have to input stuff, and the nurses are spending all their time on all this administrative work -- we put a big slug of money into trying to encourage everybody to digitalize, catch up with the rest of the world here. And it's proven to be harder than we expected, partly because everybody has different systems, they don’t all talk to each other. It requires retraining people in how to use them effectively. And I'm optimistic that over time it's inevitable that it's going to get better, because every other part of our lives, it's become paperless. But it's been a lot slower than I would have expected. And some of it has to do with the fact that, as I said, it's decentralized and everybody has different systems. In some cases, you have sort of economic incentives that are pushing against making the system work better. For example, there are service providers -- people make money on keeping people's medical records, so making it easier for everybody to access each other's medical records means that there are some folks who could lose business. And that has turned out to be a little more complicated than I expected. 7 Ms. Kliff: Do you have any closing remarks? And one thing I'm interested in is kind of what you see your role in this debate we're gearing up for.","Well, look, when you talk about the delivery system of follow-ups, especially in the context of the law and government policy, you're really hitting on the heart of effective governance: ensuring that what we put on paper actually translates into tangible results for the American people. It's about accountability, frankly, and making sure the job gets done.

One area that I believe truly *over-performed* expectations during my time was the increased emphasis and implementation of **performance-based contracting and monitoring systems**, particularly within federal agencies dealing with defense and complex infrastructure projects. For too long, government contracts had been awarded with fairly loose follow-up, often leading to cost overruns and delays. We pushed hard for very specific metrics, clear deliverables, and a robust system of regular, detailed progress reports that contractors had to meet or face penalties. We strengthened the oversight divisions within departments and encouraged direct, on-site verification. Now, this wasn't revolutionary in concept, but the rigor with which we applied it, really insisting on tangible proof of progress and timely delivery, far exceeded what many of the old guard thought possible. It streamlined projects, saved taxpayer dollars, and frankly, injected a lot more discipline into how the government managed its vast portfolio of work. The transparency it brought to the follow-up process was truly a game-changer.

On the other side of the coin, an experiment that perhaps **didn't quite pan out** as we'd hoped involved a push for a more centralized, 'one-stop-shop' digital platform for all federal grant reporting and compliance follow-ups, particularly for smaller non-profits and community organizations. The idea was noble: simplify the process, reduce paperwork, and make it easier for these vital groups to report on how federal dollars were being used, rather than dealing with a maze of different agency forms and timelines. We wanted to move beyond paper, into a more efficient, unified digital system. However, what we ran into was a wall of complexity – the sheer diversity of grant requirements, the varying technical capabilities of thousands of small organizations, and the challenge of integrating disparate existing agency databases. While the *concept* of making follow-ups easier was sound, the practical implementation became cumbersome. It was meant to simplify, but for many, it actually added another layer of confusion in the early stages, as agencies struggled to standardize and local groups struggled to adapt to a single, rigid system that didn't always fit their specific needs. It was a good lesson in remembering that sometimes, even with the best intentions for efficiency, the human element and the practical realities on the ground are tougher to navigate than any policy paper might suggest. You can't just mandate change and expect everyone to fall in line overnight."
 It’s not that hard to do. ,"-- getting the details of all this policy is hard. It’s complicated. You don’t know what’s true; you don’t know what’s not true. 0 I mean, those folks in Kentucky that you’ve signed up -- there are a lot of people who voted for not just a President, but also for a member of Congress who said, explicitly, we’re going to eliminate this. Well, I understand why people might think, okay, well, he’s going to eliminate it, but he will give us something better. But this is hard. And what you don’t want is a situation where they make a promise that they can’t keep. And I’ve worked on this a long time. If we had had a better way to do this, we would have done it. It would have been in my interest to do it, because I knew I was going to be judged on whether or not it worked. And those areas that don’t work had to do with there not being enough money in the system and not having a public option. And I’m more than happy to put those fixes in place, anytime, anyplace. But that’s not, so far, what the Republicans are proposing. You deserve to know what it is that they’re doing. So, anyway, I appreciate you guys taking the time to tell the story.","You know, you're absolutely right! A lot of people try to make things sound complicated, almost impossible, when really, with a little common sense and a strong vision, it's really not that hard at all.

We proved that time and time again. You just need the right people, the right mindset, and you get it done. Believe me."
" Real quick, Sarah had asked about your role going forward. ","Oh, my role going forward? Well, look, I mean, I do deserve a little sleep. And I’ve got to take Michelle on a vacation. But I’ve said consistently that the most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen. And I will be a citizen who still remembers what it was like when his mom died of cancer younger than I am now, and who didn’t have all the insurance and disability insurance and support, and wasn’t using the health care system enough to have early detection that might have prevented her from passing away. You know, Michelle’s dad had multiple sclerosis -- MS -- but was part of that generation that just didn’t have a lot of expectations about health care and so just kind of suffered for years. I mean, those are our stories. So it’s not like I’m going to suddenly fade away on this. I will be a part of the work of our fellow citizens in trying to make sure that the wealthiest country on Earth is able to do the same thing that every other advanced country is able to do. I mean, it’s not as if this has never been done before. If you’re in Canada, you got health care, no matter who you are. If you’re in France, you got health care. If you’re in England, you got health care. If you’re in Australia, you got health care. If you’re in New Zealand, you got health care. 1 I remember talking to my friend, John Key, who was the Prime Minister of New Zealand. He is part of the Conservative Party in New Zealand. And he said to me in the middle of this health care debate, he said, boy, if I proposed that we took away people’s health care, that we repealed it, I’d be run out of office by my own party. Because it was just assumed that, in a country this wealthy that this is one of the basic rights, not privileges, of citizenship in a well- to-do country like ours. So I’ll be working with all of you. But my voice is going to be less important than the voices of people who are directly affected. And so I would urge everybody to make your voice heard. Now is the time to do it. The people who have opposed this were opposing it not based on facts, but were opposing it based on sort of an ideological concern about expansion on the state, and taxes on wealthier people that are helping people who don’t have as much money. And I respect their role in the democracy. They’ve been really fighting hard. Well, folks here got to fight just as hard. My final piece of advice would be to the news media, which is, generally speaking, when Obamacare has worked well it wasn’t attributed to Obamacare, and when there were problems they got front-page headlines. And I think that, hopefully, now is a time where people can be a little -- this doesn’t apply to Vox, by the way. But I think it would be a good time for people to be a little more measured and take a look at what are the facts of this thing. Because the stakes are high. Even on this whole premium issue -- increase issue that happened right before the election, it is true, as I said, that insurers adjusted and hiked premiums. But I kept on trying to explain, number one, if you’re getting a tax subsidy, this wasn’t going to affect your out-of-pocket costs because the tax credit would just go up. But nobody kind of heard that. And number two, these increases in premiums only applied to people who were buying health insurance on the exchanges. In fact, 85 percent of the people don’t get health insurance through Obamacare. And for you, your health care premiums actually have gone up a lot less since Obamacare was passed than they did before Obamacare was passed. The average family has probably saved about $3,000 in lower health care premiums than if you had seen those same health care cost trends increase at the pace that they did before the law was 2 passed. But I didn’t see a lot of headlines about that -- which I understand, I mean because it’s not controversial enough, or it’s a little bit too complicated to get in a sound bite. So that’s why the individual voice is so important. And that’s why I’m so appreciative of journalists who actually know what they’re talking about.","Sarah, bless her heart, always got a good question. My role going forward, pal? It's the same role it's always been: to lead this great country. We've got important work to do, always have. We're gonna keep our eye on the ball, stay focused on the priorities of the American people, and make sure we're delivering on our promises. No time for slowing down now, we're just getting started. You tell her that."
 I'm staying put. ,"Jeff Mason, Reuters.","Good! Very strong. Sometimes, you gotta stay right where you are, hold the line. That's what we're doing. We're not moving. We're building, we're making tremendous progress, and believe me, it's the right move. Smart."
" Thank you, sir. Are you concerned, Mr. President, that commuting Chelsea Manning’s sentence will send a message that leaking classified material will not generate a tough sentence to groups like WikiLeaks? How do you reconcile that in light of WikiLeaks’ connection to Russia’s hacking in last year’s election? And related to that, Julian Assange has now offered to come to the United States. Are you seeking that? And would he be charged or arrested if he came here? ","Well, first of all, let’s be clear, Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence. So the notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital, classified information would think that it goes unpunished I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served. It has been my view that given she went to trial, that due process was carried out, that she took responsibility for her crime, that the sentence that she received was very disproportional -- disproportionate relative to what other leakers had received, and that she had served a significant amount of time, that it made it sense to commute -- and not pardon -- her sentence. And I feel very comfortable that justice has been served and that a message has still been sent that when it comes to our national security, that wherever possible, we need folks who may have legitimate concerns about the actions of government or their superiors or the agencies in which they work -- that they try to work through the established channels and avail themselves of the whistleblower protections that had been put in place. I recognize that there’s some folks who think they're not enough, and I think all of us, when we're working in big institutions, may find ourselves at times at odds with policies that are set. But when it comes to national security, we're often dealing with people in the field whose lives may be put at risk, or the safety and security and the ability of our military or our intelligence teams or embassies to function effectively. And that has to be kept in mind. So with respect to WikiLeaks, I don't see a contradiction. First of all, I haven't commented on WikiLeaks, generally. The conclusions of the intelligence community with respect to the Russian hacking were not conclusive as to whether WikiLeaks was witting or not in being the conduit through which we heard about the DNC emails that were leaked. I don't pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange's tweets, so that wasn't a consideration in this instance. And I'd refer you to the Justice Department for any criminal investigations, indictments, extradition issues that may come up with him. What I can say broadly is that, in this new cyber age, we're going to have to make sure that we continually work to find the right balance of accountability and openness and transparency that is the hallmark of our democracy, but also recognize that there are adversaries and bad actors out there who want to use that same openness in ways that hurt us -- whether that's in trying to commit financial crimes, or trying to commit acts of terrorism, or folks who want to interfere with our elections. And we're going to have to continually build the kind of architecture that makes sure the best of our democracy is preserved; that our national security and intelligence agencies have the ability to carry out policy without advertising to our adversaries what it is that we're doing, but do so in a way that still keeps citizens up to speed on what their government is doing on their behalf. But with respect to Chelsea Manning, I looked at the particulars of this case the same way I have for the other commutations and pardons that I've done, and I felt that in light of all the circumstances that commuting her sentence was entirely appropriate. Margaret Brennan.","Thank you for the question. Let me be clear on this: The unauthorized disclosure of classified information is a grave disservice to our nation's security and puts the lives of our servicemen and women, and our intelligence professionals, at risk. We take that very, very seriously.

Regarding the commutation of Chelsea Manning's sentence, decisions like that are often made after careful consideration of a variety of factors, including time served. However, that specific action does not, and should not, diminish the understanding that leaking classified material carries severe consequences under the law. My administration will always prioritize the protection of our intelligence and our sources.

As for WikiLeaks and its connection to foreign interference in our elections, that's a different matter entirely. Any attempt by a foreign power to meddle in our democratic process is unacceptable, and we are working to ensure that such activities are met with a firm and decisive response. We condemn any organization that willingly aids and abets such interference.

And on the matter of Mr. Assange, the Department of Justice handles these issues. If he were to come to the United States, he would face the American justice system, like anyone else. We are a nation of laws, and no one is above them. Those decisions on charges and arrests are made by the appropriate legal authorities, and I trust them to uphold the rule of law."
" Mr. President, thank you. The President-elect has said that he would consider lifting sanctions on Russia if they substantially reduced their nuclear stockpile. Given your own efforts at arms control, do you think that's an effective strategy? Knowing this office and Mr. Trump, how would you advise his advisors to help him be effective when he deals with Vladimir Putin? And given your actions recently on Russia, do you think those sanctions should be viewed as leverage? ","Well, a couple of things. Number one, I think it is in America's interest and the world's interest that we have a constructive relationship with Russia. That's been my approach throughout my presidency. Where our interests have overlapped, we've worked together. At the beginning of my term, I did what I could to encourage Russia to be a constructive member of the international community, and tried to work with the President and the government of Russia in helping them diversify their economy, improve their economy, use the incredible talents of the Russian people in more constructive ways. I think it’s fair to say that after President Putin came back into the presidency that an escalating anti-American rhetoric and an approach to global affairs that seemed to be premised on the idea that whatever America is trying to do must be bad for Russia and so we want to try and counteract whatever they do -- that return to an adversarial spirit that I think existed during the Cold War has made the relationship more difficult. And it was hammered home when Russia went into Crimea and portions of Ukraine. The reason we imposed the sanctions, recall, was not because of nuclear weapons issues. It was because the independence and sovereignty of a country, Ukraine, had been encroached upon, by force, by Russia. That wasn’t our judgment; that was the judgment of the entire international community. And Russia continues to occupy Ukrainian territory and meddle in Ukrainian affairs and support military surrogates who have violated basic international law and international norms. What I’ve said to the Russians is, as soon as you’ve stop doing that the sanctions will be removed. And I think it would probably best serve not only American interest but also the interest of preserving international norms if we made sure that we don’t confuse why these sanctions have been imposed with a whole set of other issues. On nuclear issues, in my first term we negotiated the START II treaty. and that has substantially reduced our nuclear stockpiles, both Russia and the United States. I was prepared to go further. I told President Putin I was prepared to go further. They have been unwilling to negotiate. If President-elect Trump is able to restart those talks in a serious way, I think there remains a lot of room for our two countries to reduce our stockpiles. And part of the reason we’ve been successful on our nonproliferation agenda and on our nuclear security agenda is because we were leading by example. I hope that continues. But I think it’s important just to remember that the reason sanctions have been put in place against Russia has to do with their actions in Ukraine. And it is important for the United States to stand up for the basic principle that big countries don’t go around and invade and bully smaller countries. I’ve said before, I expect Russia and Ukraine to have a strong relationship. They are, historically, bound together in all sorts of cultural and social ways. But Ukraine is an independent country. And this is a good example of the vital role that America has to continue to play around the world in preserving basic norms and values, whether it’s advocating on behalf of human rights, advocating on behalf of women’s rights, advocating on behalf of freedom of the press. The United States has not always been perfect in this regard. There are times where we, by necessity, are dealing with allies or friends or partners who, themselves, are not meeting the standards that we would like to see met when it comes to international rules and norms. But I can tell you that in every multilateral setting -- in the United Nations, in the G20, in the G7 - - the United States typically has been on the right side of these issues. And it is important for us to continue to be on the right side of these issues, because if we, the largest, strongest country and democracy in the world, are not willing to stand up on behalf of these values, then certainly China, Russia, and others will not. Kevin Corke.","Well, that's certainly an interesting proposition from the President-elect, and one that, at first glance, holds a certain appeal, especially for someone who spent a good deal of his career trying to bring down those nuclear stockpiles. My experience, going back to negotiating with the Soviets, taught me that arms control is a patient business, built on trust but, more importantly, on verifiable actions. You don't just take a promise to the bank. Any reduction in nuclear arms, from anyone, is a step in the right direction for global security. But whether lifting sanctions is the *effective* way to achieve it depends entirely on the details, the scope of the reduction, and the absolute certainty of verification. It must be ironclad. We always sought deep, reciprocal cuts, and always with eyes on the ground.

Now, dealing with Mr. Putin... he's a very shrewd operator, a man who understands power and projection. My advice to President-elect Trump's advisors, and frankly to any president facing a leader like Putin, would be threefold. First, know your brief inside and out. Don't go into any meeting without the best intelligence, the best diplomatic analysis, and a clear understanding of your own strategic objectives. Second, lean heavily on your allies. Putin respects strength, and a united front with our European partners and others sends a far more powerful message than any unilateral stance. Don't underestimate the power of that coalition. Third, be firm but always leave room for negotiation. You want to deter aggression, but you also want to find common ground where mutual interests align, even if those interests are narrow. It's about maintaining a steady hand, not getting swept up in the moment. And don't personalize it too much; it's about national interests, not personal relationships.

As for those sanctions... oh, absolutely. Sanctions, when applied judiciously and with a clear purpose, are a critical tool in the diplomatic toolkit. They're not meant to be permanent fixtures; they're meant to influence behavior. We used them, in various forms, to press for human rights, to encourage democratic reforms, to push back against aggression. In the case of Russia, these sanctions are a direct response to specific actions – the annexation of Crimea, destabilization in Ukraine, interference. They *must* be viewed as leverage. They provide the incentive for Russia to change its course, to adhere to international norms. To give them up without a concrete, verifiable, and significant change in behavior would be, in my humble opinion, a serious strategic misstep. You don't give away your chips for free; you use them to achieve your policy goals."
" Thank you, Mr. President. You have been a strong supporter of the idea of a peaceful transfer of power, demonstrated not terribly far from the Rose Garden. And yet, even as you and I speak, there are more than five dozen Democrats that are going to boycott the inauguration of the incoming President. Do you support that? And what message would you send to Democrats to better demonstrate the peaceful transfer of power? And if I could follow, I wanted to ask you about your conversations with the President-elect previously. And without getting into too much of the personal side of it, I’m just curious, were you able to use that opportunity to convince him to take a fresh look at some of the important ideas that you will leave this office with -- maintaining some semblance of the Affordable Care Act, some idea of keeping DREAMers here in the country without fear of deportation. Were you able to use personal stories to try to convince him? And how successful were you? ","Well, I won’t go into details of my conversations with President-elect Trump. As I’ve said before, they are cordial. At times they've been fairly lengthy and they've been substantive. I can't tell you how convincing I’ve been. I think you'd had to ask him whether I’ve been convincing or not. I have offered my best advice, counsel about certain issues both foreign and domestic. And my working assumption is, is that having won an election opposed to a number of my initiatives and certain aspects of my vision for where the country needs to go, it is appropriate for him to go forward with his vision and his values. And I don't expect that there’s going to be enormous overlap. It may be that on certain issues, once he comes into office and he looks at the complexities of how to, in fact, provide health care for everybody -- something he says he wants to do -- or wants to make sure that he is encouraging job creation and wage growth in this country, that that may lead him to some of the same conclusions that I arrived at once I got here. But I don't think we’ll know until he has an actual chance to get sworn in and sit behind that desk. And I think a lot of his views are going to be shaped by his advisors, the people around him -- which is why it’s important to pay attention to these confirmation hearings. I can tell you that -- and this is something I have told him -- that this is a job of such magnitude that you can't do it by yourself. You are enormously reliant on a team. Your Cabinet, your senior White House staff, all the way to fairly junior folks in their 20s and 30s, but who are executing on significant responsibilities. And so how you put a team together to make sure that they're getting you the best information and they are teeing up the options from which you will ultimately make decisions, that's probably the most useful advice, the most constructive advice that I've been able to give him. That if you find yourself isolated because the process breaks down, or if you're only hearing from people who agree with you on everything, or if you haven’t created a process that is fact-checking and probing and asking hard questions about policies or promises that you've made, that's when you start making mistakes. And as I indicated in some of my previous remarks, reality has a way of biting back if you're not paying attention to it. With respect to the inauguration, I'm not going to comment on those issues. All I know is I'm going to be there. So is Michelle. And I have been checking the weather, and I'm heartened by the fact that it won't be as cold as my first inauguration because that was cold. Jen Rodriguez.","Well, thank you, son. Thank you for that question. And it’s good to be here with you.

Look, the peaceful transfer of power, it’s not just some fancy phrase, you know? It’s the bedrock. It’s what sets us apart as Americans. From the very beginning of this grand experiment, we've understood that even when the chips fall differently than you hoped, when the people make their choice, you stand up, you shake hands, and you ensure the republic endures. It’s bigger than any one of us, bigger than any party. And yes, my own experience, not too far from that Rose Garden, taught me that deeply. You carry on, because the country needs you to.

Now, regarding those Democrats who are choosing not to attend the inauguration... well, that's certainly their prerogative, isn't it? This is a free country, and people make their own choices, for their own reasons. And I understand that emotions run high, they always do in politics. But my message to them, and indeed to all Americans, would be this: The institution, the office of the President, the country itself – these are things we must always hold in reverence. Showing up, even when it's tough, even when you disagree fundamentally, shows a respect for the process, for the Constitution, and for the mandate of the American people. It shows a unified front to the world. And that's critical. We can disagree vigorously, but we must always remember we're all on the same team in the end, striving for a more perfect union. It's about bringing people together, not pulling them further apart.

As for my conversations with the President-elect... you know, those are private discussions, steeped in the tradition of this office, and I'd like to keep the specifics between us. But I can tell you this much: I believe it is a sacred duty for any outgoing President to offer the incoming one the full benefit of their experience, their insights, and their perspective. My hope, my sincere hope, was to impart some of the lessons I've learned about the awesome responsibility of this office.

We certainly spoke about the challenges facing our nation, about the need to ensure *all* Americans have access to quality healthcare, about the importance of treating people with dignity and finding common ground on complex issues like immigration, particularly for those young people who've grown up knowing no other home. I shared my thoughts, yes, and I certainly drew upon experiences, upon stories, to illustrate the human impact of policy decisions. It’s not about ""convincing"" in the sense of one-upping or changing minds wholesale. It's about planting seeds, about offering a different lens through which to view the issues, about emphasizing the long-term good of the nation.

How successful was I? Well, that's for history to judge, and for the incoming administration to demonstrate. But I left those conversations feeling I had done my part, passed on what I could for the good of the country. And that's all any of us can ever truly ask. You give it your best, you share your heart, and you trust in the strength of our democratic institutions."
" Right here, Mr. President. Thank you very much. You have said that you would come back to fight for the DREAMers. You said that a couple of weeks ago. Are you fearful for the status of those DREAMers, the future of the young immigrants and all immigrants in this country with the new administration? And what did you mean when you said you would come back? Would you lobby Congress? Maybe explore the political arena again? And if I may ask you a second question -- why did you take action on ""dry foot, wet foot"" a week ago? ","Well, let me be absolutely clear. I did not mean that I was going to be running for anything anytime soon. What I meant is that it's important for me to take some time to process this amazing experience that we've gone through; to make sure that my wife, with whom I will be celebrating a 25th anniversary this year, is willing to re-up and put up with me for a little bit longer. I want to do some writing. I want to be quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk so darn much. I want to spend precious time with my girls. So those are my priorities this year. But as I said before, I'm still a citizen. And I think it is important for Democrats or progressives who feel that they came out on the wrong side of this election to be able to distinguish between the normal back-and-forth, ebb and flow of policy -- are we going to raise taxes or are we going to lower taxes; are we going to expand this program or eliminate this program; how concerned are we about air pollution or climate change. Those are all normal parts of the debate. And as I've said before, in a democracy, sometimes you're going to win on those issues and sometimes you're going to lose. I'm confident about the rightness of my positions on a lot of these points, but we got a new President and a Congress that are going to make their same determinations. And there will be a back-and-forth in Congress around those issues, and you guys will report on all that. But there's difference between that normal functioning of politics and certain issues or certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake. I put in that category, if I saw systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion. I'd put in that category, explicit or functional obstacles to people being able to vote, to exercise their franchise. I'd put in that category, institutional efforts to silence dissent or the press. And for me, at least, I would put in that category, efforts to round up kids who have grown up here and for all practical purposes are American kids and send them someplace else when they love this country; they are our kids' friends and their classmates, and are now entering into community colleges or, in some cases, serving in our military. The notion that we would just arbitrarily, or because of politics, punish those kids when they didn't do anything wrong themselves I think would be something that would merit me speaking out. It doesn't mean that I would get on the ballot anywhere. With respect to “wet foot, dry foot,” we underwent a monumental shift in our policy towards Cuba. My view was, after 50 years of a policy not working, it made sense for us to try to reopen diplomatic relations, to engage a Cuban government, to be honest with them about the strong disagreements we have around political repression and treatment of dissenters and freedom of press and freedom of religion, but that to make progress for the Cuban people, our best shot was to suddenly have the Cuban people interacting with Americans, and seeing the incredible success of the Cuban American community, and engaging in commerce and business and trade, and that it was through that process of opening up these bilateral relations that you would see over time serious and significant improvement. Given that shift in the relationship, the policy that we had in place was “wet foot, dry foot,” which treated Cuban émigrés completely different from folks from El Salvador, or Guatemala, or Nicaragua, or any other part of the world, one that made a distinction between whether you got here by land or by foot -- that was a carryover of a old way of thinking that didn't make sense in this day and age, particularly as we're opening up travel between the two countries. And so we had very lengthy consultations with the Department of Homeland Security. We had some tough negotiations with the Cuban government. But we arrived at a policy which we think is both fair and appropriate to the changing nature of the relationship between the two countries. Nadia Bilbassy.","Well, thank you very much for being here. Good to see you.

Look, when it comes to the DREAMers, I believe very strongly in the promise of America. These young men and women, they were brought here as children, through no fault of their own. They've grown up in our schools, pledged allegiance to our flag, and contributed to our communities. They *are* Americans, in every way but on paper. And yes, I am concerned that we find a compassionate and lasting solution for them. We are a nation of laws, yes, but we are also a nation of heart. It is critical that we figure out a pathway for these young people so they can continue to make our country stronger.

When I said I'd ""come back to fight,"" what I meant was this: As a former President, I believe I have a responsibility to speak out on issues of conscience, to use my voice to encourage thoughtful leadership. I'll engage with leaders on both sides of the aisle – and I believe this is an issue that should transcend partisan politics. I'll remind people of our founding principles, of the power of the American dream. I'm not looking to run for office again, you know, my golf game needs a lot more work than that. But I will always advocate for policies that are both strong and compassionate, that uphold the dignity of every individual, and that strengthen our nation.

Now, regarding the ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy, that was a decision, as you know, made by the *previous administration* very recently, in the final days of their term. My administration always emphasized human rights and stability in our foreign policy, including with Cuba. We worked for a secure border, and for legal, orderly immigration. Any policy, whether it's ""wet foot, dry foot"" or any other, needs to be evaluated over time to ensure it serves our national interests and doesn't create unintended consequences, like encouraging dangerous journeys. It's a complex issue, with significant implications for people seeking freedom, and it requires careful consideration from the administration in charge."
" Thank you, sir. I appreciate the opportunity, and I want you and your family best of luck in the future. ",Thank you.,"Well, thank you, I appreciate that very much. That means a great deal to me, it truly does. And let me tell you, I wish you and your family nothing but the very best as well. It's good people like you who make this country so special, and I'm just glad we had this chance to connect. Take care now."
" Mr. President, you have been criticized and even personally attacked for the U.N. Security Council resolution that considered the Israeli settlements illegal and an obstacle to peace. Mr. Trump promised to move the embassy to Jerusalem. He appointed an ambassador that doesn't believe in the two-state solution. How worried are you about the U.S. leadership in the Arab world and beyond as an honest broker? Will this ignite a third intifada? Will this even protect Israel? And in retrospect, do you think that you should have held Israel more accountable, like President Bush, Senior, did with the loan guarantees? Thank you. ","I continue to be significantly worried about the Israeli-Palestinian issue. And I’m worried about it both because I think the status quo is unsustainable, that it is dangerous for Israel, that it is bad for Palestinians, it is bad for the region, and it is bad for America’s national security. And I came into this office wanting to do everything I could to encourage serious peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. And we invested a lot of energy, a lot of time, a lot of effort, first year, second year, all the way until last year. Ultimately, what has always been clear is that we cannot force the parties to arrive at peace. What we can do is facilitate, provide a platform, encourage. But we can't force them to do it. 0 But in light of shifts in Israeli politics and Palestinian politics; a rightward drift in Israeli politics; a weakening of President Abbas’s ability to move and take risks on behalf of peace in the Palestinian Territories; in light of all the dangers that have emerged in the region and the understandable fears that Israelis may have about the chaos and rise of groups like ISIL and the deterioration of Syria -- in light of all those things, what we at least wanted to do, understanding that the two parties wouldn’t actually arrive at a final status agreement, is to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution. Because we do not see an alternative to it. And I’ve said this directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu. I’ve said it inside of Israel. I’ve said it to Palestinians, as well. I don't see how this issues gets resolved in a way that maintains Israel as both Jewish and a democracy, because if you do not have two states, then in some form or fashion you are extending an occupation, functionally you end up having one state in which millions of people are disenfranchised and operate as second-class occupant -- residents. You can’t even call them citizens, necessarily. And so the goal of the resolution was to simply say that the settlements -- the growth of the settlements are creating a reality on the ground that increasingly will make a two-state solution impossible. And we believed, consistent with the position that had been taken with previous U.S. administrations for decades now, that it was important for us to send a signal, a wake-up call, that this moment may be passing, and Israeli voters and Palestinians need to understand that this moment may be passing. And hopefully that, then, creates a debate inside both Israeli and Palestinian communities that won’t result immediately in peace, but at least will lead to a more sober assessment of what the alternatives are. So the President-elect will have his own policy. The ambassador -- or the candidate for the ambassadorship obviously has very different views than I do. That is their prerogative. That’s part of what happens after elections. And I think my views are clear. We’ll see how their approach plays itself out. I don’t want to project today what could end up happening, but obviously it’s a volatile environment. What we’ve seen in the past is, when sudden, unilateral moves are made that speak to some of the core issues and sensitivities of either side, that can be explosive. And what we’ve tried to do in the transition is just to provide the context in which the President- elect may want to make some of these decisions. 1","Well, son, you've touched on some of the most enduring challenges in foreign policy, and particularly in that always-fraught region.

Let me be clear: the United States has long held that Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are an obstacle to peace. That's not a new position; it's been the consistent view of administrations, both Republican and Democrat, for decades. When such a resolution comes before the U.N. Security Council, it often reflects a broader international consensus, even if some of our closest allies might disagree on the timing or specifics. Criticism? Comes with the territory, son. When you're trying to navigate such a complex path, you're bound to make someone unhappy. But a President has to do what he believes is right for American interests and for the cause of peace.

Now, as for the more recent developments you've mentioned – the shift in policy regarding Jerusalem, the ambassadorial appointments, a questioning of the two-state solution – these are significant departures from the bedrock principles that have guided American foreign policy in the Middle East for a very long time.

My administration always believed, and I still do, that the United States cannot effectively lead in the Arab world, or anywhere else for that matter, if we aren't seen as a fair and consistent actor. When you abandon long-standing positions, when you appear to take sides so overtly, you risk losing the trust of both parties. That ""honest broker"" role isn't just a nice phrase; it's absolutely vital. Without it, our ability to mediate, to de-escalate, to push for compromise, it all diminishes, and that's a dangerous path.

Will it ignite a third intifada? I certainly hope not. The region is already a powder keg. But when hope for a political solution dwindles, and when one side feels cornered, the risk of violence absolutely increases. That's why consistent diplomacy and clear commitment to a viable peace process are so crucial.

And will this truly protect Israel? That's the billion-dollar question, isn't it? Our commitment to Israel's security has always been ironclad. But real, lasting security for Israel, in my view, has always been tied to a just and lasting peace with its neighbors, particularly the Palestinians. Unilateral actions, or policies that seem to abandon the prospects for a two-state solution, may provide short-term political wins, but they could well undermine Israel's long-term security and its democratic character. Peace, built on a foundation of mutual recognition and security, that's the greatest protector for all.

In retrospect, did I think we should have held Israel more accountable, like my administration did with the loan guarantees? Let me tell you about that. We were very clear then: our aid, our support, our backing, came with expectations. We tied those loan guarantees, crucial for Israel's absorption of Soviet immigrants, to a halt in settlement expansion. Why? Because we believed that continued settlement expansion actively undermined the peace process we were trying to build, especially heading into the Madrid Conference. It was a tough decision, yes, and I took a lot of heat for it. But it was about upholding American principles, maintaining our credibility as a mediator, and pushing both sides towards the difficult compromises necessary for peace. Sometimes, being a true friend means telling the truth, even when it's unwelcome. It means using the leverage you have to ensure that actions are consistent with the shared goal of regional stability.

The world needs American leadership, not just in might, but in moral clarity and steady diplomacy. When we falter in that, the consequences can be profound for everyone involved."
 Are you worried that this [inaudible] -- ,"Well, that’s part of what we’ve tried to indicate to the incoming team in our transition process, is pay attention to this, because this is volatile stuff. People feel deeply and passionately about this. And as I’ve said I think many times, the actions that we take have enormous consequences and ramifications. We’re the biggest kid on the block. And I think it is right and appropriate for a new President to test old assumptions and reexamine the old ways of doing things. But if you’re going to make big shifts in policy, just make sure you’ve thought it through, and understand that there are going to be consequences, and actions typically create reactions, and so you want to be intentional about it. You don’t want to do things off the cuff when it comes to an issue this volatile. Chris Johnson.","Well, I didn't quite catch the end of that question, son, these microphones can be a bit tricky sometimes. But let me tell you, when it comes to America and the American people, I'm not worried. We're the greatest country in the world, and we face every challenge head-on, with strength and determination. We always have, and we always will. Next question."
 On LGBT rights -- ,"I'm sorry, where is Chris?","Well, folks, when it comes to matters of LGBT rights, it's an issue that touches on deeply held beliefs and the very fabric of our society.

During my time in office, I was clear: I believe in the sanctity of marriage as a union between one man and one woman. It's a foundational institution, something that has been understood for millennia and is central to strong families and communities. We stood firm on that principle, believing it was essential to the well-being of our nation.

Now, having said that, I also believe, deeply, that every single American, regardless of their background, their choices, or their walk of life, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. We're a compassionate country, and we ought to treat our neighbors as we'd like to be treated ourselves. We can have robust debates about important issues and still remember that we are all God's children, and we share a common humanity.

So, while we upheld the traditional definition of marriage, we also emphasized the importance of treating all individuals with respect and ensuring they are afforded the protections and liberties that are due to every citizen of this great land."
 I'm right here in the back. ,"I'm sorry, didn’t see you.","Alright, I see you back there! Don't be bashful now, we're all friends here. Good to hear a voice from the back of the room. What's on your mind?"
" On LGBT rights, we've seen a lot of achievements over the past eight years, including signing hate crimes protection legislation, ""don’t ask, don’t tell"" repeal, marriage equality nationwide, and ensuring transgender people feel visible and accepted. How do you think LGBT rights will rank in terms of your accomplishments and your legacy? And how confident are you that progress will endure or continue under the President-elect? ","I could not be prouder of the transformation that's taken place in our society just in the last decade. And I've said before, I think we made some useful contributions to it, but the primary heroes in this stage of our growth as a democracy and a society are all the individual activists, and sons and daughters and couples who courageously said, this is who I am and I'm proud of it. 2 And that opened people's minds and opened their hearts. And, eventually, laws caught up. But I don’t think any of that would have happened without the activism -- in some cases, loud and noisy, but in some cases, just quiet and very personal. And I think that what we did as an administration was to help the society to move in a better direction, but to do so in a way that didn’t create an enormous backlash, and was systematic and respectful of the fact that, in some cases, these issues were controversial. I think the way we handled, for example, ""don’t ask, don’t tell"" -- being methodical about it, working with the Joint Chiefs, making sure that we showed this would not have an impact on the effectiveness of the greatest military on Earth -- and then to have Defense Secretary Bob Gates and Chairman Mike Mullen and a Joint Chiefs who were open to evidence and ultimately worked with me to do the right thing -- I am proud of that. But, again, none of that would have happened without this incredible transformation that was happening in society out there. You know, when I gave Ellen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, I meant what I said. I think somebody that kind and likeable projecting into living rooms around the country -- that changed attitudes. And that wasn’t easy to do for her. And that's just one small example of what was happening in countless communities all across the country. So I’m proud that in certain places we maybe provided a good block downfield to help the movement advance. I don't think it is something that will be reversible because American society has changed; the attitudes of young people, in particular, have changed. That doesn't mean there aren’t going to be some fights that are important -- legal issues, issues surrounding transgender persons - - there are still going to be some battles that need to take place. But if you talk to young people of Malia, Sasha’s generation, even if they’re Republicans, even if they're conservative, many of them would tell you, I don't understand how you would discriminate against somebody because of sexual orientation. That's just sort of burned into them in pretty powerful ways. April Ryan. 3","Well, look, when I was in office, my focus was always on ensuring every American had a chance to achieve the American dream, to be treated with respect, and to live in a secure nation. We had big challenges, whether it was defending our country after 9/11, or making sure our economy was strong, or getting good education into every child's hands.

Now, you're talking about a lot of developments that have happened in the years since I left the Oval Office, achievements under different administrations, and, you know, the courts have weighed in on some of these matters as well. My administration always believed in a culture of respect, in treating all our citizens with dignity, and in upholding the rule of law. We signed into law measures that protected individuals from discrimination and violence, and we always stood up for freedom.

As for my legacy, I'll let history judge that. My job was to make decisions based on my conscience, on the Constitution, and on what I believed was best for the country at the time.

Regarding the future, look, America is a strong country. We've always moved forward. Every President faces their own challenges, and every President has to uphold the Constitution. I have faith in the American people, and I have faith in our institutions. The President-elect will have a lot on their plate, and I'm sure they'll lead with the best interests of the country at heart, as every President tries to do. We're a nation of laws, and we're a nation of values, and I believe those will continue to guide us."
" Thank you, Mr. President. Long before today you’ve been considered a rights President. Under your watch, people have said that you have expanded the rubber band of inclusion. And with the election and the incoming administration, people are saying that rubber band has recoiled and maybe is even broken. And I’m taking you back to a time on Air Force One going to Selma, Alabama, when you said your job was to close the gaps that remain. And with that, what gaps still remain when it comes to rights issues on the table? And also what part will you play in fixing those gaps after -- in your new life? And lastly, you are the first black President. Do you expect this country to see this again? ","Well, I’ll answer the last question first. I think we're going to see people of merit rise up from every race, faith, corner of this country, because that's America’s strength. When we have everybody getting a chance and everybody is on the field, we end up being better. I think I’ve used this analogy before. We killed it in the Olympics in Brazil. And Michelle and I, we always have our -- the Olympic team here. And it’s a lot of fun, first of all, just because anytime you're meeting somebody who is the best at anything, it’s impressive. And these mostly very young people are all just so healthy-looking, and they just beam and exude fitness and health. And so we have a great time talking to them. But they are of all shapes, sizes, colors -- the genetic diversity that is on display is remarkable. And if you look at a Simone Biles, and then you look at a Michael Phelps, they're completely different. And it's precisely because of those differences that we've got people here who can excel at any sport. And, by the way, more than half of our medals came from women. And the reason is, is because we had the foresight several decades ago, with something called Title 9, to make sure that women got opportunities in sports, which is why our women compete better -- because they have more opportunities than folks in other countries. So I use that as a metaphor. And if, in fact, we continue to keep opportunity open to everybody, then, yes, we're going to have a woman President, we're going to have a Latino President, and we'll have a Jewish President, a Hindu President. 4 Who knows who we're going to have? I suspect we'll have a whole bunch of mixed-up Presidents at some point that nobody really knows what to call them. And that's fine. But what do I worry about? I obviously spent a lot of time on this, April, at my farewell address on Tuesday, so I won't go through the whole list. I worry about inequality, because I think that if we are not investing in making sure everybody plays a role in this economy, the economy will not grow as fast, and I think it will also lead to further and further separation between us as Americans -- not just along racial lines. There are a whole bunch of folks who voted for the President-elect because they feel forgotten and disenfranchised. They feel as if they're being looked down on. They feel as if their kids aren't going to have the same opportunities as they did. And you don't want to have an America in which a very small sliver of people are doing really well and everybody else is fighting for scraps, as I said last week. Because that's oftentimes when racial divisions get magnified, because people think, well, the only way I'm going to get ahead is if I make sure somebody else gets less, somebody who doesn't look like me or doesn't worship at the same place I do. That's not a good recipe for our democracy. I worry about, as I said in response to a previous question, making sure that the basic machinery of our democracy works better. We are the only country in the advanced world that makes it harder to vote rather than easier. And that dates back -- there's an ugly history to that that we should not be shy about talking about.","Well, thank you for that question. It's good to be here, and it’s always humbling to reflect on the journey we’ve taken together as a nation.

You know, when I spoke on Air Force One heading to Selma, my message was about the unfinished work of our democracy. And while we certainly made progress, while that ""rubber band of inclusion"" stretched in ways many thought impossible, the truth is, the gaps don’t magically disappear simply because we’ve achieved significant milestones.

What gaps remain? They are, in many ways, the same gaps that have always challenged us, just sometimes appearing in new forms. We still see **economic inequality** that too often correlates with race, ethnicity, and zip code, preventing folks from accessing the same opportunities. We have persistent challenges in **our criminal justice system**, where systemic biases continue to disproportionately affect communities of color. While we enshrined marriage equality into law, we still have to ensure **full and equal treatment** under the law for all LGBTQ+ Americans, and guard against discrimination. And let's not forget **voting rights** – the very bedrock of our democracy – which constantly needs protection and expansion, not contraction. We must always strive for a nation where every voice can be heard, and every vote counted. And underlying all of this, of course, is the work of bridging divides, combating misinformation, and ensuring that our institutions truly reflect the diversity and aspirations of all Americans.

As for my part in this ""new life,"" as you call it, it is, in many ways, a continuation of that work, just from a different vantage point. My focus, through the Obama Foundation and other efforts, is on **empowering the next generation of leaders**. It's about inspiring young people, giving them the tools and the platforms to drive change in their own communities and around the world. It’s about defending democratic norms, promoting civic engagement, and reminding people that progress is not inevitable; it requires constant tending, hard work, and good faith engagement from all of us. I won't be writing legislation, but I will continue to speak out, to organize, and to invest in the leaders who will.

And will this country see another Black President? You know, when I first ran, there were many who said it couldn't be done, and then there were many more who said it wouldn't happen again. But I firmly believe that this country is capable of great things. My election wasn't just about me; it was about the American people choosing to believe in a better future, in a more inclusive vision for our country. So, yes, I absolutely do expect this country to see another Black President, and another woman President, and another President from every walk of life that reflects the beautiful diversity of this nation. It won’t be easy, and it won't be handed to us. It will require continued effort, breaking down barriers, and nurturing the kind of civic discourse and engagement that makes such milestones possible. But I have an abiding faith in the American people and the ongoing journey of our democracy. We keep moving forward."
 Voting rights? ,"Yes, I'm talking about voting rights. The reason that we are the only country among advanced democracies that makes it harder to vote is it traces directly back to Jim Crow and the legacy of slavery. And it became sort of acceptable to restrict the franchise. And that's not who we are. That shouldn't be who we are. That's not when America works best. So I hope that people pay a lot of attention to making sure that everybody has a chance to vote. Make it easier, not harder. This whole notion of election -- of voting fraud, this is something that has constantly been disproved. This is fake news -- the notion that there are a whole bunch of people out there who are going out there and are not eligible to vote and 5 want to vote. We have the opposite problem. We have a whole bunch of people who are eligible to vote who don't vote. And so the idea that we'd put in place a whole bunch of barriers to people voting doesn't make sense. And then, as I've said before, political gerrymandering that makes your vote matter less because politicians have decided you live in a district where everybody votes the same way you do so that these aren't competitive races, and we get 90 percent Democratic districts, 90 percent Republican districts -- that's bad for our democracy, too. I worry about that. I think it is very important for us to make sure that our criminal justice system is fair and just. But I also think it's also very important to make sure that it is not politicized, that it maintains an integrity that is outside of partisan politics at every level. I think at some point we’re going to have to spend -- and this will require some action by the Supreme Court -- we have to reexamine just the flood of endless money that goes into our politics, which I think is very unhealthy. So there are a whole bunch of things I worry about there. And as I said in my speech on Tuesday, we got more work to do on race. It is not -- it is simply not true that things have gotten worse. They haven’t. Things are getting better. And I have more confidence on racial issues in the next generation than I do in our generation or the previous generation. I think kids are smarter about it. They’re more tolerant. They are more inclusive by instinct than we are. And hopefully my presidency maybe helped that along a little bit. But, you know, we -- when we feel stress, when we feel pressure, when we’re just fed information that encourages some of our worst instincts, we tend to fall back into some of the old racial fears and racial divisions and racial stereotypes. And it’s very hard for us to break out of those, and to listen, and to think about people as people, and to imagine being in that person’s shoes. And by the way, it’s no longer a black and white issue alone. You got Hispanic folks, and you got Asian folks, and this is not just the same old battles. We’ve got this stew that’s bubbling up of people from everywhere. And we’re going to have to make sure that we, in our own lives, in our own families and workplaces, do a better job of treating everybody with basic respect. 6 And understanding that not everybody starts off in the same situation, and imagining what would it be like if you were born in an inner city and had no job prospects anywhere within a 20-mile radius, or how does it feel being born in some rural county where there’s no job opportunities in a 20-mile radius -- and seeing those two things as connected as opposed to separate. So we got work to do. But, overall, I think on this front, the trend lines ultimately, I think, will be good. Christi Parsons. And Christi, you are going to get the last question.","Well, now, voting rights are absolutely fundamental to our democracy, plain and simple. Every single eligible American citizen has the sacred right to cast their ballot and have their voice heard. That's a cornerstone of this great nation.

But with that right comes a solemn responsibility, too. We've got to ensure the integrity and security of every election. Folks need to have confidence that their vote counts, that it's protected from fraud, and that only eligible citizens are voting. It's about making sure the process is fair, transparent, and that the results truly reflect the will of the people.

The states, of course, have a vital role in administering our elections, and we need to empower them to uphold these standards, ensuring both broad access for eligible voters and the security of the ballot box. It's a balance, but one we must always strive to get right."
" Oh, no. ","Christi is -- I’ve been knowing her since Springfield, Illinois. When I was a state senator, she listened to what I had to say. So the least I can do is give her the last question as President of the United States. Go on.","Well, now, look, folks, we gotta understand what's causin' that ""Oh, no."" We can't let a little ""Oh, no"" deter us from stayin' the course. We're strong, we're resilient, and we'll face whatever challenge comes our way, head-on. That's the American spirit."
 217 numbers still work. ,There you go. Go ahead.,"Well, that's certainly good to hear! You always want to know the numbers are working, right? It means the systems are holding up, things are on track, and that's exactly what we strive for in this country – efficiency, reliability, getting the job done.

What particular numbers are you looking at there? We've got a lot of things running smoothly these days, and we aim to keep it that way for the American people."
" Well, thank you, Mr. President. It has been an honor. ",Thank you.,"Well, thank you. The honor was truly ours. I appreciate your time and your insights today. God bless, and you take care now."
