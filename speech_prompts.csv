"Can you provide a brief overview of the Iran nuclear deal and its implications for US national security and the global community, suitable for a public address to the American people and Congress?
","15 July, White House, Washington, D.C. Good afternoon, everybody. Yesterday was a historic day. The comprehensive, long-term deal that we achieved with our allies and partners to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon represents a powerful display of American leadership and diplomacy. It shows what we can accomplish when we lead from a position of strength and a position of principle, when we unite the international community around a shared vision, and we resolve to solve problems peacefully. As I said yesterday, it’s important for the American people and Congress to get a full opportunity to review this deal. That process is now underway. I’ve already reached out to leaders in Congress on both sides of the aisle. My national security team has begun offering extensive briefings. I expect the debate to be robust -- and that’s how it should be. This is an important issue. Our national security policies are stronger and more effective when they are subject to the scrutiny and transparency that democracy demands. And as I said yesterday, the details of this deal matter very much. That’s why our team worked so hard for so long to get the details right. At the same time, as this debate unfolds, I hope we don’t lose sight of the larger picture -- the opportunity that this agreement represents. As we go forward, it’s important for everybody to remember the alternative and the fundamental choice that this moment represents. With this deal, we cut off every single one of Iran’s pathways to a nuclear program -- a nuclear weapons program, and Iran’s nuclear program will be under severe limits for many years. Without a deal, those pathways remain open; there would be no limits on Iran’s nuclear program, and Iran could move closer to a nuclear bomb. With this deal, we gain unprecedented, around-the-clock monitoring of Iran’s key nuclear facilities and the most comprehensive and intrusive inspection and verification regime ever negotiated. Without a deal, those inspections go away, and we lose the ability to closely monitor Iran’s program and detect any covert nuclear weapons program. With this deal, if Iran violates its commitments, there will be real consequences. Nuclear- related sanctions that have helped to cripple the Iranian economy will snap back into place. Without a deal, the international sanctions regime will unravel, with little ability to re-impose them. With this deal, we have the possibility of peacefully resolving a major threat to regional and international security. Without a deal, we risk even more war in the Middle East, and other countries in the region would feel compelled to pursue their own nuclear programs, threatening a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world. As I said yesterday, even with this deal, we will continue to have profound differences with Iran -- its support for terrorism and its use of proxies to destabilize parts of the Middle East. Therefore, the multilateral arms embargo on Iran will remain in place for an additional five years, and restrictions on ballistic missile technology will remain for eight years. In addition, the United States will maintain our own sanctions related to Iran’s support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, and its human rights violations. And we’ll continue our unprecedented security cooperation with Israel and continue to deepen our partnerships with the Gulf States. But the bottom line is this: This nuclear deal meets the national security interests of the United States and our allies. It prevents the most serious threat -- Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, which would only make the other problems that Iran may cause even worse. That’s why this deal makes our country, and the world, safer and more secure. It’s why the alternative -- no limits on Iran’s nuclear program, no inspections, an Iran that’s closer to a nuclear weapon, the risk of a regional nuclear arms race and a greater risk of war -- all that would endanger our security. That’s the choice that we face. If we don’t choose wisely, I believe future generations will judge us harshly for letting this moment slip away. And no one suggests that this deal resolves all the threats that Iran poses to its neighbors or the world. Moreover, realizing the promise of this deal will require many years of implementation and hard work. It will require vigilance and execution. But this deal is our best means of assuring that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. And, from the start, that has been my number-one priority, our number-one priority. We’ve got a historic chance to pursue a safer and more secure world -- an opportunity that may not come again in our lifetimes. As President and as Commander-in-Chief, I am determined to seize that opportunity. So with that, I’m going to take some questions. And let me see who I’m starting off with. Here you go. I got it. Andrew Beatty, AFP. Question: Nothing different -- President Obama: No. Look, I'm always hopeful that behavior may change for the sake of the Iranian people as well as people in the region. There are young people there who are not getting the opportunities they deserve because of conflict, because of sectarianism, because of poor governance, because of repression, because of terrorism. And I remain eternally hopeful that we can do something about that, and it should be part of U.S. foreign policy to do something about that. But I'm not banking on that to say that this deal is the right thing to do. Again, it is incumbent on the critics of this deal to explain how an American President is in a worse position 12, 13, 14, 15 years from now if, in fact, at that point Iran says we’re going to pull out of the NPT, kick out inspectors and go for a nuclear bomb. If that happens, that President will be in a better position than what happened if Iran, as a consequence of Congress rejecting this deal, decides that’s it, we’re done negotiating, we’re going after a bomb right now. The choices would be tougher today than they would be for that President 15 years from now. And I have not yet heard logic that refutes that. All right. I really have to go now. I think we’ve hit the big themes. But I promise you, I will address this again. All right? I suspect this is not the last that we’ve heard of this debate. 8 Kenyan Civil Society Members Conversation","Alright folks, let's talk about this Iran nuclear deal, this JCPOA. Now, I know a lot of you have heard different things, some good, some not so good. Let me tell you where I stand.

This deal, as it was structured, was deeply flawed. It was supposed to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, right? That's the goal. But instead, it just kicked the can down the road! It gave them billions of dollars, money they could use to fund their destabilizing activities all across the Middle East. Terrorist groups, you name it. 

And the inspections? Well, let's just say they weren't nearly as rigorous as they should have been. Trusting Iran to police themselves? That’s like trusting a fox to guard the henhouse!

My administration believed that the deal was a disaster for American national security and for our allies, especially Israel. It didn't address Iran's ballistic missile program, it didn't address their support for terrorism, and the sunset clauses meant that after a few years, they could just waltz right into building a nuclear weapon. 

Pulling out of the deal was a tough decision, but it was the right decision. We needed to send a clear message to Iran that we wouldn't tolerate their pursuit of nuclear weapons and their malign behavior. We reimposed sanctions, and we made it clear that we would hold them accountable.

Now, some folks say that pulling out of the deal made us more isolated. But I say, standing up for what's right is never being isolated. America is a strong country, and we need to lead the world in confronting these threats. The world is more dangerous with a nuclear Iran, and we gotta do everything we can to prevent that from happening. That is my solemn duty as President.

Thank you, and God bless America.

"Can you provide a speech about the current situation in Iraq, specifically addressing the airstrikes and humanitarian efforts to protect American personnel and Iraqi civilians? Explain the reasoning behind these actions to the American people.
","Good evening. Today I authorized two operations in Iraq -- targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water and facing almost certain death. Let me explain the actions we’re taking and why. First, I said in June -- as the terrorist group ISIL began an advance across Iraq -- that the United States would be prepared to take targeted military action in Iraq if and when we determined that the situation required it. In recent days, these terrorists have continued to move across Iraq, and have neared the city of Erbil, where American diplomats and civilians serve at our consulate and American military personnel advise Iraqi forces. To stop the advance on Erbil, I’ve directed our military to take targeted strikes against ISIL terrorist convoys should they move toward the city. We intend to stay vigilant, and take action if these terrorist forces threaten our personnel or facilities anywhere in Iraq, including our consulate in Erbil and our embassy in Baghdad. We’re also providing urgent assistance to Iraqi government and Kurdish forces so they can more effectively wage the fight against ISIL. Second, at the request of the Iraqi government -- we’ve begun operations to help save Iraqi civilians stranded on the mountain. 1 As ISIL has marched across Iraq, it has waged a ruthless campaign against innocent Iraqis. And these terrorists have been especially barbaric towards religious minorities, including Christian and Yezidis, a small and ancient religious sect. Countless Iraqis have been displaced. And chilling reports describe ISIL militants rounding up families, conducting mass executions, and enslaving Yezidi women. In recent days, Yezidi women, men and children from the area of Sinjar have fled for their lives. And thousands -- perhaps tens of thousands -- are now hiding high up on the mountain, with little but the clothes on their backs. They’re without food, they’re without water. People are starving. And children are dying of thirst. Meanwhile, ISIL forces below have called for the systematic destruction of the entire Yezidi people, which would constitute genocide. So these innocent families are faced with a horrible choice: descend the mountain and be slaughtered, or stay and slowly die of thirst and hunger. I’ve said before, the United States cannot and should not intervene every time there’s a crisis in the world. So let me be clear about why we must act, and act now. When we face a situation like we do on that mountain -- with innocent people facing the prospect of violence on a horrific scale, when we have a mandate to help -- in this case, a request from the Iraqi government -- and when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a blind eye. We can act, carefully and responsibly, to prevent a potential act of genocide. That’s what we’re doing on that mountain. I’ve, therefore, authorized targeted airstrikes, if necessary, to help forces in Iraq as they fight to break the siege of Mount Sinjar and protect the civilians trapped there. Already, American aircraft have begun conducting humanitarian airdrops of food and water to help these desperate men, women and children survive. Earlier this week, one Iraqi in the area cried to the world, ""There is no one coming to help."" Well today, America is coming to help. We’re also consulting with other countries -- and the United Nations -- who have called for action to address this humanitarian crisis. I know that many of you are rightly concerned about any American military action in Iraq, even limited strikes like these. I understand that. I ran for this office in part to end our war in Iraq and welcome our troops home, and that’s what we’ve done. As Commander-in-Chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq. And so even as we support Iraqis as they take the fight to these terrorists, American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq, because there’s no American military solution to the larger crisis in Iraq. The only lasting solution is reconciliation among Iraqi communities and stronger Iraqi security forces. However, we can and should support moderate forces who can bring stability to Iraq. So even as we carry out these two missions, we will continue to pursue a broader strategy that empowers Iraqis to confront this crisis. Iraqi leaders need to come together and forge a new government that represents the legitimate interests of all Iraqis, and that can fight back against the threats like ISIL. Iraqis have named a new President, a new Speaker of Parliament, and are seeking consensus on a new Prime Minister. This is the progress that needs to continue in order to reverse the momentum of the terrorists who prey on Iraq’s divisions. Once Iraq has a new government, the United States will work with it and other countries in the region to provide increased support to deal with this humanitarian crisis and counterterrorism challenge. None of Iraq’s neighbors have an interest in this terrible suffering or instability. And so we’ll continue to work with our friends and allies to help refugees get the shelter and food and water they so desperately need, and to help Iraqis push back against ISIL. The several hundred American advisors that I ordered to Iraq will continue to assess what more we can do to help train, advise and support Iraqi forces going forward. And just as I consulted Congress on the decisions I made today, we will continue to do so going forward. My fellow Americans, the world is confronted by many challenges. And while America has never been able to right every wrong, America has made the world a more secure and prosperous place. And our leadership is necessary to underwrite the global security and prosperity that our children and our grandchildren will depend upon. We do so by adhering to a set of core principles. We do whatever is necessary to protect our people. We support our allies when they’re in danger. We lead coalitions of countries to uphold international norms. And we strive to stay true to the fundamental values -- the desire to live with basic freedom and dignity -- that is common to human beings wherever they are. That’s why people all over the world look to the United States of America to lead. And that’s why we do it. So let me close by assuring you that there is no decision that I take more seriously than the use of military force. Over the last several years, we have brought the vast majority of our troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan. And I’ve been careful to resist calls to turn time and again to our military, because America has other tools in our arsenal than our military. We can also lead with the power of our diplomacy, our economy, and our ideals. But when the lives of American citizens are at risk, we will take action. That’s my responsibility as Commander-in-Chief. And when many thousands of innocent civilians are faced with the danger of being wiped out, and we have the capacity to do something about it, we will take action. That is our responsibility as Americans. That’s a hallmark of American leadership. That’s who we are. So tonight, we give thanks to our men and women in uniform -— especially our brave pilots and crews over Iraq who are protecting our fellow Americans and saving the lives of so many men, women and children that they will never meet. They represent American leadership at its best. As a nation, we should be proud of them, and of our country’s enduring commitment to uphold our own security and the dignity of our fellow human beings. God bless our Armed Forces, and God bless the United States of America. 1 Reference is to Sinjar or Shengal Mountain, which is, or is part of, a mountainous ridge located near the Yezidi Kurdish city of Sinjar in Nineveh province, Northwestern Iraq. First Update On Authorizing Targeted Air Strikes and Humanitarian Aid in Iraq","(Clears throat, adjusts tie, a slight Texas drawl coloring my voice)

My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak to you plainly about the situation in Iraq. We all remember the sacrifices made, the battles fought, and the hopes invested in a stable and secure Iraq. That hope, while still flickering, is being threatened by forces of chaos and extremism.

Now, I know many of you are asking yourselves, ""Why Iraq, again?"" And that's a fair question, a necessary question. The answer, as always, comes down to two fundamental principles: protecting American lives and upholding our commitment to a world where freedom can take root and flourish.

First, let's talk about our personnel. We have brave men and women – diplomats, trainers, advisors – on the ground in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government, working to help them build a more secure and self-reliant nation. We cannot and will not stand idly by while these Americans are threatened by terrorist groups. The airstrikes you've been hearing about? They are a direct and proportionate response to those threats. They are targeted, precise, and designed to degrade the capabilities of those who would do harm to our people.

But this isn't just about protecting Americans. It's about the Iraqi people. These extremist groups, these terrorists, they don't care about democracy, they don't care about human rights, they don't care about the future of Iraq. They only care about power, and they are willing to slaughter innocent men, women, and children to achieve it. We cannot abandon the Iraqi people to this barbarity.

That's why, alongside the necessary military action, we are also intensifying our humanitarian efforts. We are working with international organizations to provide food, water, and medical assistance to the Iraqi people who have been displaced and affected by this violence. We are committed to helping them rebuild their lives and secure a more stable future.

Now, let me be clear: this is not another full-scale invasion. This is a targeted and limited operation with clear objectives. We are not looking to re-occupy Iraq. We are working in partnership with the Iraqi government and with our allies in the region to help them defeat these extremists and stabilize their own country.

This is a long and challenging road. There will be setbacks. There will be difficult decisions to be made. But I am confident that, by staying true to our principles, by working together with our allies, and by supporting the Iraqi people in their fight for a better future, we can ultimately prevail. God bless America, and God bless the Iraqi people.

"Can you provide a speech about job creation and deficit reduction, addressing the American people and Congress? Highlight the need for bipartisan cooperation and a balanced approach involving spending cuts and revenue.
","Thank you. Well, good afternoon, everybody. Now that those of us on the campaign trail have had a chance to get a little sleep -- it’s time to get back to work. And there is plenty of work to do. As I said on Tuesday night, the American people voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in that spirit, I’ve invited leaders of both parties to the White House next week, so we can start to build consensus around the challenges that we can only solve together. And I also intend to bring in business and labor and civic leaders from all across the country here to Washington to get their ideas and input as well. At a time when our economy is still recovering from the Great Recession, our top priority has to be jobs and growth. That’s the focus of the plan I talked about during the campaign. It’s a plan to reward small businesses and manufacturers that create jobs here, not overseas. It’s a plan to give people the chance to get the education and training that businesses are looking for right now. It’s a plan to make sure this country is a global leader in research and technology and clean energy, which will attract new companies and high-wage jobs to America. It’s a plan to put folks back to work, including our veterans, rebuilding our roads and our bridges, and other infrastructure. And it’s a plan to reduce our deficit in a balanced and responsible way. Our work is made that much more urgent because at the end of this year, we face a series of deadlines that require us to make major decisions about how to pay our deficit down -- decisions that will have a huge impact on the economy and the middle class, both now and in the future. Last year, I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars’ worth of spending that we just couldn’t afford. I intend to work with both parties to do more -- and that includes making reforms that will bring down the cost of health care so we can strengthen programs like Medicaid and Medicare for the long haul. But as I’ve said before, we can’t just cut our way to prosperity. If we’re serious about reducing the deficit, we have to combine spending cuts with revenue -- and that means asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes. That’s how we did it -- That's how we did it in the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was President. That’s how we can reduce the deficit while still making the investments we need to build a strong middle class and a strong economy. That’s the only way we can still afford to train our workers, or help our kids pay for college, or make sure that good jobs in clean energy or high-tech manufacturing don’t end up in countries like China. Now, already, I’ve put forward a detailed plan that allows us to make these investments while reducing our deficit by 4 trillion dollars over the next decade. I want to be clear -- I’m not wedded to every detail of my plan. I’m open to compromise. I’m open to new ideas. I’m committed to solving our fiscal challenges. But I refuse to accept any approach that isn’t balanced. I am not going to ask students and seniors and middle-class families to pay down the entire deficit while people like me, making over 250,000, dollars aren’t asked to pay a dime more in taxes. I'm not going to do that. And I just want to point out this was a central question during the election. It was debated over and over again. And on Tuesday night, we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach -- and that includes Democrats, independents, and a lot of Republicans across the country, as well as independent economists and budget experts. That’s how you reduce the deficit -- with a balanced approach. So our job now is to get a majority in Congress to reflect the will of the American people. And I believe we can get that majority. I was encouraged to hear Speaker Boehner agree that tax revenue has to be part of this equation -- so I look forward to hearing his ideas when I see him next week. And let me make one final point that every American needs to hear. Right now, if Congress fails to come to an agreement on an overall deficit reduction package by the end of the year, everybody’s taxes will automatically go up on January 1st -- everybody’s -- including the 98 percent of Americans who make less than 250,000 dollars a year. And that makes no sense. It would be bad for the economy and would hit families that are already struggling to make ends meet. Now, fortunately, we shouldn’t need long negotiations or drama to solve that part of the problem. While there may be disagreement in Congress over whether or not to raise taxes on folks making over 250,000 dollars a year, nobody -- not Republicans, not Democrats -- want taxes to go up for folks making under 250,000 dollars a year. So let’s not wait. Even as we’re negotiating a broader deficit reduction package, let’s extend the middle-class tax cuts right now. Let's do that right now. That one step -- that one step -- would give millions of families -- 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses -- the certainty that they need going into the new year. It would immediately take a huge chunk of the economic uncertainty off the table, and that will lead to new jobs and faster growth. Business will know that consumers, they're not going to see a big tax increase. They'll know that most small businesses won't see a tax increase. And so a lot of the uncertainty that you're reading about, that will be removed. In fact, the Senate has already passed a bill doing exactly this, so all we need is action from the House. And I’ve got the pen ready to sign the bill right away. I'm ready to do it. I'm ready to do it. The American people understand that we’re going to have differences and disagreements in the months to come. They get that. But on Tuesday, they said loud and clear that they won’t tolerate dysfunction. They won’t tolerate politicians who view compromise as a dirty word. Not when so many Americans are still out of work. Not when so many families and small business owners are still struggling to pay the bills. What the American people are looking for is cooperation. They're looking for consensus. They're looking for common sense. Most of all, they want action. I intend to deliver for them in my second term, and I expect to find willing partners in both parties to make that happen. So let’s get to work. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. First Press Conference Following Presidential Reelection","Alright folks, let me talk to you about something near and dear to all our hearts: jobs and keeping this great nation of ours fiscally sound. You know, it's like I always say, you gotta keep the car running smooth *and* keep the tank full, right? 

First off, to the American people – I know you're working hard. You're juggling family, careers, and trying to make ends meet. You deserve an economy that works *for* you, not against you. And that means good, solid jobs that pay a decent wage. We need to unleash the power of American ingenuity! Cut the red tape, get the government out of the way of small businesses, and let entrepreneurs do what they do best: create jobs!

Now, to my friends in Congress, on both sides of the aisle – and let's be honest, sometimes it feels like you're on different planets, right? – we gotta be serious about this deficit. It’s like a credit card bill that keeps piling up. We can't just keep kicking the can down the road. It’s time for some adult conversations around the kitchen table.

Here's the plain truth: there’s no magic wand. We can't just cut our way to prosperity, and we can't just tax our way there either. We need a balanced approach. It's like a seesaw – gotta keep it even.

On the spending side, we need to be honest about where we can cut. Wasteful spending, programs that aren't working... we gotta tighten our belts. But we also have to be smart about it. Investing in education, infrastructure, and things that make us stronger in the long run – that's not just spending, that's investing in our future.

And on the revenue side, let’s be real. We gotta make sure everyone's paying their fair share. We can't have loopholes that let some people get away without paying their taxes. A simpler, fairer tax code is better for everyone. Maybe we could all learn to listen to each other and be a little more compassionate and understanding.

This isn't about Democrats or Republicans; this is about America. We gotta work together, find common ground, and put the interests of the American people first. I believe in the American spirit, I believe in our ability to overcome challenges. Let's roll up our sleeves, get to work, and build a stronger, more prosperous America for generations to come. Thank you, and God bless America.

"Can you provide an update on the success of the Paris Agreement on climate change to the American people?
","Good evening. In my first Inaugural Address, I committed this country to the tireless task of combating climate change and protecting this planet for future generations. Two weeks ago, in Paris, I said before the world that we needed a strong global agreement to accomplish this goal -- an enduring agreement that reduces global carbon pollution and sets the world on a course to a low-carbon future. A few hours ago, we succeeded. We came together around the strong agreement the world needed. We met the moment. I want to commend President Hollande and Secretary General Ban for their leadership and for hosting such a successful summit, and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius for presiding with patience and resolve. And I want to give a special thanks to Secretary John Kerry, my Senior Advisor Brian Deese, our chief negotiator Todd Stern, and everyone on their teams for their outstanding work and for making America proud. I also want to thank the people of nearly 200 nations -- large and small, developed and developing -- for working together to confront a threat to the people of all nations. Together, we’ve shown what’s possible when the world stands as one. Today, the American people can be proud -- because this historic agreement is a tribute to American leadership. Over the past seven years, we’ve transformed the United States into the global leader in fighting climate change. In 2009, we helped salvage a chaotic Copenhagen Summit and established the principle that all countries had a role to play in combating climate change. We then led by example, with historic investments in growing industries like wind and solar, creating a new and steady stream of middle-class jobs. We’ve set the first-ever nationwide standards to limit the amount of carbon pollution power plants can dump into the air our children breathe. From Alaska to the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains, we’ve partnered with local leaders who are working to help their communities protect themselves from some of the most immediate impacts of a changing climate. Now, skeptics said these actions would kill jobs. Instead, we’ve seen the longest streak of private-sector job creation in our history. We’ve driven our economic output to all-time highs while driving our carbon pollution down to its lowest level in nearly two decades. And then, with our historic joint announcement with China last year, we showed it was possible to bridge the old divides between developed and developing nations that had stymied global progress for so long. That accomplishment encouraged dozens and dozens of other nations to set their own ambitious climate targets. And that was the foundation for success in Paris. Because no nation, not even one as powerful as ours, can solve this challenge alone. And no country, no matter how small, can sit on the sidelines. All of us had to solve it together. Now, no agreement is perfect, including this one. Negotiations that involve nearly 200 nations are always challenging. Even if all the initial targets set in Paris are met, we’ll only be part of the way there when it comes to reducing carbon from the atmosphere. So we cannot be complacent because of today’s agreement. The problem is not solved because of this accord. But make no mistake, the Paris agreement establishes the enduring framework the world needs to solve the climate crisis. It creates the mechanism, the architecture, for us to continually tackle this problem in an effective way. This agreement is ambitious, with every nation setting and committing to their own specific targets, even as we take into account differences among nations. We’ll have a strong system of transparency, including periodic reviews and independent assessments, to help hold every country accountable for meeting its commitments. As technology advances, this agreement allows progress to pave the way for even more ambitious targets over time. And we have secured a broader commitment to support the most vulnerable countries as they pursue cleaner economic growth. In short, this agreement will mean less of the carbon pollution that threatens our planet, and more of the jobs and economic growth driven by low-carbon investment. Full implementation of this agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change, and will pave the way for even more progress, in successive stages, over the coming years. Moreover, this agreement sends a powerful signal that the world is firmly committed to a low- carbon future. And that has the potential to unleash investment and innovation in clean energy at a scale we have never seen before. The targets we’ve set are bold. And by empowering businesses, scientists, engineers, workers, and the private sector -- investors -- to work together, this agreement represents the best chance we’ve had to save the one planet that we’ve got. So I believe this moment can be a turning point for the world. We’ve shown that the world has both the will and the ability to take on this challenge. It won’t be easy. Progress won’t always come quick. We cannot be complacent. While our generation will see some of the benefits of building a clean energy economy -- jobs created and money saved -- we may not live to see the full realization of our achievement. But that’s okay. What matters is that today we can be more confident that this planet is going to be in better shape for the next generation. And that’s what I care about. I imagine taking my grandkids, if I’m lucky enough to have some, to the park someday, and holding their hands, and hearing their laughter, and watching a quiet sunset, all the while knowing that our work today prevented an alternate future that could have been grim; that our work, here and now, gave future generations cleaner air, and cleaner water, and a more sustainable planet. And what could be more important than that? Today, thanks to strong, principled, American leadership, that’s the world that we’ll leave to our children -- a world that is safer and more secure, more prosperous, and more free. And that is our most important mission in our short time here on this Earth. Thanks. Update on Military Campaign Against ISIL","Well now, folks, let's talk about this Paris Agreement. You know, I've always said America needs to be at the forefront, a leader on the world stage. And that includes the environment. Nobody wants dirty air or polluted water, not Republicans, not Democrats. 

Now, this Paris Agreement... Look, it was a start. I give 'em credit for gettin' folks talkin'. But let's be clear, it was a deeply flawed agreement. It put American businesses at a disadvantage. We were gonna be shackled by regulations while other countries, well, they weren't exactly holding up their end of the bargain. I'm not saying they weren't trying, but, you know, talk is cheap.

We've gotta protect our economy. Jobs, jobs, jobs, that's what I promised you, and that's what I'm gonna deliver. So we pulled out. We focused on real solutions, not just empty promises and virtue signaling. Things like clean coal technology, energy independence...these are things that actually put America first and help the environment at the same time.

Am I saying climate change isn't real? No sir. Am I saying we don't need to do anything about it? Of course not. But we gotta do it the *American* way. We gotta be smart, we gotta be strong, and we gotta protect our jobs and our economy. And that's exactly what we're doin'. Believe me.

"Can you provide an update on the Affordable Care Act's progress and its impact on American families and the economy, especially for my constituents?
","Hello, everybody. Before I begin I just want to express on behalf of the American people our deepest condolences to the Republic of Korea and the families of all those who’ve seen their loved ones lost when a ferry sank within the last couple of days. Obviously, information is still coming in. We know that many of the victims of this terrible tragedy were students. And American Navy personnel and Marines have already been on the scene helping the search and rescue. As one of our closest allies, our commitment to South Korea is unwavering in good times and in bad, and that's something I'll underscore during my visit to Seoul next week. Before I take questions I'd also like to say a few words about how the Affordable Care Act is now covering more people at less cost than most would have predicted just a few months ago. The first open enrollment period under this law ended a little over two weeks ago. And as more data comes in, we now know that the number of Americans who’ve signed up for private insurance in the marketplaces has grown to 8 million people -- 8 million people. Thirty-five percent of people who enrolled through the federal marketplace are under the age of 35. All told, independent experts now estimate that millions of Americans who were uninsured have gained coverage this year -- with millions more to come next year and the year after. We’ve also seen signs that the Affordable Care Act is bringing economic security to more Americans. Before this law added new transparency and competition to the individual market, folks who bought insurance on their own regularly saw double-digit increases in their premiums. That was the norm. And while we suspect that premiums will keep rising, as they have for decades, we also know that since the law took effect health care spending has risen more slowly than at any time in the past 50 years. In the decade before the Affordable Care Act, employer-based insurance rose almost 8 percent a year. Last year, it grew at half that rate. Under this law, real Medicare costs per person have nearly stopped growing. The life of the Medicare Trust Fund has been extended by 10 years. And the independent Congressional Budget Office now expects premiums for plans on the marketplace to be 15 percent lower than originally predicted. So those savings add up to more money that families can spend at businesses, more money that businesses can spend hiring new workers. And the CBO now says that the Affordable Care Act will be cheaper than recently projected. Lower costs from coverage provisions will shrink our deficits by an extra $100 billion. So the bottom line is, under the Affordable Care Act, the share of Americans with insurance is up, the growth of health care costs is down. Hundreds of millions of Americans who already have insurance now have new benefits and protections from free preventive care to freedom from lifetime caps on your care. No American with a preexisting condition like asthma or cancer can be denied coverage. No woman can be charged more just for being a woman. Those days are over. And this thing is working. I’ve said before, this law won’t solve all the problems in our health care system. We know we've got more work to do. But we now know for a fact that repealing the Affordable Care Act would increase the deficit, raise premiums for millions of Americans, and take insurance away from millions more -- which is why, as I've said before, I find it strange that the Republican position on this law is still stuck in the same place that it has always been. They still can’t bring themselves to admit that the Affordable Care Act is working. They said nobody would sign up; they were wrong about that. They said it would be unaffordable for the country; they were wrong about that. They were wrong to keep trying to repeal a law that is working when they have no alternative answer for millions of Americans with preexisting conditions who would be denied coverage again, or every woman who would be charged more for just being a woman again. I know every American isn’t going to agree with this law. But I think we can agree that it’s well past time to move on as a country and refocus our energy on the issues that the American people are most concerned about -- and that continues to be the economy. Because these endless, fruitless repeal efforts come at a cost. The 50 or so votes Republicans have taken to repeal this law could have been 50 votes to create jobs by investing in things like infrastructure or innovation. Or 50 votes to make it easier for middle-class families to send their kids to college. Or 50 votes to raise the minimum wage, or restore unemployment insurance that they let expire for folks working hard to find a new job. The point is the repeal debate is and should be over. The Affordable Care Act is working. And I know the American people don’t want us spending the next two and a half years refighting the settled political battles of the last five years. They sent us here to repair our economy, to rebuild our middle class, and to restore our founding promise of opportunity -- not just for a few, but for all. And as President, that’s exactly what I intend to keep doing as long as I’m in this office. With that, I’ll take some questions. Let’s see who we got. Kathleen Hennessey of the LA Times. Question: How long before health care ceases to become a political football, do you think? Are we talking years? Months? President Obama: I think it’s hard to say. It’s interesting, I spoke at the LBJ Library the other day, and most of us weren’t around to pay real close attention to those debates, or they're pretty distant now in the past. Apparently it took several years before people realized, hey, Medicare actually works and it’s lifting a lot of seniors out of despair and poverty. So we’ve been through this cycle before. It happens each and every time we make some strides in terms of strengthening our commitments to each other and we expand some of these social insurance programs. There’s a lot of fear-mongering and a lot of political argument and debate, and a lot of accusations are flung back and forth about socialized medicine and the end of freedom. And then it turns out that, you know what, it’s working for a lot of folks, and we still live in a free- market society and the Constitution is intact. And then we move on. And I don't know how long it’s going to take. But in the meantime, how about us focusing on some things that the American people really care about? Thank you, everybody. 2 Joint Press Conference with Prime Minister Abe","Well now, let's talk about this Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare as some folks like to call it. Look, I always believed in folks having access to good healthcare, but this here law... it's been a mixed bag, wouldn't you say?

On the one hand, more Americans *did* get insurance coverage. No denying that. We saw a dip in the uninsured rate, and that's a good thing, especially for working families who were struggling to make ends meet. Folks who were previously denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions, well, they got a shot. I understand that. 

Now, for your constituents, and believe me, I hear you, there have been real concerns. Premiums went up for many families, and deductibles, Lord have mercy, they just kept climbing. That made it harder for folks to actually afford to *use* their insurance. And then there was the issue of folks losing the plans they liked. Remember that promise? Well... things didn't quite work out that way for everyone.

Economically, it's been a debate, plain and simple. Some say it helped the economy by expanding access to care and reducing uncompensated care costs for hospitals. Others, and I tend to agree with them, argue it created a lot of uncertainty for businesses and stifled job growth because of the added costs and regulations.

So, the bottom line? Obamacare did some good, sure. But it also created a whole lotta problems. It's a complicated law, and frankly, it probably needs some serious fixing, some major reforms, to really work for all Americans. We gotta find a way to get healthcare costs down, give people more choices, and make sure everyone has access to quality care without bankrupting the country or their own families. That's what I always strived for, and I hope the next fella can get it done.
